  "fullDescription": "Primordial Force of Desire and God of Love\n\nEros occupies a unique dual position in Greek mythology—simultaneously one of the first beings to emerge from primordial Chaos and the youthful son of Aphrodite, goddess of love. This duality reflects the Greeks' understanding of love itself: as a fundamental cosmic principle that makes creation possible (the elder, primordial Eros), and as the passionate, sometimes capricious force that strikes individual hearts (the younger, Olympian Eros). Whether ancient cosmic power or mischievous divine child, Eros represents desire's irresistible pull—the force that draws all things together, from atoms to gods, enabling both physical generation and spiritual union. His most famous myth, the love story of Eros and Psyche, explores how desire transforms into genuine love through trial, loss, and ultimate reunion.\n\nGreek theology recognized two distinct conceptions of Eros, often conflated but philosophically separable:",
