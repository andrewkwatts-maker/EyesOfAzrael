Abducted by Hades to become Queen of the Underworld, she spends half the year below with the dead and half above bringing spring's renewal, creating the seasons through her eternal journey between realms.\n\nPersephone's mythology centers on her abduction and the resulting explanation for the seasons, but she also holds sovereign power as Queen of the Underworld, ruling alongside Hades and presiding over the mysteries of death and rebirth.",
