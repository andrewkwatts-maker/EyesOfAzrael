  "longDescription": "Manjushri (Sanskrit: 'Gentle Glory') embodies the prajna (transcendent wisdom) of all Buddhas. He wields the flaming sword of discriminating awareness that cuts through ignorance, delusion, and dualistic thinking, revealing the empty nature of all phenomena. Depicted as a youthful prince of sixteen years representing the eternal freshness of wisdom, he holds the Prajnaparamita Sutra on a lotus in his left hand while raising the sword in his right. He rides upon a lion symbolizing the fearless proclamation of Dharma. According to the Manjushri Mulakalpa, he was formerly Buddha Lampadhara who voluntarily relinquished his Buddha status to become a bodhisattva, taking a subordinate position to better serve sentient beings. He is revered as the patron of scholars, teachers, and all who seek understanding of ultimate truth. His sacred mantra is Om A Ra Pa Ca Na Dhih, and his primary sacred site is Mount Wutai in China.",
