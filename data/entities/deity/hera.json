  "fullDescription": "Queen of the Gods, Goddess of Marriage and Family\n\nWife and sister of Zeus, Hera rules as Queen of Olympus and protector of marriage, women, and childbirth. Though her mythology is dominated by Zeus's infidelities and her vengeful responses, she represents the sacred institution of marriage and the sovereignty of divine queenship.\n\nHera's mythology centers on her tumultuous marriage to Zeus, her fierce protection of marital sanctity, and her vengeful pursuit of Zeus's lovers and illegitimate children. Yet she also represents legitimate sovereignty and the power of the divine queen.",
