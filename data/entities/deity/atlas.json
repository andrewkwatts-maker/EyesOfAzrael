  "fullDescription": "Bearer of the Heavens - The Titan Who Holds the Sky\n\nAtlas is the Titan condemned by Zeus to hold up the celestial sphere at the western edge of the world. Brother of Prometheus, his punishment following the Titanomachy became one of mythology's most enduring images of cosmic burden and divine retribution.\n\nIn Hesiod's Theogony, Atlas is named among the sons of the Titan Iapetus and the Oceanid Clymene (or Asia). His brothers include Prometheus ('Forethought'), Epimetheus ('Afterthought'), and Menoetius. When the Titans warred against the Olympians in the Titanomachy, Atlas fought on the side of his kindred.\n\nHesiod describes his punishment:\n\n'And Atlas through hard constraint upholds the wide heaven with unwearying head and arms, standing at the borders of the earth before the clear-voiced Hesperides; for this lot wise Zeus assigned to him.'\n\nThe Location of Atlas\n\nAtlas stands at the far west of the world, near the garden of the Hesperides where the golden apples grow. This location, at the edge of the known world where the sun sets, placed him at the boundary between the mortal realm and the cosmic beyond. The Atlas Mountains in North Africa bear his name, and ancient Greeks imagined him as the personification of these great peaks supporting the heavens.\n\nEncounter with Perseus\n\nIn later tradition, the hero Perseus, returning from slaying Medusa, encountered Atlas. When the Titan refused him hospitality (some say warned by an oracle that a son of Zeus would steal his golden apples), Perseus used Medusa's head to turn Atlas to stone - thus explaining the Atlas Mountains as his petrified form.\n\nEncounter with Heracles\n\nDuring his eleventh labor (fetching the golden apples of the Hesperides), Heracles came to Atlas. The hero offered to hold the sky while Atlas retrieved the apples. When Atlas returned, he suggested that Heracles keep holding the sky permanently. Heracles agreed but asked Atlas to take the burden briefly while he placed a pad on his shoulders. Once Atlas took the sky again, Heracles departed with the apples, leaving Atlas eternally bound to his task.\n\nCosmological Significance\n\nAtlas's punishment explains why the sky does not fall. In Greek cosmology, the separation of Earth (Gaia) and Sky (Uranus) - achieved through Cronos's castration - must be maintained. Atlas is the force that holds this cosmic architecture in place. His name may derive from the Greek τλῆναι (tlenai) meaning 'to bear' or 'to endure,' marking him as 'the bearer.'\n\nLegacy\n\nAtlas gave his name to:\n- The Atlantic Ocean (the sea beyond his mountains)\n- The Atlas Mountains of North Africa\n- The atlas (book of maps, from Mercator's 16th-century collection featuring Atlas)\n- The atlas vertebra (first cervical vertebra supporting the skull)\n- In anatomy, the atlas bone that supports the head",
