  "shortDescription": "Goddess of Truth, Justice, Cosmic Order, and Balance",
  "longDescription": "Ma'at is both goddess and cosmic principle, embodying truth, justice, harmony, balance, order, and righteousness. She is the foundation of Egyptian civilization and the moral law that governs both gods and humans. Ma'at represents the opposite of chaos (isfet) and her feather weighs souls in the afterlife. To \"do ma'at\" meant to live righteously, maintain social order, and uphold divine law.\n\nCosmic Foundation: Ma'at was present at creation when Ra emerged from the primordial waters of Nun. She represents the order that replaced chaos. Ra stood on ma'at as his foundation when creating the world. Without ma'at, the universe would collapse back into chaos (isfet).\n\nThe Weighing of the Heart: In the Hall of Two Truths, the deceased's heart is weighed against Ma'at's feather by Anubis. A heart heavy with sin outweighs the feather and is devoured by Ammit, denying the soul eternal life. A heart lighter than or equal to the feather proves the deceased lived according to ma'at and may enter the Field of Reeds. Thoth records the result.\n\nPharaoh's Duty: Every pharaoh was crowned with the responsibility to \"do ma'at\" and \"present ma'at to the gods.\" Temple reliefs show pharaohs offering a small figure of Ma'at to the gods, symbolizing that just rule maintains cosmic order. If a pharaoh failed to uphold ma'at, chaos would engulf Egypt.\n\nCompanion of Ra: Ma'at rides in Ra's solar barque during his daily journey across the sky. Her presence maintains order and helps Ra resist Apep's chaos. She represents the stability that allows the sun to rise each day.\n\nEthical Living: Ma'at encompassed practical ethics: speaking truth, acting justly, being generous to the poor, respecting parents, honoring the gods, maintaining proper conduct. The \"Negative Confession\" in the Book of the Dead lists 42 sins the deceased must deny committing, each denial affirming they lived by ma'at.",
