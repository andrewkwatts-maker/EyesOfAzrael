  "fullDescription": "Primordial Earth Mother, Foundation of All Life\n\nGaia, the personification of Earth itself, stands as one of the first beings to emerge from primordial Chaos at creation's dawn. She is not merely a goddess who rules the earth—she is the Earth, the living foundation from which all subsequent life springs. As the great mother, she bore the mountains, the sea, and the sky from her own substance, then mated with her creations to produce the Titans, Giants, and countless other beings. Gaia represents the fundamental generative power of nature, the nurturing force that sustains all life, and the terrible vengeance of the earth when her children are threatened. Her story spans the entire Greek cosmic order, from creation through the rise of the Olympians, always as the ancient power that predates and outlasts all dynasties of gods.\n\nAccording to Hesiod's Theogony, the definitive account of Greek creation, first there was Chaos—the primordial void, the gaping emptiness. From Chaos emerged the first beings: Gaia (Earth), Tartarus (the deep abyss), Eros (primordial desire), Erebus (darkness), and Nyx (night). Gaia arose spontaneously, without parent or creator, making her one of the fundamental building blocks of reality.",
