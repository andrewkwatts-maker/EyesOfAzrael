  "fullDescription": "Cronos (also spelled Kronos or Cronus) was the youngest and most powerful of the twelve Titans, ruling over the Golden Age before being overthrown by his own children. As lord of time and harvest, he embodied both agricultural abundance and the inexorable passage of ages. His most notorious act - devouring his own children to prevent the prophecy of his downfall - has become one of mythology's most powerful symbols of time consuming all things.\n\nCronos was the youngest son of Uranus (Sky) and Gaia (Earth). When Uranus imprisoned his children - the Cyclopes and Hecatoncheires - within Gaia's womb, causing her great pain, she fashioned an adamantine sickle and asked her children to castrate their father. Only Cronos had the courage to accept this terrible task.\n\nWhen Uranus came to couple with Gaia, Cronos ambushed him, severing his genitals with the sickle and casting them into the sea. From the blood that fell upon Gaia sprang the Furies, Giants, and Meliae (ash-tree nymphs). From the sea foam where the genitals landed, Aphrodite was born. With Uranus deposed, Cronos freed his siblings and became king of the Titans, inaugurating the Golden Age of humanity.",
