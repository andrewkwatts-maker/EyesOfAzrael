  "fullDescription": "Goddess of the Harvest, Agriculture, and Sacred Law\n\nMother goddess who presides over the grain harvest, fertility of the earth, and the cycle of life and death. Demeter's grief over her daughter's abduction created the seasons and established the Eleusinian Mysteries, the most sacred rites of ancient Greece promising hope for the afterlife.\n\nDemeter's mythology centers on her role as mother, her grief, and the power she wields over the earth's fertility. Her most important myth explains the origin of seasons and forms the foundation of the Eleusinian Mysteries.",
