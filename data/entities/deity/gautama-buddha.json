  "shortDescription": "The historical Buddha who attained enlightenment under the Bodhi Tree and taught the path to liberation",
  "fullDescription": "Siddhartha Gautama (c. 563-483 BCE), known as Buddha Shakyamuni ('Sage of the Shakyas'), was a spiritual teacher who founded Buddhism. Born a prince in Lumbini (modern Nepal), he renounced his privileged life at age 29 to seek the end of suffering. After six years of ascetic practices and meditation, he attained perfect enlightenment (bodhi) under a Bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya. For 45 years, he traveled the Gangetic plain teaching the Dharma—the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path—to all castes and classes. The Buddha represents the potential for awakening present in all beings. He is depicted in various mudras (hand gestures): Dharmachakra mudra (teaching), Bhumisparsha mudra (earth-witness), Dhyana mudra (meditation), and Abhaya mudra (fearlessness). His teachings emphasize the Middle Way between extreme asceticism and sensual indulgence, the impermanent and interdependent nature of all phenomena, and the possibility of liberation from samsara through ethical conduct, meditation, and wisdom. The Buddha explicitly rejected the authority of the Vedas and the caste system, teaching that enlightenment is achievable through one's own effort regardless of birth.",

The simple monk's robes represent renunciation and humility. The Bodhi tree symbolizes the site and moment of awakening.",
      "culturalSignificance": "The Buddha is the central figure of Buddhism, revered by over 500 million adherents worldwide. He is honored not as a god but as a supreme teacher who rediscovered and taught the ancient path to enlightenment. Taking refuge in the Buddha (along with Dharma and Sangha) is the foundational act of becoming Buddhist. The Buddha's life story—from prince to ascetic to enlightened teacher—provides the archetypal spiritual journey. His emphasis on personal experience, ethical conduct, and mental training over faith and ritual revolutionized Indian spirituality. The Buddha's rejection of caste and inclusion of women in the sangha was socially revolutionary. His teachings spread throughout Asia, adapting to local cultures while maintaining core principles."
