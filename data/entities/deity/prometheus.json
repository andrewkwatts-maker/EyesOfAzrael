  "fullDescription": "The Fire-Bringer, Champion of Humanity\n\nThe rebellious Titan whose name means \"Forethought,\" Prometheus defied the will of Zeus to bring the gift of fire to humanity. His story embodies the eternal struggle between divine authority and the advancement of civilization, between tyranny and the liberation of knowledge.\n\nPrometheus's mythology traces the arc of humanity's rise from helpless creatures to beings possessed of divine knowledge. His acts of defiance against Zeus and the terrible punishment he endured have made him an eternal symbol of rebellion against tyranny and the cost of progress.",
