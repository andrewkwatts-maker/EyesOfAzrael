  "shortDescription": "Chief deity of the Tuatha Dé Danann, master of life and death, wielder of cosmic power over nature's cycles and abundance",
  "longDescription": "The Dagda is the archetypal Celtic father god - powerful beyond measure, crude in manner yet wise beyond comprehension, simultaneously comical and awe-inspiring. His very name, 'The Good God,' refers not to moral goodness but to his mastery of all skills and his ability to provide for his people.\n\nHe is depicted as a figure of immense physical size and appetite, wearing a short tunic that barely covers him and dragging a massive club that requires eight men to move. Yet this crude appearance masks his profound wisdom and supernatural power over life, death, and the cosmic order itself.\n\nAs chief druid and builder for the Tuatha Dé Danann, the Dagda wields three primary treasures: the Cauldron of Plenty (Coire Ansic) which feeds all without emptying, the mighty club (Lorg Mór) whose one end kills and the other revives, and the magical harp (Uaithne) that controls emotions and the seasons themselves.",
