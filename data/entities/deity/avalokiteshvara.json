  "fullDescription": "Avalokiteshvara (Sanskrit: 'The Lord Who Looks Down'), known as Guanyin in China, Kannon in Japan, and Chenrezig in Tibet, is the bodhisattva of infinite compassion (karuna). He embodies the compassionate activity of all Buddhas, hearing the cries of suffering beings throughout the universe and responding with skillful means to liberate them. He has vowed not to enter final nirvana until all sentient beings are freed from samsara. According to the Karandavyuha Sutra, when Avalokiteshvara realized the immensity of suffering despite his efforts, his head split into eleven pieces from anguish. Amitabha Buddha reconstructed him with eleven heads (to see in all directions) and 1,000 arms (to reach all beings), each hand bearing an eye representing wisdom seeing the true nature of suffering. The sacred mantra Om Mani Padme Hum is inseparable from Avalokiteshvara, containing the essence of the Buddha's 84,000 teachings. In East Asian Buddhism, Avalokiteshvara gradually transformed into the feminine Guanyin, the Goddess of Mercy, demonstrating that ultimate compassion transcends gender. The Dalai Lamas are considered tulkus (emanations) of Avalokiteshvara.",

The wish-fulfilling jewel grants spiritual and material needs. Prayer beads count mantras for liberating beings. The water vase contains amrita (nectar of compassion) that heals and purifies. The white color symbolizes purity and compassion. The royal ease posture shows accessibility and readiness to help.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Avalokiteshvara is one of the most beloved and widely venerated figures in Mahayana Buddhism, with devotees across Tibet, China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, and beyond. The practice of reciting Om Mani Padme Hum is central to Tibetan Buddhism. The Dalai Lamas are considered tulkus (reincarnations) of Avalokiteshvara, making this bodhisattva integral to Tibetan political and spiritual identity. In China, the feminine transformation into Guanyin represents Buddhism's adaptation to local culture and the teaching that compassion transcends gender. The legend of Princess Miaoshan sacrificing her eyes and arms to save her father powerfully illustrates selfless compassion. Avalokiteshvara's vow to not enter nirvana until all beings are liberated exemplifies the Mahayana ideal that individual salvation is incomplete while others suffer."
