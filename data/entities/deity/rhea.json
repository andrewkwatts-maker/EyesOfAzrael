  "fullDescription": "Mother of the Olympians - Titan Queen Who Saved Zeus\n\nRhea is the Titan goddess of fertility, motherhood, and generation. As the sister-wife of Cronos and mother of the six elder Olympians, she occupies a pivotal role in Greek succession mythology. When Cronos devoured their children to prevent the prophecy of his overthrow, Rhea conspired with Gaia to save the youngest, Zeus, setting in motion the downfall of Titan rule and the rise of the Olympian order.\n\nIn Hesiod's Theogony, Rhea is one of the twelve Titans born to Gaia (Earth) and Uranus (Sky). Her name may derive from the Greek word for 'flow' or 'ease,' connecting her to the flowing of generations, the ease of birth, and the abundance of the earth. She is closely associated with the Phrygian goddess Cybele, the 'Mountain Mother,' and later traditions often conflated the two.\n\nThe Tragedy of Motherhood\n\nRhea bore six children to Cronos: Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, Poseidon, and Zeus. But Cronos, warned by Gaia and Uranus that one of his children would overthrow him as he had overthrown his own father, swallowed each child as soon as it was born. Hesiod describes the grief of Rhea:\n\n'Great Cronos kept swallowing them as each came from the holy womb to his mother's knees, with this intent, that no other of the proud sons of Heaven should hold the kingly office amongst the immortals. For he learned from Earth and starry Heaven that he was destined to be overcome by his own son.'\n\nThe Deception and Salvation of Zeus\n\nWhen Rhea was about to give birth to Zeus, she sought help from her parents Gaia and Uranus. They sent her to Crete, to the cave of Dicte (or Ida), where she gave birth in secret. In place of the infant, she wrapped a great stone in swaddling clothes and presented it to Cronos, who swallowed it, believing it to be his youngest son.\n\nThus Zeus was saved and hidden in Crete, where he was nursed by nymphs and fed on the milk of the goat Amalthea, while the Curetes (divine warriors) clashed their shields to cover the sound of his cries. When Zeus grew to maturity, he returned to force Cronos to regurgitate his siblings, and together they waged the Titanomachy that established Olympian rule.\n\nCult and Worship\n\nRhea was worshipped throughout Greece, often in association with Cybele. Her cult centers included Crete (where Zeus was born), Arcadia, and Phrygia. She was honored as the 'Mother of the Gods' and associated with lions, drums, and ecstatic worship. The Romans identified her with Ops, goddess of abundance.\n\nSymbolic Significance\n\nRhea embodies the protective power of motherhood against tyrannical patriarchy. Her deception of Cronos parallels Gaia's instigation of Uranus's castration - in both cases, the mother acts to protect her children from an oppressive father. This pattern of maternal cunning defeating paternal tyranny runs throughout Greek succession myth.",
