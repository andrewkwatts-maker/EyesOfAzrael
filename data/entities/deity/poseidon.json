  "fullDescription": "God of the Sea, Earthquakes, and Horses\n\nOne of the three great sons of Kronos who divided the cosmos, Poseidon commands the vast oceans, shakes the earth with his mighty trident, and created the first horses. Known as the Earth-Shaker and Lord of the Seas, he embodies the dual nature of water itself: life-giving sustenance and terrifying destruction. Sailors, fishermen, and coastal peoples throughout the ancient world honored this tempestuous deity.\n\nPoseidon's mythology reflects the ancient Greeks' profound and ambivalent relationship with the sea. As god of all waters, he could grant safe passage and bountiful catches, or unleash devastating storms and earthquakes. His temperament was as changeable as the ocean itself, quick to anger but capable of great benevolence to those who honored him.",
