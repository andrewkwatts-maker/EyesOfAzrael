Born fully grown and armored from Zeus's head, Athena embodies disciplined intelligence, just warfare, and civilized arts. Patron of Athens and protector of heroes.\n\nAthena's myths emphasize intelligence over brute force, justice over vengeance, and civilized order over chaos. As Zeus's favorite daughter, she alone was permitted to wield his thunderbolt and aegis. Her virgin status represents independence and self-sufficiency rather than weakness.",
