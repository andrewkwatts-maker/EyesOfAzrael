  "fullDescription": "Virgin Goddess of the Hearth, Home, and Sacred Fire\n\nHestia, eldest child of Cronus and Rhea, stands as one of Greek mythology's most paradoxical figures—simultaneously the most honored and the least storied, the most central and the most self-effacing of deities. As goddess of the hearth fire, she embodied the literal and metaphorical center of home and city. Every sacrifice began and ended with offerings to Hestia; every house and temple contained her sacred flame; every meal was shared in her presence. Yet she appears in almost no myths, generates no scandals, bears no children, fights no battles. Her power lay not in dramatic action but in quiet presence—the eternal flame that transforms a building into a home, strangers into a family, scattered individuals into a polis. She represents stability, permanence, and the sacred nature of domestic space in a mythology otherwise filled with passion, conflict, and transformation.\n\nHestia was the firstborn child of the Titans Cronus and Rhea, making her the eldest of the Olympian generation. But this distinction brought immediate danger: Cronus, fearing the prophecy that he would be overthrown by his own child, swallowed Hestia whole immediately after her birth. Her siblings followed—Demeter, Hera, Hades, and Poseidon—each swallowed in turn.",
