  "longDescription": "Anubis is the ancient jackal-headed god of death, mummification, and the afterlife. As the original lord of the necropolis and guide of souls through the Duat, Anubis stands as protector of the dead and guardian of the scales of judgment. His presence ensures proper burial rites and safe passage to the realm of Osiris.\n\nThe Mummification of Osiris: When Set murdered and dismembered Osiris, Anubis invented mummification to preserve Osiris's body. Working with Isis and Nephthys, Anubis performed the first embalming, creating the techniques that would be used throughout Egyptian history. This established mummification as a sacred act that could grant eternal life.\n\nGuardian of the Scales: In the Hall of Two Truths, Anubis oversees the weighing of the heart ceremony. He places the deceased's heart on one side of the scales and the feather of Ma'at (truth and justice) on the other. If the heart is lighter than the feather, the soul may pass to the Field of Reeds. If heavier with sin, the heart is devoured by Ammit. Thoth records the judgment, but Anubis ensures the scales remain true.\n\nBattle Against Set: After helping restore Osiris, Anubis fought alongside Horus against Set. In some versions, Anubis captured Set and flayed him, wearing his skin as a warning to those who would desecrate tombs. This established Anubis as protector against forces of chaos that threaten the dead.\n\nGuide Through the Duat: Anubis leads souls through the perilous twelve regions of the Duat, protecting them from demons and guiding them past obstacles. His knowledge of secret paths and passwords allows the properly prepared dead to navigate safely to judgment.",
