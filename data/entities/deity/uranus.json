  "fullDescription": "Primordial Sky Father, First King of the Cosmos\n\nUranus, the personification of the sky itself, stands as one of the first beings in Greek cosmology—born from Gaia (Earth) alone, then becoming both her son and her consort. As the dome of heaven covering the earth, Uranus represents the masculine creative principle complementing Gaia's feminine fertility. Yet his story is primarily one of tyranny and violent overthrow. The first ruler of the cosmos, Uranus imprisoned his monstrous children and suppressed his Titan offspring, until his own son Cronus, at Gaia's instigation, castrated him with an adamantine sickle. This act of primal violence—child against father, sky separated from earth—established the pattern of succession through patricide that would define Greek divine kingship and created the space between heaven and earth where mortal life could flourish.\n\nAccording to Hesiod's Theogony, after Chaos came Gaia (Earth), who through parthenogenesis (virgin birth) produced Uranus (Sky). He was born from her alone, without a father, making him simultaneously her son and her equal opposite. Uranus embodied the vast starry heavens—the celestial dome that arched over Gaia's terrestrial foundation. The name \"Uranus\" (Οὐρανός) literally means \"sky\" or \"heaven\" in Greek, identifying the god completely with the physical phenomenon he personified.",
