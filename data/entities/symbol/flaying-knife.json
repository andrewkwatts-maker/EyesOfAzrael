  "fullDescription": "The flaying knife is the primary iconographic attribute of Saint Bartholomew, representing his martyrdom by being skinned alive in Armenia. According to tradition, after evangelizing India and Armenia, Bartholomew was ordered executed by King Astyages for converting the king's brother Polymius to Christianity. The method of execution - flaying (removal of skin while alive) - became one of the most distinctive and memorable martyrdoms in Christian hagiography. This gruesome death gave Bartholomew his patronage of tanners, leatherworkers, and all trades involving animal skins. In Michelangelo's Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel, Bartholomew is depicted holding his own flayed skin in one hand and the flaying knife in the other - a striking image of complete self-surrender. The face on the hanging skin is believed to be Michelangelo's self-portrait, suggesting the artist's own spiritual identification with total dedication to God. The symbol represents the ultimate stripping away of self, earthly identity surrendered for heavenly glory. It connects to Paul's teaching of 'putting off the old man' (Colossians 3:9) and being 'crucified with Christ' (Galatians 2:20). The flaying knife thus symbolizes the cost of discipleship and the transformation that occurs when nothing is held back from God.",

      "symbolism": "The flaying knife represents the most extreme form of martyrdom - not a quick death but prolonged, agonizing stripping of the self. This connects to Christian teaching about dying to self, taking up one's cross, and following Christ regardless of cost. Bartholomew's willingness to endure this death exemplifies the apostolic commitment. The image of holding one's own skin (as in Michelangelo's fresco) represents standing before God's judgment having surrendered everything earthly. It illustrates the teaching that 'all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do' (Hebrews 4:13).",
      "culturalSignificance": "The flaying knife became Bartholomew's standard iconographic attribute from medieval times onward. He is depicted holding it in countless paintings, sculptures, and church windows. Michelangelo's Last Judgment (1536-1541) created the most famous image of Bartholomew with his skin, influencing all subsequent artistic representations. The symbol connected Bartholomew to the tanning guilds, who venerated him as patron. Armenian Christianity particularly honors this martyrdom as foundational to their apostolic church. August 24 (his feast day) has been observed with special guild celebrations in leatherworking communities."
