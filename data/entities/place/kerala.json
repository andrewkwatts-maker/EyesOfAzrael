  "fullDescription": "Kerala, on India's southwestern Malabar Coast, is the heartland of one of the world's oldest Christian communities - the Mar Thoma (St. Thomas) Christians. According to their unbroken tradition, the apostle Thomas arrived at the port of Muziris (modern Kodungallur) in 52 CE, establishing Christianity among both the Jewish diaspora community and local high-caste families. Thomas is credited with founding the 'Seven and a Half Churches' at seven locations along the coast, plus a half-church, before his martyrdom at Mylapore. These churches at Malankara (Kodungallur), Palayur, Paravur, Kokkamangalam, Niranam, Chayal, and Quilon (Kollam), plus Thiruvithamcode, represent the earliest Christian foundations in India. The Mar Thoma Christians developed their own distinctive traditions, using Syriac liturgy and maintaining ecclesiastical connections with the Church of the East in Mesopotamia rather than with Rome or Constantinople. They integrated into Indian society while preserving Christian faith, adopting Hindu social customs in non-religious matters. When Portuguese colonizers arrived in 1498, they were astonished to find an ancient, organized Christian community that predated European Christianity. The Synod of Diamper (1599) attempted to Latinize these communities, leading to eventual schisms that produced today's diverse Kerala Christian churches (Syro-Malabar, Malankara Orthodox, Mar Thoma Evangelical, and others). Kerala today has the highest percentage of Christians of any Indian state (about 18%), making it a unique Christian presence in Asia.",
