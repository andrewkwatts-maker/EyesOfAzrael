  "fullDescription": "The Mahabodhi Temple marks the most sacred site in Buddhism—the location where Prince Siddhartha Gautama attained enlightenment and became the Buddha approximately 2,500 years ago (c. 528 BCE). The temple complex stands beside the Bodhi Tree, a direct descendant of the original tree under which the Buddha meditated for 49 days before achieving nirvana. The current temple structure, a 55-meter tall pyramid-shaped tower built entirely of brick, dates from the 5th-6th century CE during the late Gupta period, making it one of the earliest and most significant brick temples to survive from ancient India. The site includes the sacred Bodhi Tree, the Vajrasana (Diamond Throne) marking the exact spot of enlightenment, meditation platforms commemorating the seven weeks following enlightenment, and numerous votive stupas erected by pilgrims over centuries. Emperor Ashoka established the first shrine here c. 260 BCE. The temple has witnessed Buddhism's full arc in India—from its golden age through centuries of decline following Muslim invasions to its 19th-century rediscovery and restoration. UNESCO designated the complex a World Heritage Site in 2002. For over two millennia, pilgrims from across Asia have traveled to this spot, making it the most important pilgrimage destination in Buddhism, revered equally by Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana traditions.",

The Vajrasana (Diamond Throne) marks the 'navel of the earth' in Buddhist cosmology, believed to be the immovable spot throughout cosmic cycles where all Buddhas of past, present, and future achieve enlightenment. The Bodhi Tree symbolizes the living connection to Buddha's awakening—a direct botanical descendant linking present pilgrims to that transformative moment 2,500 years ago. The temple's pyramid structure represents the upward journey toward enlightenment. The seven locations commemorating Buddha's seven weeks after enlightenment map a sacred geography of meditation, contemplation, and spiritual consolidation. The site embodies the possibility of human transformation from ignorance to perfect wisdom.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Mahabodhi Temple is the holiest site in Buddhism, surpassing even Buddha's birthplace (Lumbini), first sermon site (Sarnath), and death location (Kushinagar). All Buddhist traditions—Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana—equally revere the site, making pilgrimage here a life goal for devout Buddhists worldwide. Merit gained by pilgrimage is considered immense. The temple influenced Buddhist architectural styles across Asia, from Sri Lanka to Tibet to Japan. The Bodhi Tree's descendants have been planted at Buddhist sites globally, spreading the sacred lineage. Modern international monasteries surrounding the complex (Thai, Tibetan, Japanese, Bhutanese, etc.) demonstrate Buddhism's global reach. The site symbolizes both Buddhism's Indian origins and its transcendence of geographic and sectarian boundaries. Contemporary challenges include balancing Hindu-Buddhist joint management, mass tourism impact, and security concerns."
