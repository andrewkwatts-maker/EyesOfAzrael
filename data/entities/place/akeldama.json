  "fullDescription": "Akeldama (Aramaic: Haqel D'ma, 'Field of Blood') is a site in Jerusalem carrying dark significance in Christian tradition. According to the Gospel of Matthew (27:3-10), after Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus for thirty pieces of silver and saw Jesus condemned, he was seized with remorse. He returned the blood money to the chief priests, declaring 'I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood.' When the priests refused to put the money into the temple treasury because it was 'the price of blood,' they used it to purchase a potter's field as a burial place for strangers. Matthew connects this to prophecy, quoting Zechariah 11:12-13 (attributed to Jeremiah). Acts 1:18-19 provides an alternate account: Judas himself purchased the field, and 'falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out,' hence the name 'field of blood' referring to his gruesome death rather than the blood money. The traditional site of Akeldama is located in the Hinnom Valley (Gehenna) south of the Old City, on the steep southern slope of the valley. The area was known for its clay deposits used by potters, explaining the designation 'potter's field.' By the Byzantine era, the site was used as a charnel house and burial ground. Today, a Greek Orthodox monastery (St. Onuphrius) marks the traditional location. Akeldama stands as a memorial to the consequences of betrayal, the corruption of blood money, and the fulfillment of prophetic scripture.",
