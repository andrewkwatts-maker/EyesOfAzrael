  "fullDescription": "Penglai (蓬萊, Pénglái) is one of the legendary eastern paradises where immortals (xian) dwell in eternal bliss. Part of the mythical Three Islands of the Immortals (along with Fangzhang and Yingzhou), Penglai is described as a floating mountain supported by giant turtles, perpetually shrouded in mist and impossible for mortals to reach. The island contains palaces of gold and jade, magical herbs including the elixir of immortality, and is inhabited by enlightened beings who have transcended death. Multiple Chinese emperors, most notably Qin Shi Huang, sent expeditions to find these islands.",

      "symbolism": "Penglai represents the paradox of the spiritual quest - the destination that can be seen but never reached through ordinary means. Its floating nature symbolizes transcendence of earthly attachment. The mist surrounding it represents the veil between mortal and immortal realms. The eastern location connects it to sunrise, renewal, and the wood element associated with growth and vitality.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Penglai has inspired Chinese art, literature, and spiritual practice for over two millennia. The historical town of Penglai in Shandong province takes its name from the legend. The concept influenced Japanese mythology (Horai) and remains a powerful symbol of the unattainable ideal and spiritual aspiration."
