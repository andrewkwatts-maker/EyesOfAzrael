  "fullDescription": "Patala (Sanskrit: पाताल) is the lowest and seventh of the subterranean realms (lokas) in Hindu cosmology, located deep beneath the earth. Contrary to Western concepts of hell, Patala is described as a place of great beauty, luxury, and pleasure - in some texts even more splendid than Swarga (heaven). It is primarily inhabited by the Nagas (serpent beings), Daityas and Danavas (types of Asuras/demons), and various other powerful beings. The realm is ruled by various naga kings including Vasuki and the demon king Bali. Patala has magnificent cities built of gold and jewels, illuminated by the radiance of precious stones since sunlight does not reach there. Despite its beauty, Patala is not a place of spiritual liberation. Above Patala are six other underworlds: Atala, Vitala, Sutala, Talatala, Mahatala, and Rasatala, each with its own inhabitants and characteristics.",

      "symbolism": "Patala represents the hidden, subconscious depths of existence. As the lowest realm, it symbolizes the foundation upon which the universe rests. The surprising beauty of Patala teaches that materiality and pleasure exist at all levels of reality, not just in heaven. The nagas of Patala represent primal forces, kundalini energy, and hidden knowledge. The presence of righteous King Bali in Patala shows that virtue exists even in the lower realms and that power does not equal evil. Patala's illumination by jewels rather than sunlight represents alternative sources of consciousness and awareness.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Patala features prominently in Hindu mythology and folk tales. The nagas of Patala are worshiped in many parts of India for protection and prosperity. Stories of heroes descending to Patala to rescue kidnapped persons or retrieve lost objects are common. The concept has influenced art, temple architecture (underground shrines), and spiritual practices. Unlike hell-realms in some traditions, Patala is not necessarily a place of suffering, showing the nuanced Hindu cosmology where beauty and pleasure exist across multiple realms."
