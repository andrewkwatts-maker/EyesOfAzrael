  "fullDescription": "Hierapolis (Greek: 'Holy City') was a major Greco-Roman city in Phrygia, Asia Minor (modern Pamukkale, Turkey), renowned for its therapeutic hot springs, necropolis, and significance in early Christianity. Founded in the 2nd century BCE as part of the Seleucid Kingdom, the city became a center of textile production, particularly wool dyeing, taking advantage of the mineral-rich waters from the famous white travertine terraces.\n\nFor Christians, Hierapolis holds profound significance as the site of Philip the Apostle's martyrdom and burial. According to tradition, Philip evangelized extensively in Phrygia after Pentecost, converting many pagans and confronting the worship of serpents and pagan deities. He was reportedly martyred during the reign of Emperor Domitian (81-96 CE), either by crucifixion or by being hung upside down. In 2011, Italian archaeologists led by Francesco D'Andria announced the discovery of Philip's tomb in the ancient city's northern area, beneath an octagonal martyrium dating to the 5th century.\n\nThe city was also home to Papias, the early 2nd-century bishop whose writings preserve important traditions about the apostles and Gospel origins. The Stoic philosopher Epictetus was born a slave in Hierapolis before gaining his freedom and founding his influential school.\n\nHierapolis was severely damaged by earthquakes in 17 CE and 60 CE, requiring extensive rebuilding. Despite destruction, it remained an important pilgrimage destination for Christians honoring Philip. The city's monumental ruins, including a theater, baths, temples, and the extensive ancient necropolis, make it a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The white calcium terraces of Pamukkale ('Cotton Castle' in Turkish) continue to draw visitors to this ancient 'holy city' where an apostle's witness concluded in martyrdom.",

Today, the site combines Christian pilgrimage with tourism to the spectacular travertine terraces of Pamukkale."

The city's textile industry, especially wool dyeing, created economic prosperity. The Plutonium, with its lethal carbon dioxide emissions, became a tourist attraction where priests demonstrated their 'immunity' (by holding their breath). Epictetus's birth here as a slave, followed by his rise to philosophical prominence, illustrates the social mobility possible in the Roman world."
