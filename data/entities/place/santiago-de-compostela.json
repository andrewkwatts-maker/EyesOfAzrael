  "fullDescription": "Santiago de Compostela, meaning 'Saint James of the Field of Stars,' has been one of the three most important Christian pilgrimage destinations since the medieval period, alongside Jerusalem and Rome. The city claims to hold the remains of Saint James the Greater, one of Jesus's twelve apostles and the first to be martyred. According to tradition, James preached in Hispania before returning to Jerusalem where he was martyred by Herod Agrippa in 44 CE. His disciples brought his body by stone boat to Galicia, where it lay forgotten until 813 CE when hermit Pelayo witnessed mysterious lights over a field—campus stellae, 'field of stars.' King Alfonso II built the first church over the relics in 829 CE. The current Romanesque cathedral (1075-1211) houses the supposed relics and serves as the culmination point for all Camino routes. The pilgrimage experienced remarkable revival since the 1980s, evolving from purely religious practice to embrace secular spiritual seekers, with over 400,000 pilgrims receiving the Compostela certificate in recent Holy Years.",

      "symbolism": "The scallop shell symbolizes the pilgrimage, with grooves representing different Camino routes converging on Santiago. The pilgrim staff represents journey and protection. The Camino itself symbolizes life's spiritual journey toward ultimate destination. Walking mirrors Christian understanding of life as pilgrimage toward heavenly Jerusalem. Physical hardship represents purgation, transformation, and participation in Christ's suffering. The cathedral's Portico of Glory depicts heavenly Jerusalem, positioning Santiago as earthly manifestation of celestial city. Santiago Matamoros (Moor-slayer) iconography reflects Reconquista conflicts, though controversial today. Santiago Peregrino (pilgrim) depicts peaceful journey with staff, gourd, and shell.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Santiago became Christianity's third most important pilgrimage after Jerusalem and Rome, especially after Muslim control made Jerusalem difficult to access. Medieval pilgrims walked to earn indulgences, fulfill vows, or seek healing. The Camino created pan-European cultural exchange, spreading architectural styles, artistic techniques, and ideas. Monasteries, hospitals, and bridges built along routes benefited entire regions. The Order of Santiago (Knights of Saint James) protected pilgrims and fought in Reconquista. Modern revival since 1980s attracts secular seekers alongside religious pilgrims. Paulo Coelho's 'The Pilgrimage' and film 'The Way' sparked global interest. Contemporary Camino creates temporary communities transcending nationality and background. Walking meditation facilitates personal transformation, life transitions, and spiritual awakening."
