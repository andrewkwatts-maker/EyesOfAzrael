  "fullDescription": "The Yellow River (黃河, Huáng Hé) is the second longest river in China and the most sacred waterway in Chinese mythology and history. Known as the 'Mother River' and the cradle of Chinese civilization, it originates from the mythical Kunlun Mountains and flows through the heartland of ancient China. In mythology, the Yellow River is guarded by the River God (Hé Bó) and is associated with cosmic waters, the Yellow Emperor, and the legendary flood-control hero Yu the Great. The river's annual floods were both blessing and curse, inspiring myths of cosmic chaos and order.",

This reflects the cosmic balance of yin and yang, order and chaos. The river's yellow-brown color comes from loess sediment, symbolizing the earth element and the connection between water and land. As the cradle of civilization, it represents the transition from mythical to historical time.",
      "culturalSignificance": "The Yellow River is fundamental to Chinese identity and history. The earliest Chinese civilizations arose along its banks, and it remains a powerful national symbol. The river appears in countless poems, paintings, and myths as both provider and destroyer, reflecting the Chinese philosophical understanding of balance and transformation."
