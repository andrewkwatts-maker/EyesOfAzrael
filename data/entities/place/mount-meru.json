  "fullDescription": "Mount Meru (Sanskrit: मेरु पर्वत) is the sacred five-peaked cosmic mountain at the center of the universe in Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain cosmology. Rising impossibly high from the earth, Meru serves as the axis mundi - the world axis around which all realms revolve. The mountain is described as having four sides made of crystal, ruby, gold, and lapis lazuli, with its peak reaching into the heavens. The city of Brahma sits at its summit, with the gardens of Indra on its slopes. The sun, moon, and stars revolve around Meru, and the celestial Ganges flows down from heaven over its peaks before descending to earth. Seven continents surround Meru, separated by seven oceans. The mountain is also the abode of gods, celestial beings, and great sages.",

      "usage": "Mount Meru is the cosmic axis in Hindu cosmology, the point around which the entire universe revolves. It is the dwelling place of Brahma at its summit and hosts the gardens of Indra (Nandana gardens) on its slopes. The celestial Ganges descends from heaven onto Meru before flowing to earth. The mountain serves as the measuring rod of cosmic distances and time. Seven continents (dvipas) surround Meru, with Jambudvipa (our world) being one of them. The North Star (Dhruva) is said to be directly above Meru.",

        "Ratnasanu (Jewel Peak)",
        "Karnikachala (Lotus Mountain)"
      ],
      "symbolism": "Mount Meru represents the center of spiritual reality, the axis around which all existence revolves. Its position as the cosmic axis makes it the connection point between earth and heaven, the material and spiritual realms. The mountain's four sides of different precious materials represent the four directions and the four yugas (ages). Its impossible height symbolizes the transcendent nature of ultimate reality. Meru also represents the human spine in yogic practice, with the chakras as ascending levels of the mountain, and the crown chakra at its summit.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Mount Meru is fundamental to Hindu cosmological thought and appears extensively in Puranic literature. It influences temple architecture, with temple towers (shikhara or vimana) designed to represent Mount Meru. Mandalas and cosmological diagrams place Meru at their center. The concept has spread throughout South and East Asia, influencing Buddhist and Jain cosmology. While Meru is mythological, various real mountains have been identified with it, including Mount Kailash."
