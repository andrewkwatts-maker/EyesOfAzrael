  "fullDescription": "The Upper Room (Greek: hyperoon; Latin: cenaculum) in Jerusalem is one of the most theologically significant locations in Christian tradition. This large, furnished upper chamber served as the setting for the Last Supper, Jesus' resurrection appearances to the disciples, and the descent of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. For the apostle Thomas, this room holds particular significance as the site of his famous confession: when Jesus appeared and invited Thomas to touch his wounds, Thomas responded with the highest christological confession in the Gospels: 'My Lord and my God' (John 20:28). For the apostle Matthias, this room was equally significant: here the 120 disciples gathered after the Ascension, and here Peter quoted Psalm 109:8 requiring that Judas's vacant office be filled. After prayer, the sacred lot fell upon Matthias, making him the twelfth apostle (Acts 1:15-26). The Upper Room thus witnessed both Thomas's transformation from doubt to the deepest faith, and Matthias's divine selection to restore the apostolic twelve. Fifty days after Easter, the same room witnessed Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit descended as tongues of fire and the apostles - including both Thomas and Matthias - received power for their worldwide mission. The traditional site of the Upper Room is now the Cenacle on Mount Zion, just outside the Old City walls. The current structure dates to Crusader and later periods, though the site has been venerated since at least the 4th century.",
