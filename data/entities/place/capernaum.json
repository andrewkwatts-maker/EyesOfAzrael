  "fullDescription": "Capernaum (Kfar Nahum, 'Village of Nahum') was a prosperous fishing village on the northwestern shore of the Sea of Galilee that became the center of Jesus' Galilean ministry. Located on the Via Maris, the ancient trade route connecting Egypt to Damascus, Capernaum hosted a Roman customs station where tax collectors like Matthew collected duties on goods passing through. It was here that Jesus called Matthew from his tax booth with the simple command 'Follow me' - an invitation that transformed a despised collaborator into a beloved apostle and evangelist. Capernaum witnessed more miracles than any other location in the Gospels: healing of the centurion's servant, Peter's mother-in-law, the paralytic lowered through the roof, the synagogue demoniac, and Jairus's daughter. Jesus taught regularly in its synagogue, whose 4th-century ruins (built on earlier foundations) remain visible today. Despite these mighty works, Capernaum ultimately rejected Jesus, earning his prophetic condemnation: 'And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell' (Matthew 11:23). The village was abandoned by the 7th century CE and rediscovered by archaeologists in the 19th century. Today, a Franciscan church hovers over what tradition identifies as Peter's house, and pilgrims walk the same stones where Matthew heard the call that changed his life.",
