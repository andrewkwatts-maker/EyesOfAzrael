  "fullDescription": "Caesarea Maritima (Caesarea by the Sea), built by Herod the Great between 25-13 BCE, was the magnificent Roman administrative capital of Judea and one of the ancient Mediterranean's most impressive port cities. Named in honor of Caesar Augustus, the city featured an artificial harbor (Sebastos), a theater, hippodrome, palace, and temple to Roma and Augustus. This engineering marvel became the setting for pivotal moments in early Christian history.\n\nThe Book of Acts identifies Caesarea as the home of Philip the Evangelist (one of the Seven Deacons, not to be confused with Philip the Apostle). After evangelizing Samaria and baptizing the Ethiopian eunuch, Philip settled in Caesarea with his four prophesying daughters (Acts 21:8-9). Here Paul stayed with Philip on his final journey to Jerusalem. The city was also home to Cornelius, the Roman centurion whose conversion marked the first Gentile baptism and the pivotal expansion of Christianity beyond Jewish boundaries (Acts 10).\n\nPaul had extensive connections to Caesarea: he landed here after his conversion, was escorted here when Jewish opponents sought his life in Jerusalem, and was imprisoned for two years under Governors Felix and Festus before appealing to Caesar and sailing to Rome (Acts 23-26). His defense before Agrippa II and Festus—'Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian'—occurred in Caesarea's praetorium.\n\nIn later centuries, Caesarea became a center of Christian scholarship. Origen established a theological school and library here (c. 232 CE), and Eusebius, the 'Father of Church History,' served as bishop (c. 314-339 CE), writing his monumental Ecclesiastical History using Origen's library. The city's archaeological remains, including the famous 'Pilate Stone' discovered in 1961, continue to illuminate biblical history.",
