  "fullDescription": "Edessa (modern Sanliurfa, Turkey) was one of the most important early Christian centers in the Near East. According to Syriac tradition preserved in the Doctrine of Addai and recorded by Eusebius, King Abgar V (called Ukkama, 'the Black') sent a letter to Jesus requesting healing from his illness. Jesus sent a reply blessing those who believed without seeing, and promised that after his ascension, a disciple would come to heal and teach. The apostle Thaddaeus (called Addai in Syriac sources) was sent to Edessa, healed King Abgar, and established Christianity there. The legendary 'Image of Edessa' (Greek: Mandylion) - a miraculous image of Christ's face said to have been sent with Thaddaeus's mission or miraculously imprinted on cloth - became one of the most famous icons in Christian history. Edessa became the center of Syriac Christianity and home to the famous 'School of Edessa' which produced seminal theological works. The city later housed what was claimed to be the Mandylion until it was transferred to Constantinople in 944 CE.",
