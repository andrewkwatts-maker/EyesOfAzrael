  "fullDescription": "Mount Olympus is the legendary home of the twelve Olympian gods and the seat of Zeus's throne. Rising as Greece's highest peak at 9,573 feet, Olympus served as both physical mountain and mythical realm—the summit shrouded in clouds represented the boundary between earth and heaven. The gods built magnificent palaces of gold and precious stones on Olympus's peak, gathered in Zeus's great hall for councils and feasts, and descended from the mountain to intervene in mortal affairs. While the physical mountain exists in Thessaly, the mythical Olympus transcended geography as the archetypal divine dwelling—eternal, perfect, and removed from mortal suffering. Only gods and specially favored heroes could ascend to Olympus. The mountain symbolized divine order, cosmic hierarchy, and the axis mundi connecting heaven and earth.",

      "symbolism": "Mount Olympus symbolizes the axis mundi—the cosmic pillar connecting earth to heaven. As the highest point in Greece, it represents the supremacy of the Olympian order over older powers (Titans, primordials). The cloud-wreathed summit symbolizes the veil between mortal and divine realms, the unknowable mystery of godhood. Olympus's permanence and immovability contrast with earthly instability, representing eternal divine order versus temporal mortal chaos. The mountain's inaccessibility to most mortals shows that divinity must be earned or granted, not seized. As gathering place for divine councils, Olympus represents cosmic governance and the principle that even gods submit to order and assembly.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Mount Olympus became synonymous with supreme excellence and divine perfection—'Olympian heights,' 'Olympian gods,' 'Olympian detachment.' The Olympic Games honored Zeus of Olympus and brought pan-Hellenic unity. The mountain remains a powerful national symbol for Greece, appearing on currency and emblems. Modern language retains 'Olympian' to mean god-like excellence or aloof superiority. The concept of gods dwelling on a sacred mountain influenced religious geography across cultures. Olympus inspired countless artistic depictions, from ancient vases to Renaissance paintings to modern fantasy literature."
