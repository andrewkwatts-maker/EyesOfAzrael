  "fullDescription": "The Carnac Stones (French: Alignements de Carnac; Breton: Steudadoù Karnag) constitute one of the most extensive megalithic sites in the world, featuring approximately 3,000 standing stones (menhirs) arranged in complex alignments across the Brittany landscape in northwestern France. Erected between 4500-3300 BCE during the Neolithic period, these monuments predate Stonehenge and the Egyptian pyramids. The site comprises three major stone alignments: Ménec (1,169 stones over 1.2 km), Kermario (1,029 stones over 1 km), and Kerlescan (540 stones over 880 m), along with numerous individual menhirs, dolmens (chamber tombs), tumuli, and stone circles. The stones range from small markers to megaliths over 4 meters tall, arranged in parallel rows that exhibit astronomical and geometric precision. Despite centuries of study, the monuments' original purpose remains enigmatic—theories include astronomical observatory, religious sanctuary, fertility temple, territorial markers, and lunar/solar calendar. Later Celtic and Christian traditions incorporated the stones into local folklore, generating legends of petrified Roman soldiers, Saint Cornelius turning pagan armies to stone, and druidic rituals. The name 'Carnac' possibly derives from Breton 'karn' (stone heap). UNESCO is considering the site for World Heritage designation. The Carnac Stones represent monumental communal effort by prehistoric Atlantic Europe cultures, demonstrating sophisticated social organization, astronomical knowledge, and sacred landscape architecture millennia before written history.",
