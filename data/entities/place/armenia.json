  "fullDescription": "Armenia holds a unique place in Christian history as the first nation to officially adopt Christianity as its state religion in 301 CE under King Tiridates III, through the ministry of Saint Gregory the Illuminator. However, tradition traces the faith's roots much earlier to the apostolic missions of Saints Bartholomew and Thaddeus (Jude), making the Armenian Apostolic Church one of the oldest Christian communities in the world. According to tradition, Bartholomew evangelized Armenia after his mission to India, converting King Polymius and his family. When Polymius's brother Astyages seized power, he ordered Bartholomew flayed alive and beheaded at Albanopolis (modern Bashkale or Derbend). This martyrdom, along with that of Thaddeus at Artaz, established Armenia's apostolic foundation. The Armenian Church treasures relics of both apostles and considers itself founded by their blood witness. The dramatic landscape of Mount Ararat, traditionally the resting place of Noah's Ark, dominates Armenian spiritual geography, symbolizing divine salvation and new beginnings.",

The early adoption of Christianity shaped Armenian national identity inseparably from faith.",
      "culturalSignificance": "The Armenian Apostolic Church is one of the Oriental Orthodox churches, with its own unique liturgy, calendar, and traditions. Armenian Christianity preserved ancient manuscripts lost elsewhere, contributed distinctive church architecture (conical domes), and created an alphabet specifically for Scripture translation. The church sustained Armenian identity through Byzantine, Persian, Arab, Mongol, Ottoman, and Soviet rule, and remains central to diaspora identity after the Genocide."
