  "fullDescription": "Ephesus (Greek: Ephesos) was one of the largest and most important cities of the ancient world, located near present-day Selcuk in western Turkey. Originally a Greek colony, it became a major Roman provincial capital and commercial center. The city was renowned for the Temple of Artemis (Diana), one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. For Christianity, Ephesus holds extraordinary significance. According to tradition, Saint John the Evangelist brought the Virgin Mary here after Christ's ascension, caring for her until her dormition (falling asleep/assumption). John himself spent his final decades ministering in Ephesus, training church leaders including Polycarp of Smyrna, and was eventually buried here. The apostle Paul spent nearly three years in Ephesus, establishing a major church (Acts 19). The Book of Revelation addresses Ephesus first among the Seven Churches of Asia, praising its perseverance while warning it had 'left its first love' (Revelation 2:1-7). The Council of Ephesus (431 CE) declared Mary 'Theotokos' (God-bearer), cementing the city's Marian significance. Today, the ruins of Ephesus attract millions of visitors, and both the traditional site of John's tomb (Basilica of Saint John) and the House of the Virgin Mary remain major pilgrimage destinations.",
