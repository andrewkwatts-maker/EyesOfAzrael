  "fullDescription": "The Duat (dwꜣt) is the ancient Egyptian underworld, a complex realm existing parallel to the mortal world where the dead journey after death and where the sun god Ra travels each night. This mystical realm is neither purely physical nor purely spiritual, but a liminal space filled with challenges, demons, gates, and divine judges. The Duat is ruled by Osiris, who sits in judgment over the deceased. To reach the blessed afterlife (the Field of Reeds), the deceased must successfully navigate the Duat's twelve hours (corresponding to night), pass through guarded gates, recite correct spells, and ultimately face the Weighing of the Heart ceremony where their heart is measured against the feather of Ma'at. The geography of the Duat includes the Lake of Fire, the Hall of Two Truths, serpent-filled caverns, and various regions described in funerary texts.",

Every night, Ra's solar barque traveled through the Duat's twelve hours, battling the serpent Apophis and bringing temporary light to the underworld before emerging reborn at dawn. The deceased pharaohs and nobles were believed to join Ra's journey, helping him fight chaos to ensure the sun's return. Ordinary deceased had their own journey through the Duat, guided by the spells in the Book of the Dead, facing challenges and guardian deities at each gate. The ultimate test occurred in the Hall of Two Truths, where Anubis weighed the heart against Ma'at's feather before Osiris and forty-two divine judges.",

      "symbolism": "The Duat represents the transformative passage from death to rebirth. It embodies the Egyptian belief that death is not an end but a dangerous journey requiring knowledge, virtue, and divine favor. The twelve hours mirror the sun's nightly death and resurrection, teaching that renewal requires passage through darkness. The Hall of Two Truths where judgment occurs represents the Egyptian conviction that the afterlife is earned through righteous living - the heart must be lighter than a feather, unburdened by sin. The Duat's dangers (serpents, demons, lakes of fire) symbolize the soul's confrontation with its own darkness and the cosmic forces of chaos.",
      "culturalSignificance": "The Duat shaped Egyptian funeral practices and the entire mortuary industry. Tombs were equipped with copies of the Book of the Dead and other funerary texts to help the deceased navigate the underworld. Tomb paintings depicted the journey through the Duat and the judgment scene. The concept influenced Egyptian ethics - people strived to live according to Ma'at so their hearts would pass judgment. The Duat's complex mythology influenced later underworld concepts in Greek, Roman, and Abrahamic traditions. Modern scholars see the Duat as one of humanity's most elaborate afterlife cosmologies."
