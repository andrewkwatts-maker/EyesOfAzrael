  "fullDescription": "Persia (modern Iran) holds significant importance in Christian apostolic tradition as the site where Thaddaeus and Simon the Zealot concluded their missionary journeys with martyrdom. After establishing Christianity in Armenia, the two apostles traveled together into Persia, preaching the Gospel in regions under Zoroastrian influence. According to Western tradition preserved in the Golden Legend, they were martyred together around 65-70 CE - Thaddaeus killed by a halberd or axe, and Simon by being sawn in half. The Saint Thaddaeus Monastery (Qara Kelisa) in northwestern Iran, near the Armenian border, marks the traditional site of Thaddaeus's death. Eastern traditions sometimes place their martyrdoms separately, but the Western church celebrates their feast day together on October 28. Persia represented the furthest extent of apostolic mission, beyond the boundaries of the Roman Empire, symbolizing the universal scope of the Gospel commission. Despite centuries of Zoroastrian and later Islamic rule, small Christian communities have persisted in Iran, including Armenian and Assyrian Christians who trace their heritage to apostolic times.",
