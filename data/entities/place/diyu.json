  "fullDescription": "Diyu (地獄, Dìyù, literally 'earth prison') is the Chinese underworld realm where souls are judged, purified, and punished for their earthly deeds before reincarnation. Organized into multiple levels (traditionally ten or eighteen), each governed by a king and specialized for different sins, Diyu combines Buddhist karma concepts with Daoist and folk beliefs. Unlike Western hell, Diyu is not eternal - souls eventually reincarnate after their karmic debt is paid. The realm is presided over by Yanluo Wang (King Yama) and features elaborate tortures, judgment chambers, and the crossing of the Yellow Springs.",

The concept shaped ancestor veneration (rituals to ease ancestors' passage) and Ghost Festival practices. Diyu appears in countless works of literature, opera, and art."
