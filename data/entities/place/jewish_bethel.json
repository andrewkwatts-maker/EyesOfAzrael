  "fullDescription": "Bethel (Hebrew: Beit-El, 'House of God') is one of the most sacred sites in biblical tradition, located approximately 10 miles north of Jerusalem. Originally called Luz, it received its name from the patriarch Jacob after his extraordinary vision of a ladder (sullam) reaching to heaven with angels ascending and descending upon it. Upon waking, Jacob declared: 'How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God (beit El), and this is the gate of heaven' (Genesis 28:17). He set up the stone he had used as a pillow as a pillar, anointed it with oil, and vowed that if God would be with him, YHWH would be his God and this stone would become God's house. Bethel became a major sanctuary in Israelite history, serving as a worship center under Samuel, a location of the Ark of the Covenant, and later one of Jeroboam's two golden calf shrines (alongside Dan). The site embodies the concept of a 'gate of heaven' - a thin place where the boundary between earthly and heavenly realms becomes permeable. When Jesus told Nathanael (Bartholomew) that he would see 'heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man' (John 1:51), he was declaring that he himself is the new Bethel - the true meeting place of heaven and earth, the living 'House of God' and 'Gate of Heaven.'",
