  "shortDescription": "The apostle Thomas's mission field - where Christianity took root in the 1st century, establishing one of the world's oldest Christian communities",
  "fullDescription": "India holds a unique place in Christian history as the destination of the apostle Thomas's mission, traditionally dated to 52 CE. According to the Acts of Thomas and persistent local tradition maintained by the Mar Thoma (St. Thomas) Christians of Kerala, Thomas traveled further east than any other apostle, bringing the Gospel to the Malabar Coast and establishing communities that have maintained continuous existence for nearly two millennia. This makes Indian Christianity older than most European Christianity. The historical plausibility of this tradition is supported by well-documented 1st-century trade routes connecting the Roman Empire with India's western coast, as evidenced by the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. Coins of the Indo-Parthian king Gundaphorus (Gondophares), mentioned in the Acts of Thomas, confirm the text's knowledge of contemporary Indian politics. Whether or not Thomas himself made this journey, the existence of ancient Christian communities in India is undisputed, with the Mar Thoma Christians representing a distinctive Eastern Christianity that developed largely independent of both Rome and Constantinople, preserving Syriac liturgy and traditions while adapting to Indian culture. Thomas's traditional martyrdom at Mylapore (modern Chennai) around 72 CE, and his burial there, established India as the resting place of an apostle - a claim few other nations outside the Mediterranean world can make.",
