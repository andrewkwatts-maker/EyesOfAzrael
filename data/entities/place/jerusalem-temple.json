  "fullDescription": "The Jerusalem Temple was the central sanctuary of ancient Israelite and Jewish worship, built on Mount Moriah where Abraham offered Isaac and where God's presence (Shekhinah) dwelt among Israel. The First Temple, built by King Solomon c. 957 BCE, housed the Ark of the Covenant in the Holy of Holies and was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar in 586 BCE. After the Babylonian Exile, the Second Temple was built c. 516 BCE and later magnificently expanded by Herod the Great. This Second Temple witnessed Jesus' ministry, including his teaching in the Temple courts, his cleansing of the money-changers, and his prophecy of its destruction. According to church tradition, James the Less (or James the Just) was martyred at the Temple pinnacle c. 62 CE, thrown down and beaten with a fuller's club. The Romans destroyed the Second Temple in 70 CE, leaving only the Western Wall. The Temple Mount now holds the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque, sacred to Islam as the site of Muhammad's Night Journey. The Temple remains central to Jewish eschatology, Christian typology (Jesus as the new Temple), and interfaith tensions over sacred space.",
