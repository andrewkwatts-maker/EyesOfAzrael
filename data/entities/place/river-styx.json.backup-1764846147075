  "fullDescription": "The River Styx (Greek: Στύξ, 'Hatred' or 'Detestation') is the principal river of the Underworld, forming the boundary between Earth and the realm of the dead. The goddess Styx personifies the river, and it circles the Underworld seven or nine times. The deceased must cross the Styx via Charon's ferry (paying with a coin placed in the mouth at burial) to reach Hades' kingdom. Most significantly, the Styx is the river by which the gods swear their most binding oaths—breaking such an oath results in severe punishment including temporary loss of divine powers. Achilles was dipped in the Styx by his mother Thetis, making him invulnerable except for his heel. The river's dark waters possess both protective and destructive properties.",
