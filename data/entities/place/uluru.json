  "fullDescription": "Uluru (also known by its colonial name Ayers Rock) is the most sacred site in Australian Aboriginal spirituality and one of the most recognizable natural landmarks on Earth. This massive sandstone monolith rises 348 meters (1,142 feet) above the surrounding plain in the red heart of Australia, with a circumference of 9.4 kilometers (5.8 miles). For the Anangu people, the traditional owners of this land for over 30,000 years, Uluru is not merely a geological formation but a living cultural landscape created during Tjukurpa (the Dreamtime) by ancestral beings. Every feature of Uluru—caves, waterholes, ridges, and markings—tells a story from Tjukurpa, recording the journeys and deeds of ancestral beings like Kuniya the python woman and Liru the poisonous snake men. These are not myths in the Western sense but living law (Tjukurpa) that governs Anangu life, land management, and ceremony to this day.",

      "symbolism": "Uluru represents the tangible manifestation of Tjukurpa—the Dreamtime that is both creation time and eternal present. The rock's features encode creation narratives that serve as living law governing Anangu society. Each cave, waterhole, ridge, and marking tells a story that connects contemporary Anangu to ancestral beings and establishes proper ways of living. The changing colors of Uluru throughout the day represent spiritual transformation and the living nature of Country. As a songline nexus, Uluru connects to pathways across the continent, encoding geographical knowledge, cultural memory, and sacred law in song. The rock symbolizes the Aboriginal understanding that land is not property to be owned, but living relative to whom people belong.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Uluru serves as the spiritual heart of Australia for Aboriginal people and a symbol of Indigenous connection to Country spanning over 60,000 years of continuous culture. The 2019 climbing ban marked a historic moment of recognition and respect for Indigenous sacred sites. The joint management model between Anangu and Parks Australia has become internationally recognized as exemplary Indigenous co-management. Uluru appears in contemporary Aboriginal art, literature, and political movements advocating for Indigenous rights and land justice. For non-Indigenous Australians, Uluru has evolved from colonial exploitation to recognition of its profound spiritual significance. The site challenges Western conceptions of property, wilderness, and sacred space, demonstrating the vitality of living Indigenous traditions."
