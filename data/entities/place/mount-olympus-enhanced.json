  "longDescription": "Mount Olympus is the legendary home of the twelve Olympian gods and the seat of Zeus's throne. Rising as Greece's highest peak at 9,573 feet (2,918 meters), Olympus served as both physical mountain and mythical realm—the summit shrouded in clouds represented the boundary between earth and heaven. The gods built magnificent palaces of gold and precious stones on Olympus's peak, gathered in Zeus's great hall for councils and feasts, and descended from the mountain to intervene in mortal affairs. While the physical mountain exists in Thessaly, the mythical Olympus transcended geography as the archetypal divine dwelling—eternal, perfect, and removed from mortal suffering. Only gods and specially favored heroes could ascend to Olympus. The mountain symbolized divine order, cosmic hierarchy, and the axis mundi connecting heaven and earth.",

As the dwelling of the gods, it represents the vertical axis connecting heaven and earth (axis mundi). Its cloud-shrouded peak symbolizes the boundary between mortal and divine realms. The mountain's physical height mirrors spiritual hierarchy - the higher one climbs, the closer to divinity. Olympus embodies the cosmic mountain found across mythologies: Sumerian ziggurats, Hindu Mount Meru, Norse Asgard, etc. Only the pure and favored may ascend (like heroes granted immortality). The mountain is both real geography and transcendent realm, demonstrating how sacred landscapes exist simultaneously in physical and mythical dimensions."
