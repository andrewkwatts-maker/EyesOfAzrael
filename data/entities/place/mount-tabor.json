  "fullDescription": "Mount Tabor (Hebrew: הר תבור, Har Tavor; Arabic: جبل الطور, Jabal at-Tur) rises 575 meters (1,886 feet) above the Jezreel Valley in Lower Galilee, Israel, its distinctive dome shape visible for miles across the landscape. Christian tradition since at least the 4th century CE has identified this mountain as the site of Jesus Christ's Transfiguration, one of the most profound theophanic events in the New Testament. According to the Gospel accounts (Matthew 17:1-9, Mark 9:2-8, Luke 9:28-36), Jesus took his disciples Peter, James, and John up a high mountain, where he was transfigured before them—his face shining like the sun and his clothes becoming dazzling white. Moses and Elijah appeared alongside Jesus, discussing his approaching death in Jerusalem, and a luminous cloud overshadowed them while God's voice proclaimed, 'This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him.' The mountain's sacred significance, however, predates Christianity. In the Hebrew Bible, Mount Tabor marks the boundary between the tribes of Zebulun, Issachar, and Naphtali (Joshua 19:22), and was the site of Deborah and Barak's victory over Sisera's Canaanite army (Judges 4-5). Psalm 89:12 poetically declares, 'Tabor and Hermon joyously praise your name.' The mountain has been a pilgrimage destination since Byzantine times, with the current Franciscan Church of the Transfiguration (completed 1924) built atop the ruins of Crusader, Byzantine, and earlier structures. The Greek Orthodox Church maintains a separate monastery and chapel on the summit. Each August 6, the Feast of the Transfiguration draws thousands of pilgrims who ascend the winding road or hike the ancient pilgrim paths to commemorate the moment when Jesus's divine nature was revealed, offering his disciples—and through them, all believers—a glimpse of heavenly glory.",

      "symbolism": "The Transfiguration on Mount Tabor represents the supreme theophany of the New Testament—the revelation of Jesus's divine nature while still in human form. The event symbolizes: (1) Jesus as fulfillment of Law (Moses) and Prophets (Elijah); (2) the unity of Old and New Covenants; (3) the promise of resurrection and glorification for all believers; (4) the 'already but not yet' nature of the Kingdom—glory glimpsed but consummation delayed. The shining light (Tabor Light) represents uncreated divine energy, central to Eastern Orthodox theology of theosis (participation in divine nature). Peter's desire to build three tabernacles symbolizes human tendency to preserve momentary spiritual experiences rather than continuing the journey toward the cross. The cloud represents God's presence (Shekinah), echoing Sinai and the Exodus. The event prepares the disciples for Jesus's coming passion by revealing his divine identity.",
      "culturalSignificance": "The Transfiguration has been central to Christian theology, liturgy, and art since early Christianity. The Feast of the Transfiguration (August 6) is celebrated by Catholics, Orthodox, and many Protestant denominations. Eastern Orthodoxy particularly emphasizes the Transfiguration as revealing the possibility of theosis—human participation in divine nature through grace. The event has been depicted by countless artists including Raphael, Fra Angelico, Giovanni Bellini, and Andrei Rublev. Pilgrimage to Mount Tabor has been continuous since Byzantine times, surviving Crusades, Islamic rule, and modern conflicts. The mountain remains a powerful symbol of divine revelation, transformation, and the promise of glorification."

The mountain represents God's intervention in history—not through supernatural miracles but through strategic military positioning and divinely-granted courage.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Mount Tabor holds a place in Jewish historical memory as the site of one of Israel's great military victories during the period of the Judges. Deborah's leadership as prophetess and judge, commanding Barak to action, represents a unique moment of female authority in ancient Israel. The 'Song of Deborah' (Judges 5) is one of the oldest texts in the Hebrew Bible, preserving ancient Hebrew poetry celebrating the triumph. While Mount Tabor is less prominent in Jewish tradition than mountains like Sinai, Zion, or Moriah, it remains part of the sacred geography of the Land of Israel."

The mountain's distinctive dome shape may have influenced its naming. Greek Septuagint renders it as Thabor (Θαβώρ). Latin Vulgate uses Thabor.
