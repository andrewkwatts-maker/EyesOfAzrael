  "fullDescription": "The Burning Bush (Hebrew: הַסְּנֶה הַבֹּעֵר Ha-Sneh Ha-Boer) is the miraculous theophany site on Mount Horeb (Sinai) where God first revealed Himself to Moses. Tending his father-in-law Jethro's sheep, Moses encountered a bush ablaze with divine fire yet unconsumed. From within the flames, God called Moses by name, declared the ground holy, and revealed His personal name—YHWH (I AM WHO I AM). Here God commissioned Moses to return to Egypt and liberate Israel from bondage. The burning-yet-unconsumed bush symbolizes Israel itself: persecuted but indestructible, aflame with divine presence yet not destroyed. This paradoxical image represents the transcendent God dwelling within the material world without consuming it.",

      "usage": "The Burning Bush marks the beginning of Moses' prophetic mission and Israel's redemption from Egypt. It is the site of God's most explicit self-identification ('I AM WHO I AM') and the revelation of the divine name YHWH. The burning bush becomes a symbol of Israel's eternal survival despite persecution and of God's immanent presence within creation.",
      "names": [
        "Ha-Sneh (The Bush)",
        "Ha-Sneh Ha-Boer (The Burning Bush)",
        "Sneh shel Eish (Bush of Fire)"
      ],
      "symbolism": "The burning-yet-unconsumed bush represents multiple theological truths: (1) Israel aflame with suffering yet never destroyed; (2) God's presence dwelling in the material world without consuming or being contained by it; (3) The paradox of divine transcendence and immanence; (4) Prophecy as a fire that illuminates without destroying the prophet. The thornbush itself suggests God's presence can dwell even in lowly, painful circumstances. Moses removing his sandals signifies entering sacred space and approaching God with reverence. The theophany at the bush establishes that the God of the patriarchs is the same God who will redeem Israel.",
      "culturalSignificance": "The Burning Bush is the foundational moment of Israel's national liberation and covenant formation. It demonstrates that God initiates relationship and chooses to intervene in human history. The revelation of the name YHWH provides Israel with the most intimate knowledge of God's nature—His eternal, self-existent being. Jewish mysticism sees the bush as representing the Shekhinah (divine presence) dwelling in lowly places. The tradition identifies the bush as a thorny acacia or bramble, connecting to later use of acacia wood in the Tabernacle. Christian tradition sees the unconsumed bush as prefiguring Mary bearing divinity. Modern St. Catherine's Monastery in Sinai claims to preserve the site."
