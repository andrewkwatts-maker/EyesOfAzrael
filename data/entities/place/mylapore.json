  "fullDescription": "Mylapore, now a neighborhood of Chennai (formerly Madras), holds profound significance in Christian tradition as the site where the apostle Thomas was martyred and buried around 72 CE. According to tradition, Thomas was killed by a spear thrust while praying at Little Mount (Chinnamalai), a small hill where he had retreated for meditation. His body was brought to the coast and buried at what is now San Thome Basilica, built directly over his tomb. The San Thome Basilica is one of only three churches in the world built over the tomb of an apostle - the others being St. Peter's Basilica in Rome and Santiago de Compostela in Spain. The Portuguese rebuilt the basilica in the 16th century after their arrival, and it was reconstructed in neo-Gothic style in 1893. The crypt beneath the main altar contains what tradition identifies as Thomas's tomb. Little Mount, about 8 kilometers away, preserves a cave where Thomas allegedly hid from persecutors, with a small aperture through which he is said to have escaped when discovered. The area also includes St. Thomas Mount (Parangi Malai), a larger hill where Thomas is believed to have been praying when struck by the spear. A bleeding cross allegedly carved by Thomas himself is venerated there. The martyrdom by spear carries profound theological resonance - Thomas, who demanded to see and touch Christ's spear wound, ultimately died by the same instrument, completing his journey from doubt to ultimate witness.",
