  "fullDescription": "Cana of Galilee holds a unique place in Christian tradition as the site of Jesus's first public miracle - the transformation of water into wine at a wedding feast (John 2:1-11). This 'beginning of signs' manifested his glory and led his disciples to believe in him. The village is also identified as the hometown of Nathanael (Bartholomew), the skeptic apostle whom Jesus called 'an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile.' The connection between Cana and Nathanael is explicitly stated in John 21:2. Jesus also healed a royal official's son from Cana (John 4:46-54), making this his second Galilean sign. The site's identification remains debated among scholars, with Kafr Kanna (traditional) and Khirbet Qana (archaeological) as primary candidates. The wedding miracle symbolizes the transformation of Jewish purification rituals (the water jars) into the new wine of the Messianic age, while Nathanael's origin from this village connects the first miracle to the calling of the first disciples.",

      "culturalSignificance": "Cana became an important pilgrimage site, particularly for couples seeking blessing on their marriages. The Wedding Church in Kafr Kanna commemorates the miracle. The transformation narrative has influenced Christian understanding of sacraments, particularly the Eucharist as wine becoming Christ's blood."
