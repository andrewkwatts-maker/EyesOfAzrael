  "fullDescription": "Yomi (黄泉, 'Yellow Springs') or Yomi-no-kuni (黄泉国, 'Land of Yomi') is the underworld in Japanese mythology, a dark realm where the dead dwell. According to the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, Yomi came into prominence when the goddess Izanami died giving birth to the fire god Kagutsuchi. Her husband Izanagi, grief-stricken, journeyed to Yomi to bring her back. He found Izanami in a palace in the underworld, but she had already eaten the food of Yomi, binding her to the realm. When Izanagi lit a fire to see her, he discovered she had become a rotting corpse infested with maggots and thunder deities. Horrified, he fled, pursued by Izanami and the hags of Yomi. He escaped by blocking the exit with a massive boulder (Chibiki-no-iwa), permanently separating the land of the living from the land of the dead. Unlike many underworlds, Yomi is not a place of judgment or punishment but simply the inevitable destination of all who die—a gloomy, shadowy mirror of the living world. It represents kegare (impurity) and pollution, the antithesis of life and purity. Izanami became the ruler of Yomi, vowing to kill 1,000 people daily, while Izanagi promised 1,500 births daily, establishing the cycle of death and life.",

  "mythologyContexts": [
    {
      "mythology": "japanese",
      "usage": "Yomi represents the inevitable destination of the dead in ancient Japanese belief. Unlike Buddhist concepts of judgment and rebirth or Christian ideas of heaven and hell, Yomi is simply where all dead go—a gloomy, unchanging realm. The journey to Yomi establishes the concepts of kegare (death pollution) and the need for harae (purification) in Shinto. Izanagi's purification after escaping Yomi gave birth to Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi, and Susanoo, showing how life and purity emerge from confrontation with death and impurity. The sealing of Yomi creates the permanent boundary between life and death.",
      "names": [
        "Yomi (黄泉) - Yellow Springs",
        "Yomi-no-kuni (黄泉国) - Land of Yomi",
        "Yomotsu-kuni (黄泉津国) - Country of Yomi",
        "Ne-no-kuni (根の国) - Root Country (possibly alternate underworld)"
      ],
      "symbolism": "Yomi represents death, decay, kegare (impurity), and the inevitable end of all living things. The realm is not evil but polluted—a place of natural dissolution and return to formlessness. The food of Yomi (like Persephone's pomegranate) represents the irreversible bond with death. The boulder sealing Yomi symbolizes the permanent separation between living and dead, a boundary that cannot be crossed. The darkness of Yomi contrasts with the light of Takamagahara, representing the dualities of life/death, purity/pollution, light/darkness. The pursuit by hags suggests death's relentless nature. Izanami's transformation from creator to destroyer embodies the cycle of generation and decay.",
      "culturalSignificance": "The Yomi myth establishes fundamental Shinto concepts: the pollution of death (kegare), the necessity of purification (harae), and the separation between sacred purity and profane pollution. Izanagi's purification after escaping Yomi became the prototype for all Shinto purification rituals. The myth explains why death is treated as polluting in Shinto—requiring purification rituals after funerals and avoiding shrines during mourning periods. The sealing of Yomi validates the finality of death in Japanese culture, contrasting with Buddhist concepts of rebirth that later influenced Japanese thought. The story influenced Japanese views on death, mourning, and the afterlife."
