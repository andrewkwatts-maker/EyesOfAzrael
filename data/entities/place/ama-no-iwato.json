  "fullDescription": "Ama-no-Iwato (天岩戸, 'Heavenly Rock Cave') or Ame-no-Iwato is the cave in Takamagahara where the sun goddess Amaterasu hid herself, plunging both heaven and earth into darkness. According to the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, Amaterasu retreated into the cave after her brother Susanoo committed violent acts in her sacred weaving hall, killing one of her attendants. With the sun goddess hidden, darkness covered the world, evil kami emerged, and calamities multiplied. The eight hundred myriad (yaoyorozu) kami gathered outside the cave to devise a plan. They hung the sacred mirror Yata no Kagami and the jewel Yasakani no Magatama on a sakaki tree, performed rituals, and had the goddess Ame-no-Uzume perform a wild, ecstatic dance that made the kami roar with laughter. Curious about the commotion, Amaterasu peeked out, saw her reflection in the mirror, and was pulled fully from the cave by the strong deity Ame-no-Tajikarao. The entrance was sealed with a shimenawa rope to prevent her return. This myth establishes many Shinto ritual practices and explains the origin of sacred objects.",

    {
      "mythology": "japanese",
      "usage": "The Ama-no-Iwato myth is one of the most important in Shinto, establishing the origins of sacred objects (mirror, jewel, sakaki) and ritual practices (kagura dance, shimenawa rope). The story explains seasonal darkness and light, the power of ritual to restore cosmic order, and the communal effort required to solve crises. The myth validates the sacred objects of the Imperial Regalia and the ritual practices of Shinto.",
      "names": [
        "Ama-no-Iwato (天岩戸) - Heavenly Rock Cave",
        "Ame-no-Iwato (天の岩戸) - Cave of Heaven",
        "Ama-no-Iwaya (天岩屋) - Heavenly Rock House"
      ],
      "symbolism": "The cave represents withdrawal, depression, and the absence of divine light. Amaterasu's retreat symbolizes trauma and the need for healing. The gathering of kami represents communal response to crisis. Ame-no-Uzume's dance symbolizes the power of joy, laughter, and art to transform darkness. The mirror represents self-recognition and truth. The pulling out represents the community's role in healing. The shimenawa sealing prevents regression, marking the permanent return to light.",
      "culturalSignificance": "The myth establishes fundamental Shinto practices still observed today. Kagura (sacred dance) derives from Ame-no-Uzume's performance. Shimenawa ropes mark sacred boundaries throughout Japan. The mirror and jewel became Imperial Regalia. The story influenced Japanese theater, particularly comedic and dance traditions. Several physical locations in Japan claim to be the earthly site of the mythical cave, particularly in Miyazaki Prefecture."
