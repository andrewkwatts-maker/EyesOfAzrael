  "fullDescription": "Mount Kailash (Sanskrit: कैलास पर्वत Kailāsa) is a 6,638-meter peak in the Himalayas of Tibet, considered the earthly manifestation of the cosmic Mount Meru and the eternal abode of Lord Shiva and his consort Parvati. This distinctive pyramid-shaped mountain is one of the most sacred sites in the world, revered by Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and Bon practitioners. For Hindus, Kailash is where Shiva sits in eternal meditation, and it is the source of four great rivers (Indus, Brahmaputra, Sutlej, and Karnali). The mountain has never been climbed out of respect for its sanctity. Pilgrims perform the kora (circumambulation) around the mountain, a 52-kilometer trek at high altitude considered to absolve sins and bring spiritual merit.",

      "symbolism": "Mount Kailash represents the union of heaven and earth, the dwelling place where the infinite (Shiva) meets the finite (material world). Its pyramid shape symbolizes the upward movement of spiritual aspiration and the descent of divine grace. The mountain's four faces oriented to the cardinal directions represent Shiva's omnipresence and the four Vedas. The glaciers and rivers flowing from Kailash symbolize the flow of divine wisdom and grace to the world. In yogic tradition, Kailash represents the Sahasrara (crown chakra), the seat of supreme consciousness.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Mount Kailash is one of the most important pilgrimage sites in Asia, sacred to over a billion people of four major religions. The mountain has never been climbed and climbing it is prohibited by Chinese and Tibetan authorities out of respect for its sanctity. The kora (circumambulation) around Kailash is considered one of the most spiritually powerful pilgrimages. The journey is extremely difficult due to high altitude and harsh conditions, yet thousands undertake it annually. Kailash features prominently in Hindu art, literature, and spiritual practice."
