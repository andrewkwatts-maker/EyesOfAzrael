  "fullDescription": "Patmos is a small Greek island in the southeastern Aegean Sea, one of the northernmost islands of the Dodecanese complex. This rocky, volcanic island, measuring only about 34 square kilometers, achieved eternal significance when Saint John the Evangelist was exiled here during the reign of Emperor Domitian (c. 95 CE). In a cave on the island, John received the extraordinary visions that became the Book of Revelation, Christianity's definitive apocalyptic text. The island is mentioned directly in Revelation 1:9: 'I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation...was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.' According to tradition, John dictated his visions to his disciple Prochorus in what is now called the Cave of the Apocalypse (Grotto of the Revelation). The Byzantine Monastery of Saint John the Theologian, founded in 1088 by Saint Christodoulos, crowns the island's highest point and houses important manuscripts and relics. UNESCO designated the historic center of Patmos, including the Monastery and Cave, as a World Heritage Site in 1999. The island remains a major pilgrimage destination for Christians worldwide, who come to venerate the site where the final book of the Bible was revealed.",

The island's identity is inseparable from John's revelation, with religious tourism forming a major part of its economy. The Cave and Monastery preserve the memory of the apocalyptic encounter. Patmos represents Christian hope that God speaks through human suffering and that exile cannot silence divine communication."
