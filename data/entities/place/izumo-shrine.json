  "fullDescription": "Izumo Taisha (出雲大社, 'Grand Shrine of Izumo'), also known as Izumo Oyashiro, is one of Japan's oldest and most important Shinto shrines, dedicated to Okuninushi-no-Kami, the deity who relinquished rulership of the earthly realm to Ninigi. According to mythology, when Okuninushi ceded control of the visible world (utsushiyo) to the heavenly kami, he retained authority over the hidden world (kakuriyo) and matters of fate, relationships, and marriage. In exchange, a grand palace/shrine was built for him at Izumo. The shrine is famous for its massive shimenawa (sacred rope) weighing over 5 tons and its unique architectural style. During the tenth lunar month (Kannazuki, 'month without gods,' elsewhere in Japan), all eight million kami are said to gather at Izumo for their annual assembly, making it Kamiarizuki ('month with gods') there. The shrine is especially associated with matchmaking and relationships, as Okuninushi arranges the spiritual bonds between people.",

      "usage": "Izumo Taisha represents the reconciliation between earthly and heavenly authority. Okuninushi's residence there symbolizes his continued spiritual authority even after political cession. The shrine is the center for prayers concerning relationships, marriage, and en-musubi (spiritual bonds). During Kamiarizuki, pilgrims visit believing their fates are being decided by the assembled kami.",

        "Kizuki no Oyashiro (杵築大社) - Former name"
      ],
      "symbolism": "Izumo represents the earthly, hidden aspects of existence (kakuriyo) versus the visible world. The shrine symbolizes relationships, fate, and the unseen threads connecting people. The massive shimenawa represents the strength of bonds and the boundary between worlds. The unique architecture (Taisha-zukuri style) predates Buddhist influence, preserving ancient Japanese building traditions.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Izumo is second only to Ise in spiritual importance. The shrine attracts millions seeking blessings for relationships and marriage. The Kamiarizuki festival draws huge crowds. The shrine preserves the Taisha-zukuri architectural style, the oldest shrine style in Japan. Izumo's mythology preserves pre-Imperial religious traditions, offering an alternative narrative to Yamato (Imperial) mythology."
