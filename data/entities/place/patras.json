  "fullDescription": "Patras (Greek: Patrai) is an ancient city in the Peloponnese region of Greece, venerated in Christian tradition as the site of Saint Andrew the Apostle's martyrdom. According to tradition, Andrew preached extensively in Greece and established the church at Patras. The Roman proconsul Aegeas (or Aegeates) ordered Andrew's crucifixion around 60 CE after Andrew converted Aegeas's wife Maximilla and refused to sacrifice to pagan gods. Andrew reportedly requested to be crucified on an X-shaped cross (crux decussata), feeling unworthy to die on the same shape of cross as his Lord Jesus Christ. He preached from the cross for two days before dying, continuing to bring souls to Christ even in his final hours. His relics were initially buried in Patras before being transferred to Constantinople in 357 CE. The skull was taken to Rome in 1462 to protect it from Ottoman conquest but was returned to Patras by Pope Paul VI in 1964 as an ecumenical gesture to the Greek Orthodox Church. Today, the Cathedral of Saint Andrew (the largest church in Greece) houses the returned relics and the cross on which Andrew was supposedly martyred. Patras remains a major pilgrimage destination, especially on Saint Andrew's feast day (November 30), when Orthodox Christians worldwide honor the Protokletos (First-Called) apostle.",

The X-shaped cross became the defining symbol of humility and differentiation from Christ's crucifixion. Andrew's choice of a different cross form represents Christian humility and unworthiness before Christ. His continued preaching from the cross for two days symbolizes the power of witness even in suffering and death. The return of relics from Rome to Patras in 1964 symbolizes Orthodox-Catholic ecumenical dialogue and healing of the 1054 schism.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Patras is central to Greek Orthodox identity and to nations claiming Andrew as patron (Russia, Scotland, Romania, Ukraine). The Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople traces its founding to Andrew, making Patras the origin point of Eastern Christianity's apostolic succession. November 30 feast day draws pilgrims worldwide. The modern cathedral (completed 1974) is the largest Orthodox church in Greece and houses the returned relics. The city celebrates with processions, liturgies, and civic festivities. Andrew's patronage of Scotland (which claims some of his relics) creates cultural ties between Greece and Scotland, symbolized by sharing the saltire flag motif."
