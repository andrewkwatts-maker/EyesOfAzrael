  "fullDescription": "Mount Sinai (Hebrew: הַר סִינַי Har Sinai), also known as Mount Horeb (חֹרֵב Chorev), is the most sacred mountain in Jewish tradition—the site of direct divine revelation to the entire nation of Israel. Here, God descended in fire and smoke, the mountain trembled, and the voice of God proclaimed the Ten Commandments to all assembled Israel. Moses ascended the mountain multiple times, spending forty days and nights in God's presence to receive the complete Torah—both written and oral. Sinai represents the meeting point of heaven and earth, where God's transcendence touched human history, establishing the eternal covenant between God and Israel. Its exact location remains unknown, adding to its mystical significance.",

      "usage": "Mount Sinai is the locus of revelation, where the written and oral Torah were given to Moses and where Israel entered into eternal covenant with God. It represents the tangible point of contact between the divine and human realms. The mountain's name may derive from the thorn bushes (seneh) growing there, or from the Babylonian moon god Sin, indicating the mountain's ancient sanctity.",
      "names": [
        "Har Sinai (Mount Sinai)",
        "Har Horeb (Mount Horeb - 'Mountain of Desolation/Dryness')",
        "Har Ha-Elohim (Mountain of God)",
        "Jebel Musa (Arabic: 'Mountain of Moses')"
      ],
      "symbolism": "Sinai represents the foundation of Jewish identity—the moment when Israel became God's covenant people through the gift of Torah. The mountain symbolizes the meeting of heaven and earth, transcendence touching immanence. In Kabbalah, Sinai corresponds to Malkhut receiving from Tiferet, representing the created world receiving divine revelation. The mountain's shaking and fire represent the awesome power of divine presence. The fact that no one could touch the mountain during the theophany emphasizes God's holiness and otherness. The subsequent entry of priests and seventy elders onto the mountain shows how covenant creates access to the divine.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Sinai is the birthplace of Judaism as a covenantal religion. The festival of Shavuot commemorates the giving of the Torah at Sinai. Jewish tradition teaches that every Jewish soul—past, present, and future—was present at Sinai, making each Jew a direct recipient of revelation. The phrase 'to stand at Sinai' means to accept the Torah's authority. Mystics seek to recreate the Sinai experience through intense Torah study and meditation. The exact location's hiddenness suggests that revelation is not tied to geography but to spiritual readiness. Modern archaeological candidates include Jebel Musa in the southern Sinai Peninsula, though other locations have been proposed."
