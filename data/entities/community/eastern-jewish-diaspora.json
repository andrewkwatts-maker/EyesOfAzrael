  "shortDescription": "Ancient Jewish communities of India and the East - connecting Thomas' mission to existing Jewish diaspora",
  "fullDescription": "The Eastern Jewish Diaspora represents ancient Jewish communities established far beyond the Mediterranean world, reaching India centuries before the Common Era. The Cochin Jews (Malabar Jews) trace their origins to King Solomon's time, when Jewish merchants arrived via the spice trade routes (1 Kings 10:22). The Bene Israel of the Konkan coast claim descent from Jews shipwrecked around 175 BCE. The Baghdadi Jews of Mumbai arrived later from the Middle East. These communities preserved Jewish identity, Hebrew scripture, and Torah observance for millennia in isolation from European Jewry. When Thomas the Apostle arrived in India around 52 CE, he did not enter a land unknown to Jewish tradition. Jewish trading communities had established themselves in Kerala for centuries. The ancient Kerala Jewish copper plates (Sasanam) granted in 379 CE formalized rights that presupposed long-standing Jewish presence. Thomas' mission to India followed ancient Jewish trade routes and found existing Jewish communities. His evangelism among both Jews and Gentiles in India connects to the pattern established by Paul: 'to the Jew first, and also to the Greek' (Romans 1:16). The Mar Thoma Christians preserve traditions of Thomas' engagement with these Jewish communities.",
