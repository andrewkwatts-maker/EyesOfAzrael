  "fullDescription": "The Three-Headed Hound of Hades\n\nMonstrous guardian of the gates of the Underworld, Cerberus stands as the eternal threshold guardian between the realms of the living and the dead. With his fearsome appearance and unwavering vigilance, he ensures that no living soul may enter unbidden, and no shade of the dead may ever escape back to the world above.\n\nCerberus has stood sentinel at the gates of the underworld since time immemorial, serving faithfully under Hades and Persephone. Only a handful of heroes and mortals have ever passed him, and fewer still by force.",
