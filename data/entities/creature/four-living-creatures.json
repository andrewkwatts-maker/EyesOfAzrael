  "fullDescription": "The Four Living Creatures (Greek: zoa, Hebrew: chayot) are extraordinary angelic beings described in the visions of Ezekiel (chapters 1 and 10) and John's Revelation (chapter 4). In John's apocalyptic vision on Patmos, these creatures surround the throne of God, each having six wings and covered with eyes all around and within. The first has the face of a lion, the second of an ox (or calf), the third of a man, and the fourth of a flying eagle. Day and night they never cease to cry: 'Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come!' (Revelation 4:8). In Ezekiel's earlier vision, each creature has four faces (all four together) and four wings, forming the living chariot (Merkabah) that carries God's throne. Christian tradition identified these four faces with the four Evangelists: Matthew (man/angel), Mark (lion), Luke (ox), and John himself (eagle) - John's symbol representing the soaring theological heights of his Gospel. In Jewish mystical tradition (Merkabah mysticism), the Chayot are the highest angelic order, bearing the divine throne. The Four Living Creatures represent all of animated creation worshipping God: the lion (wild animals), ox (domestic animals), human (humanity), and eagle (birds), with their ceaseless worship emphasizing God's absolute holiness and eternal nature.",
