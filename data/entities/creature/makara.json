  "fullDescription": "Makara (Sanskrit: मकर, Makara) is a legendary sea creature in Hindu and Buddhist mythology, typically depicted as a composite animal with the front half of various creatures (elephant, crocodile, deer, or fish) and the rear half of a fish or dolphin. The most common depiction shows a creature with an elephant-like trunk, crocodilian jaws filled with sharp teeth, the body of a fish with scales, and sometimes deer-like ears or horns. Makara serves as the vahana (mount) of the river goddess Ganga and the sea god Varuna, representing mastery over aquatic realms. In astrology, Makara corresponds to Capricorn, the tenth sign of the zodiac. Makaras are guardians of gateways and thresholds, commonly depicted on temple entrances, gates (toranas), and as decorative elements spewing forth vegetation or water. The creature represents the life-giving and destructive powers of water—fertility, creation, abundance, but also danger and the primordial chaos of the deep. Makara appears throughout Hindu iconography, from temple architecture to ritual objects, symbolizing the threshold between land and water, known and unknown, material and spiritual realms.",

      "symbolism": "Makara symbolizes the primordial creative power of water—both life-giving (fertility, abundance) and destructive (floods, drowning). Its composite form represents the fusion of multiple animal powers: elephant's strength and wisdom, crocodile's ferocity, fish's fertility and fluidity. As threshold guardian, Makara protects boundaries between realms—land and water, sacred and profane, known and unknown. The creature emerging from temple archways represents abundance flowing from the divine source. Makara's connection to both Varuna (cosmic ocean) and Ganga (sacred river) links celestial and terrestrial waters. The creature represents transformation and adaptability, able to navigate water (unconscious, emotions, chaos) that would destroy others. Its role in Makar Sankranti marks the sun's transition, representing cosmic changes and auspicious beginnings.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Makara appears throughout Indian and Southeast Asian art and architecture, particularly on temple gateways (torana), where its open mouth serves as the entry point. The creature became a ubiquitous decorative motif representing protection and abundance. Makar Sankranti, celebrating the sun's entry into Makara (Capricorn), is one of the few Hindu festivals based on solar calendar, marking winter's end. Makara earrings (kundala) are worn by Krishna and other deities. In South Indian temples, makara toranas are elaborate architectural features. The creature influenced Southeast Asian temple art, appearing in Khmer, Thai, and Javanese architecture. Makara represents mastery over the unconscious and chaotic forces represented by water."
