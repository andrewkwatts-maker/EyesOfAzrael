  "shortDescription": "The slain yet standing Lamb with seven horns and seven eyes in John's throne room vision - Christ as sacrificial redeemer and all-powerful, all-seeing Lord.",
  "fullDescription": "The Lamb with Seven Eyes (Greek: arnion) is one of the most profound Christological images in the Book of Revelation. In John's vision of the heavenly throne room (Revelation 5), a sealed scroll appears in God's right hand, and the question arises: 'Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?' John weeps when no one is found worthy, until an elder announces: 'Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah...hath prevailed to open the book.' But when John looks, he sees not a lion but 'a Lamb as it had been slain' - standing, alive, yet bearing the marks of sacrificial death. This Lamb has seven horns (complete power) and seven eyes 'which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth' (complete knowledge/omniscience). When the Lamb takes the scroll, all heaven erupts in worship: 'Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing!' This stunning image transforms power: the slain Lamb, not a conquering lion, is the key to history. The Lamb opens the seven seals, receives worship alongside God, and appears as bridegroom in the marriage supper. At the final battle, the Lamb conquers as 'Lord of lords and King of kings.' The paradox of a slaughtered victim reigning supreme captures the heart of Christian theology: victory through sacrifice, power through weakness, life through death.",

The Lamb receives the worship due only to God, affirming Christ's divinity. This image shaped Christian art, liturgy, and theology profoundly.",

Seven horns reverse the lamb's natural weakness - this Lamb has complete power. Seven eyes representing the Spirit mean this Lamb sees and knows all. The unexpected transformation from Lion to Lamb teaches that God's power works through apparent weakness. The Lamb's worthiness to open the scroll reveals that sacrificial love unlocks history's meaning.",
      "culturalSignificance": "The Lamb image pervades Christian art: the Agnus Dei appears in altarpieces, liturgy, and heraldry. The Lamb with banner or flag represents the resurrection. 'Lamb of God' (Agnus Dei) is sung in Catholic Mass and many Protestant liturgies. The image shaped Christology, emphasizing Christ's sacrificial death as the source of His authority. It provides comfort to persecuted Christians - they too conquer by following the Lamb's way of faithful suffering."
