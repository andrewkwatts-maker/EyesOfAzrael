  "shortDescription": "The seven-headed, ten-horned beast rising from the sea in Revelation 13, representing blasphemous political power empowered by the Dragon to persecute the saints.",
  "fullDescription": "The Beast from the Sea is one of the most terrifying figures in John's apocalyptic vision, described in Revelation 13:1-10 as rising from the sea with seven heads, ten horns, and ten crowns. This composite creature has a body like a leopard, feet like a bear, and a mouth like a lion - combining features from Daniel's four beasts into one horrifying entity. The Dragon (Satan) gives this Beast 'his power, and his seat, and great authority.' One of its heads appears mortally wounded but miraculously heals, causing the world to marvel and worship both the Beast and the Dragon who empowers it. For forty-two months, the Beast blasphemes God and makes war against the saints, conquering them. 'All that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life.' The Beast is traditionally interpreted as representing persecuting political empires (Rome for John's original audience, or totalitarian governments throughout history) that claim divine authority and demand absolute allegiance. With the Dragon and the False Prophet (Beast from the Earth), it forms an unholy trinity opposing God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit. The Beast's number, 666, represents the perfection of imperfection - humanity claiming divine status but falling short.",

      "symbolism": "The Beast embodies political power claiming divine authority. Rising from the sea connects to ancient chaos-monster imagery (Leviathan, Rahab) and represents the gentile nations. Seven heads may represent seven Roman emperors or seven hills of Rome. Ten horns with crowns represent complete political power. The mortal wound healed parodies Christ's resurrection, suggesting a false messiah or revived empire. Forty-two months (3.5 years) echoes Daniel's period of persecution.",
      "culturalSignificance": "The Beast image has shaped Christian political theology for two millennia. Various regimes have been identified as the Beast: Roman Empire, papal Rome, Napoleon, Hitler, Soviet Union, modern superpowers. 666 remains a potent symbol of evil. The imagery warns Christians against giving ultimate allegiance to any human institution. It comforts persecuted believers that all earthly powers are temporary and will face divine judgment."
