  "fullDescription": "Garuda (Sanskrit: गरुड, Garuḍa) is the king of birds and the vahana (mount) of Lord Vishnu in Hindu and Buddhist mythology. Born from an egg to the sage Kashyapa and Vinata, Garuda emerged fully grown, blazing with the radiance of fire, so bright that the gods mistook him for Agni, the fire god. He is depicted as a magnificent being with the body of a strong man, the golden wings, beak, and talons of an eagle, and a white face with a sharp eagle's beak. Garuda's most famous exploit was stealing amrita (the nectar of immortality) from the gods to free his mother from slavery to his aunt Kadru, mother of the serpents (nagas). Though he successfully retrieved the amrita, Vishnu intercepted him and, impressed by Garuda's power and devotion, made him his eternal mount. Garuda became the sworn enemy of all nagas (serpents), preying upon them and representing the eternal conflict between birds and serpents, good and evil, light and darkness. He symbolizes birth, heaven, divine protection, solar energy, and the soul's journey to liberation. Garuda appears on the royal seal of Thailand and Indonesia, demonstrating his cultural importance across South and Southeast Asia.",

      "symbolism": "Garuda represents the solar principle—birth, radiance, power, and ascent. His golden wings symbolize divine light and spiritual elevation. As Vishnu's mount, he represents the vehicle of divine consciousness, carrying the preserver god across the cosmos. The eagle form connects to sky, wind, and the ability to see with clarity from great heights—spiritual perspective. His enmity with serpents (nagas) symbolizes the eternal conflict between light and darkness, spirit and matter, heaven and earth. Stealing amrita to free his mother represents liberation through spiritual power and filial devotion. His speed represents swiftness in overcoming obstacles and reaching enlightenment. The man-bird form shows the fusion of human consciousness with divine freedom of flight.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Garuda became one of Hinduism's most important divine figures, appearing in temple architecture throughout South and Southeast Asia. He serves as the national emblem of Indonesia and Thailand, demonstrating his pan-Asian significance. In Thai Buddhism, Garuda (Krut) battles with nagas in temple art. Vishnu temples feature Garuda prominently, with devotees believing Garuda worship protects against snake bites and poison. The Garuda Purana, supposedly narrated by Garuda, is recited during Hindu funeral rites. Garuda's image wards off evil and poison. His story emphasizes loyalty, devotion, and the power to overcome impossible obstacles through determination."
