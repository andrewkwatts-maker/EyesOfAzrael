  "shortDescription": "Divine messengers who ascend and descend between heaven and earth; central to Jacob's Bethel vision and Jesus's promise to Nathanael",
  "fullDescription": "Malakhim (Hebrew: plural of mal'akh, 'messenger') are the angelic beings of Jewish tradition who serve as intermediaries between God and humanity. The word mal'akh derives from a root meaning 'to send,' emphasizing their role as divine envoys. In Jewish thought, angels are created beings of pure spirit who execute God's will in the cosmos. Jacob's vision at Bethel of angels 'ascending and descending' on the ladder (Genesis 28:12) reveals their constant ministry between heaven and earth. This vision became foundational for Jewish angelology and was directly referenced by Jesus when he told Nathanael (Bartholomew): 'You shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man' (John 1:51). The major archangels in Jewish tradition include Michael (Israel's protector, prince of angels), Gabriel (God's strength, messenger of important revelations), Raphael (God's healing, guide and healer), and Uriel (God's light, associated with wisdom). The mysterious 'Angel of the LORD' (Malakh YHWH) appears throughout the Hebrew Bible in theophanies where the distinction between the angel and God himself becomes blurred. Merkabah mysticism developed elaborate angelic hierarchies based on Ezekiel's throne-chariot vision, with ranks including seraphim, cherubim, ophanim, and various orders of heavenly beings. In Jewish tradition, angels have no free will and cannot sin - they are pure expressions of divine purpose. Each Jew is traditionally believed to be accompanied by guardian angels, and angels are said to carry prayers to God's throne.",
