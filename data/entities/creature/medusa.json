  "fullDescription": "Medusa was the most famous of the three Gorgon sisters, cursed with a monstrous form and the power to turn anyone who looked upon her face to stone. Once a beautiful mortal maiden, she was transformed into a terrifying creature with living venomous snakes for hair, bronze hands, golden wings, and a gaze that brought instant petrification. Her story explores themes of victimization, monstrosity, feminine power, and the hero's journey.\n\nAccording to Ovid's Metamorphoses, Medusa was originally a beautiful maiden, a priestess in Athena's temple. Poseidon, god of the sea, desired her and violated her within Athena's sacred temple. Enraged by this desecration, Athena punished Medusa by transforming her lovely hair into serpents and making her face so hideous that anyone who gazed upon it would turn to stone.\n\nThis origin story transforms Medusa from a simple monster into a victim twice over - first of Poseidon's assault, then of Athena's misplaced anger. Some modern interpretations view her transformation as both curse and protection, giving her the power to destroy those who would harm her.",
