  "fullDescription": "Pegasus (Greek: Πήγασος) is the legendary winged horse of Greek mythology, born from the blood of Medusa when Perseus severed her head. Along with his brother Chrysaor, Pegasus sprang fully formed from the Gorgon's neck, fathered by Poseidon during his union with Medusa before her transformation. The name Pegasus likely derives from 'pegai' (springs or waters), connecting the horse to his father Poseidon's aquatic domain. Pegasus first dwelt on Mount Helicon, home of the Muses, where his hoofstrike created the Hippocrene spring ('horse fountain'), a source of poetic inspiration. The hero Bellerophon, aided by Athena who provided a golden bridle, tamed Pegasus and rode him to accomplish great deeds including the slaying of the Chimera. When Bellerophon attempted to fly to Mount Olympus in an act of hubris, Zeus sent a gadfly to sting Pegasus, causing the horse to buck and throw his rider. Pegasus continued to Olympus alone, where he became the faithful servant of Zeus, carrying his thunderbolts. Eventually, Zeus honored Pegasus by transforming him into a constellation. Pegasus represents divine inspiration, poetic flight, the bridge between earth and heaven, and the supernatural aid that assists heroes in impossible tasks.",

As a winged horse, he bridges earthly strength with heavenly flight, representing the soul's ascent and spiritual elevation. Born from Medusa's blood, beauty emerges from horror—the monster's death births transcendent grace. Pegasus represents supernatural aid in heroic quests, the divine gift that enables impossible achievements. His service carrying Zeus's thunderbolts symbolizes inspiration channeling divine power. His constellation form represents immortalization through excellence. The white color symbolizes purity and divine nature.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Pegasus became the ultimate symbol of poetic inspiration and artistic genius. The Hippocrene spring on Helicon was sacred to poets seeking the Muses' favor. Pegasus appears as a constellation (one of Ptolemy's 48), connecting mortal heroism to eternal stellar immortality. The winged horse became a widespread symbol in heraldry representing eloquence, poetry, and fame. Modern usage includes company logos (Mobil Oil's flying horse) and cultural metaphors for inspiration. Pegasus represents the artist's power to transcend earthly limitations through creative vision. The image of a hero riding Pegasus became iconic in Western art and literature."
