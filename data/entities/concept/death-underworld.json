  "fullDescription": "The Death & Underworld Deity archetype represents one of humanity's most profound and universal religious responses—the personification of mortality, the afterlife, and the transition from life to death. These deities serve as sovereign rulers of the underworld realm, judges who weigh souls and determine fates, psychopomps who guide the deceased, and guardians of the boundary between life and death. Unlike mere personifications of death (Thanatos, Mors), these are complex theological figures who maintain cosmic balance by ensuring mortality, prevent hubris through the finality they represent, and often promise transformation or resurrection rather than mere annihilation. The Death God rarely represents pure evil or destruction—instead, death is understood as necessary transition, cosmic law, and even justice. Across cultures, Death deities share striking similarities: they rule hierarchical underworld realms, judge souls based on earthly deeds, demand respect while inspiring fear, and embody the inescapable truth that all living things must eventually face them. This archetype serves the essential cultural function of memento mori—remember you must die—providing moral structure, humility, urgency to live meaningfully, and acceptance of life's limits.",
