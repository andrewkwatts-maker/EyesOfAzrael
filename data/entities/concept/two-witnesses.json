  "shortDescription": "Jewish legal requirement for establishing truth through multiple witnesses - Thomas as essential resurrection witness",
  "fullDescription": "The Two Witnesses principle (Hebrew: עֵדוּת, edut) is a foundational concept in Jewish law establishing that no capital charge or major legal matter may be decided on the testimony of a single witness. Deuteronomy 19:15 declares: 'One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity... at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.' This requirement reflects Jewish epistemology: truth is established through corroboration, not merely assertion. The principle explains Thomas' theological significance in the resurrection narrative. His initial absence and subsequent demand for evidence made him the crucial second witness. The other disciples saw Jesus on one occasion; Thomas' separate encounter eight days later provided the essential corroborating testimony. His demand 'Except I shall see... I will not believe' (John 20:25) is not faithlessness but legal and epistemological rigor. Thomas became the indispensable witness whose testimony established the resurrection 'at the mouth of two' - the collective eleven, and Thomas separately. Early Christian preaching emphasized multiple witnesses to the resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:5-8), directly applying this Jewish legal principle.",

Witnesses must be examined separately (hakirah and bedikah), their testimony must agree on essential details, and false witnesses receive the punishment they sought to inflict on the accused. The Sanhedrin required two witnesses even for capital punishment."

      "mythology": "christian",
      "description": "The New Testament repeatedly invokes the two-witness principle. Jesus sent disciples in pairs. He declared 'where two or three are gathered' (Matthew 18:19-20). Paul appeals to 'two or three witnesses' (2 Corinthians 13:1). Thomas provides the essential second-wave witness to the resurrection, his separate encounter corroborating the disciples' earlier testimony."

      "symbolism": "Two witnesses represent complementary perspectives that together establish truth.

This reflects Jewish epistemological humility - we cannot know truth from a single source but need corroboration.",
      "culturalSignificance": "The witness requirement has shaped Jewish communal life, legal proceedings, and religious practice. Documents require two witnesses. Marriage and divorce require witnesses. The new moon was established by two witnesses appearing before the Sanhedrin. This emphasis on verified testimony distinguishes Jewish law from systems based on confession or divine ordeal."

  "thomasConnection": {
    "significance": "Thomas' role as 'Doubting Thomas' is better understood through Jewish witness law. His absence at the first resurrection appearance and his demand for personal verification made him the essential second witness. The eleven saw Jesus once; Thomas' separate encounter eight days later provided corroboration.",
    "epistemology": "Thomas demanded the same standard of evidence Jewish law required for capital matters. Since the resurrection was a matter of ultimate significance - indeed, 'life and death' in the deepest sense - his demand for tangible proof reflected proper Jewish legal procedure, not faithless skepticism.",
    "theologicalRole": "Without Thomas' separate witness, the resurrection could be dismissed as collective hallucination or groupthink. His initial doubt and subsequent conviction provide the second testimony that establishes the matter. Jesus accommodated Thomas' need for evidence, validating the Jewish principle that truth requires verification.",
    "earlyChurchPreaching": "1 Corinthians 15:5-8 lists resurrection appearances in a manner reflecting witness-list format: 'He was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve... after that of above five hundred brethren at once... after that of James... last of all he was seen of me also.' Paul understood that multiple witnesses established the resurrection's historicity."
