  "fullDescription": "Ki (気), known as Qi or Chi in Chinese, is the fundamental life energy or vital force that flows through all living things and the universe itself. In Japanese culture, ki is the animating essence that distinguishes living from non-living, the breath that gives life, and the spiritual energy that connects all beings. The concept was imported from Chinese philosophy (Daoism, traditional medicine) but integrated deeply into Japanese martial arts, healing practices, and spiritual traditions. Ki flows through the body via meridians, and health depends on its balanced circulation. Martial artists cultivate and direct ki for power and technique (as in Aikido, 'the way of harmonizing ki'). Healers work to restore disrupted ki flow. The concept relates to, but is distinct from, kami—while kami are discrete spiritual beings, ki is the universal energy they embody and channel. Many Japanese words incorporate ki: genki (healthy, literally 'original ki'), kimochi (feeling, 'ki-持ち'), kokoro (heart/mind, containing ki character), tenki (weather, 'heaven-ki').",
