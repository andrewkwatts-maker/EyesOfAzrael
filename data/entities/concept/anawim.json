  "shortDescription": "Hebrew term for the humble poor who depend entirely on God - the 'poor in spirit' whom Jesus blessed and James championed",
  "longDescription": "Anawim (Hebrew: ענוים, plural of ani/anaw) refers to the 'humble poor' or 'afflicted ones' - those who, having nothing in the world to rely upon, place their complete trust in God. This concept developed through Israel's prophetic tradition, transforming economic poverty into a spiritual disposition of radical dependence on God. The Psalms frequently portray YHWH as the protector and vindicator of the anawim: 'The LORD hears the needy' (Psalm 69:33). In post-exilic Judaism, the anawim became associated with the faithful remnant who remained loyal to Torah despite persecution. By the time of Jesus, they represented those who awaited God's kingdom with humble expectation - like Zechariah, Elizabeth, Simeon, Anna, and Mary herself who declared 'He has lifted up the humble' (Luke 1:52). Jesus' first beatitude, 'Blessed are the poor in spirit' (Matthew 5:3), directly addresses the anawim, declaring them heirs of God's kingdom. The Epistle of James passionately defends the anawim: 'Has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom?' (James 2:5). James excoriates the rich who oppress the poor (James 5:1-6), condemns partiality favoring the wealthy (James 2:1-4), and defines 'pure religion' as caring for orphans and widows (James 1:27). As leader of the Jerusalem church known for its care for the poor, James the Just embodied the anawim tradition, himself living an ascetic life of radical dependence on God.",
