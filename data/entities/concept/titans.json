  "fullDescription": "The Elder Gods - Generation Before the Olympians\n\nThe twelve Titans were the children of Gaia (Earth) and Uranus (Sky), powerful beings who ruled during the Golden Age under Cronos before being overthrown by Zeus and the Olympians in the cosmic war called the Titanomachy.\n\nAccording to Hesiod's Theogony, the twelve Titans were:\n\nMale Titans:\n1. Oceanus - the world-encircling river\n2. Coeus - Titan of intelligence, father of Leto\n3. Crius - Titan of constellations\n4. Hyperion - Titan of light, father of Helios, Selene, Eos\n5. Iapetus - father of Prometheus, Atlas, Epimetheus\n6. Cronos - youngest and most powerful, king of Titans\n\nFemale Titans (Titanides):\n1. Theia - Titan of sight and the shining sky\n2. Rhea - mother of the Olympians\n3. Themis - Titan of divine law and order\n4. Mnemosyne - Titan of memory, mother of the Muses\n5. Phoebe - Titan of prophecy, grandmother of Apollo and Artemis\n6. Tethys - wife of Oceanus, mother of river gods\n\nThe Succession Myth\n\nUranus, fearful of his children's power, imprisoned the Cyclopes and Hecatoncheires in Gaia's womb. Gaia, in pain and rage, fashioned an adamantine sickle and asked her Titan children to strike against their father. Only Cronos was willing. He ambushed Uranus and castrated him, becoming king of the cosmos and inaugurating the Golden Age.\n\nBut Cronos proved equally tyrannical. Warned that his own child would overthrow him, he swallowed each of his children by Rhea as they were born. Rhea, grieving, hid the infant Zeus and tricked Cronos with a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes.\n\nThe Titanomachy\n\nWhen Zeus reached maturity, he forced Cronos to regurgitate his siblings. The Olympians then waged war against the Titans for ten years. The war was won when Zeus freed the Cyclopes (who gave him the thunderbolt) and the Hecatoncheires (who hurled mountains). The defeated Titans were imprisoned in Tartarus, guarded by the Hecatoncheires.\n\nNot all Titans opposed Zeus. Themis, Mnemosyne, and Prometheus were honored by the Olympians. The second-generation Titans (children of the twelve) played various roles: Atlas was condemned to hold the sky, while Prometheus was punished for helping humanity.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe word 'titanic' derives from these elder gods, connoting immense size and power. The Titans represent the older, more chaotic forces of nature that must be subdued for civilized order to emerge - yet they remain the ancestors of the Olympians, and their power persists in the cosmos.",
