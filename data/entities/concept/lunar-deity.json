  "fullDescription": "The Lunar Deity embodies the mysterious, cyclical, and transformative aspects of celestial divinity. Unlike the constant sun, the moon visibly changes—waxing from invisibility to fullness, waning back to darkness, then being 'reborn' in an endless cycle. This makes the moon the natural symbol of cycles, transformation, time measurement (the word 'month' derives from 'moon'), fertility synchronized with menstrual rhythms, and the hidden or unconscious realms. Notably, lunar deities vary significantly by gender across cultures: feminine in Greek (Selene, Artemis, Hecate as triple goddess), masculine in Mesopotamian (Nanna/Sin) and Hindu (Chandra) traditions, reflecting different cultural associations with lunar power. The moon's connection to water (tides), madness ('lunacy'), magic, night mysteries, and feminine reproductive cycles makes lunar deities liminal figures—guardians of thresholds, crossroads, and transitions. The moon illuminates darkness but with reflected light, not its own—making it a symbol of intuitive, receptive wisdom rather than direct solar knowing.",
