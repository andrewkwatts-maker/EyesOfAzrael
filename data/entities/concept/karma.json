  "fullDescription": "Karma (Sanskrit: कर्म, literally 'action' or 'deed') is the fundamental law of cause and effect that governs all existence in Hindu philosophy. Every action - physical, verbal, or mental - creates karma that determines future experiences. Good actions (punya) create positive karma leading to favorable circumstances, while bad actions (papa) create negative karma leading to suffering. Karma operates across multiple lifetimes, with accumulated karma from past lives (sanchita karma) determining one's current birth, circumstances, and experiences (prarabdha karma). The karma being created in the present (kriyamana karma) will bear fruit in this or future lives. The law of karma ensures cosmic justice - no action goes without consequence, and current circumstances are the result of past actions. However, karma is not fatalistic; through right action, knowledge, and devotion, one can neutralize negative karma and eventually achieve liberation (moksha) from the cycle of karma and rebirth.",

It explains differences in people's circumstances as results of past actions rather than divine whim or chance. The Bhagavad Gita teaches karma yoga - performing actions selflessly without attachment to results - as a path to liberation. Understanding karma encourages ethical behavior and acceptance of life circumstances while motivating spiritual practice to transcend karmic bondage.",

      "symbolism": "Karma symbolizes the perfect balance and justice inherent in the universe - every action creates an equal and appropriate reaction. The scales of justice often represent karma's balancing function. Karma's operation across lifetimes represents the continuity of the soul and the long-term consequences of choices. The concept that karma can be transcended represents the possibility of liberation from material existence through spiritual knowledge and right action. Karma's inevitability (you reap what you sow) combined with freedom to act differently (free will) represents the paradox of determination and choice.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Karma profoundly influences Hindu ethics, social attitudes, and spiritual practice. It provides a framework for understanding suffering and injustice as consequences of past actions rather than divine punishment or randomness. This has been criticized for potentially justifying social inequalities, but it also empowers individuals with responsibility for their destiny. The concept encourages ethical behavior (to create good karma), acceptance of circumstances (as fruition of past karma), and spiritual practice (to transcend karma entirely). Karma has become a global concept, influencing Western thought and popular culture."
