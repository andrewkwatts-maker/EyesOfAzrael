  "shortDescription": "The practice of keeping the Mosaic Law within early Jewish Christianity - the domain of James the Just and the Jerusalem church",
  "longDescription": "Torah observance refers to the practice of keeping the commandments of the Mosaic Law (Hebrew: Torah), including Sabbath, dietary laws, circumcision, and the full 613 commandments. In earliest Christianity, this was not a question but an assumption - Jesus and his disciples were observant Jews. The question arose only when Gentiles began entering the community: must they become Jews (through circumcision and full Torah observance) to follow the Jewish Messiah? This question was addressed at the Jerusalem Council (Acts 15), where James the Just, leader of the Jerusalem church, issued the definitive ruling: Gentiles need not be circumcised but should abstain from idolatrous contamination (food sacrificed to idols, blood, things strangled, and sexual immorality). This 'Apostolic Decree' represented a middle path - Gentiles were not required to become Jews, but must maintain enough purity to share table fellowship with Jewish believers. James himself remained a Torah-observant Jew his entire life. Hegesippus reports he was a Nazarite who never cut his hair, drank wine, or ate meat. His epistle emphasizes that 'faith without works is dead' (James 2:26) - works understood within the Torah's ethical framework. The Jerusalem church under James continued Temple worship and Torah observance while believing in Jesus as Messiah. This Jewish Christianity was eventually marginalized as the Gentile church grew dominant, but James represents the original synthesis of Torah piety and faith in Christ.",
