  "fullDescription": "The Zealot Movement (Hebrew: קנאים, Qanna'im; Greek: Ζηλωταί, Zelotai) was a first-century Jewish political and religious movement that advocated armed resistance against Roman occupation of Judea. Founded by Judas the Galilean during the Roman census of 6 CE, the Zealots viewed paying taxes to Rome as a form of idolatry - a violation of the fundamental Jewish confession that 'YHWH is our God, YHWH alone' (Deut 6:4). They believed that God alone should rule Israel, and that faithful Jews had a religious obligation to resist foreign domination by force. The movement drew inspiration from biblical models of violent zeal, particularly Phinehas who killed an Israelite and Midianite woman engaged in idolatrous worship (Num 25) and was praised for his 'zeal' (qin'ah), as well as the Maccabean revolt which had successfully overthrown Greek oppression through armed resistance. The Zealots played a major role in the Jewish War against Rome (66-73 CE), which ended in the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple (70 CE) and the fall of Masada (73 CE). The movement represents a significant context for understanding early Christianity, as Jesus' teachings on loving enemies, rendering unto Caesar, and the nature of God's Kingdom stood in tension with Zealot ideology. At least one of Jesus' twelve apostles - Simon the Zealot - was associated with the movement, illustrating the transformative power of Christ's call that converted political revolutionaries into spiritual missionaries.",
