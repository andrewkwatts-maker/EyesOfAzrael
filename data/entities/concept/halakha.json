  "shortDescription": "Jewish religious law guiding how to 'walk' in God's ways - the path of righteous living",
  "fullDescription": "Halakha (Hebrew: הֲלָכָה, literally 'the way of walking') is the collective body of Jewish religious law derived from the written Torah and oral tradition. The term comes from the Hebrew root h-l-k (הלך) meaning 'to walk,' reflecting the fundamental Jewish concept that religious observance is not merely belief but a way of walking through life. This pedestrian metaphor pervades Jewish spirituality: one 'walks' with God (Genesis 5:22), 'walks' in God's statutes (Leviticus 26:3), and follows the 'way' of righteousness. Proverbs contrasts the 'way of wisdom' with the 'way of folly' (Proverbs 4:11-14). When Thomas asked Jesus 'How can we know the way?' (John 14:5), he drew upon this profound Jewish concept. The earliest Christians were called followers of 'the Way' (Acts 9:2, 19:9, 24:14), demonstrating how Jesus' teaching was understood as halakha - authoritative guidance on how to walk with God. Halakha encompasses every aspect of human life, from prayers and Sabbath observance to business ethics and family relations, providing a comprehensive path for walking righteously before God.",

Thomas' question 'How can we know the way?' reflects Jewish epistemological concern with knowing the correct path."

      "culturalSignificance": "Halakha has preserved Jewish identity through millennia of exile. By carrying the 'way' with them, Jews maintained their distinctive practices regardless of location.

    "significance": "Thomas' question 'Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?' (John 14:5) is profoundly Jewish.

    "epistemology": "Jewish tradition values knowing the right way over mere belief. Thomas demands clarity about the path, echoing the Jewish concern with practical righteousness. His question prompts Jesus' greatest 'I AM' statement: 'I am the way, the truth, and the life.'",
    "earlyChurch": "The fact that early Christians were called 'followers of the Way' (Acts 9:2, 19:9, 24:14) shows they understood Jesus' teaching as halakha - authoritative instruction on how to walk with God. Thomas' question about 'the way' connects directly to this self-understanding."
