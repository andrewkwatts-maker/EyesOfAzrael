  "shortDescription": "Ancient Celtic alphabet of 20-25 characters, each associated with a tree and mystical meanings",
  "fullDescription": "Ogham (Old Irish: Ogam) is the earliest known Irish script, consisting of groups of lines carved along the edge of standing stones or wooden staves. Each of the 20 primary characters (with later additions bringing it to 25) is associated with a tree, giving rise to the 'Tree Alphabet.' Beyond simple writing, ogham possessed mystical significance - used for divination, magical spells, and encoding sacred knowledge. Its invention is attributed to the god Ogma, deity of eloquence and learning.",

This creates a multi-layered symbolic system where writing becomes a form of magical encoding. The linear nature represents the path of knowledge, while the association with trees connects the alphabet to the natural world and sacred groves.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Ogham represents the native Irish writing system, predating Latin script in Ireland. Over 400 ogham stones survive across Ireland, Britain, and Irish settlements. The system influenced modern Neo-Pagan and Druidic practices, where ogham is used for divination. It demonstrates the Celtic integration of literacy, nature worship, and mystical practice."
