  "fullDescription": "Hubris (Greek: ὕβρις) is excessive pride, arrogance, or overconfidence—particularly the presumption to challenge or equal the gods. In Greek thought, hubris represents the dangerous transgression of proper human limits, violating the natural order and cosmic balance. Those guilty of hubris inevitably suffer nemesis (divine retribution), often through tragic reversal of fortune. Hubris manifests as boasting about superiority, attempting divine prerogatives, refusing to honor the gods, or believing oneself beyond divine law. The concept embodies Greek emphasis on moderation, self-knowledge ('know thyself'), and recognition of human mortality versus divine immortality. Hubris-driven downfall forms the core of Greek tragedy, where heroes' excessive pride leads to catastrophe despite (or because of) their greatness.",

      "symbolism": "Hubris symbolizes humanity's perpetual temptation to transcend proper limits and the inevitable correction enforced by cosmic order. It represents the dangerous edge of human excellence—where arete (virtue) tips into arrogance. The hubris-nemesis cycle embodies Greek belief in balance, justice, and the ultimate sovereignty of divine law. Hubris teaches that greatness requires self-awareness and humility; excellence without moderation becomes vice.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Hubris became foundational to Greek tragedy and ethics, teaching that no mortal—regardless of power, wisdom, or achievement—stands above divine law. The concept profoundly influenced Western literature, philosophy, and psychology. 'Hubris' entered English denoting dangerous overconfidence. The warning against hubris shaped Western political thought (power corrupts), legal philosophy (no one above the law), and cautionary tales about unchecked ambition. Modern usage applies hubris to corporate overreach, political arrogance, and technological overconfidence—the ancient warning remains relevant."
