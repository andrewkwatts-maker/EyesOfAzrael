  "fullDescription": "Yin and Yang (陰陽, yīn yáng) is the foundational principle in Chinese philosophy describing the dualistic yet complementary nature of all phenomena. Yin (陰) represents qualities like darkness, passivity, femininity, cold, moon, earth, and receptivity, while Yang (陽) embodies light, activity, masculinity, heat, sun, heaven, and creativity. Rather than absolute opposites, yin and yang are interdependent, transforming into each other in cyclical patterns. All things contain both aspects in varying proportions, and balance between them creates harmony. This concept underlies Chinese cosmology, medicine, martial arts, and spiritual practice.",
