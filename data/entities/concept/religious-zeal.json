  "fullDescription": "Religious zeal (Hebrew: קנאה, qin'ah; Greek: ζῆλος, zelos) represents one of the most complex and consequential concepts in religious history: the passionate devotion to God that demands total commitment and may inspire either violence against perceived enemies of faith or self-sacrificing love for all people. The concept originates in the Hebrew Bible's description of God's own 'jealousy' (qin'ah) for Israel's exclusive worship, which then becomes a model for human zeal. Phinehas's violent act against idolaters (Numbers 25) was praised as zeal, establishing a paradigm that would later inspire the Zealot movement and concepts of holy war across religions. Yet the same scriptural tradition presents prophetic zeal that suffers persecution rather than inflicts it (Elijah, Jeremiah), and ultimately in Christianity, the transformation of zeal from killing for God to dying for others (martyrdom). Simon the Zealot's journey from revolutionary violence to apostolic mission embodies this transformation. The question of religious zeal - whether passionate faith should express itself in violence or in sacrificial love - remains urgent across religious traditions. The distinction between 'zeal for God' that kills and 'zeal for God's house' that drives Jesus to cleanse the Temple without harming persons represents a crucial ethical boundary.",

      "description": "In Judaism, zeal (qin'ah) originates from God's own 'jealousy' for Israel's exclusive worship (Exod 20:5). This divine attribute becomes a model for human action. Phinehas's violent zeal against idolaters was rewarded with covenant of peace (Num 25). The Maccabees exemplified zealous resistance to pagan oppression. The Zealot movement carried this tradition into conflict with Rome. Yet prophetic tradition also presents zeal that suffers rather than kills (Elijah's persecution, Jeremiah's suffering)."

      "description": "Christianity transformed the concept of zeal from violence to witness. Jesus demonstrated 'zeal for God's house' (John 2:17) in cleansing the Temple, but without violence against persons. His teachings on enemy love (Matt 5:44), non-resistance (Matt 5:39), and 'those who take the sword will perish by the sword' (Matt 26:52) challenged Zealot ideology. Paul speaks of his former persecution of the church as misguided zeal (Phil 3:6), then redefines proper zeal as 'fervent in spirit' service (Rom 12:11). Simon the Zealot's transformation embodies the conversion of violent zeal to evangelistic mission. Christian martyrdom (dying as witness) replaced holy war (killing for God)."

While the greater jihad is understood as spiritual struggle against sin, the lesser jihad (armed defense) has been variously interpreted throughout Islamic history. The tension between violent and non-violent expressions of religious devotion parallels similar debates in other traditions."
