  "shortDescription": "Fate or destiny as the inescapable portion allotted to each being, personified by the three Moirai (Fates)",
  "fullDescription": "Moira (Greek: Μοῖρα, 'portion' or 'lot') is fate, destiny, or the portion allotted to each mortal and god. The concept has both abstract and personified forms—as abstract principle, moira is the cosmic order determining each being's destiny; personified, the Moirai are three sisters (Clotho, Lachesis, Atropos) who spin, measure, and cut the thread of life. Even Zeus cannot override moira, suggesting fate transcends divine will. For mortals, moira determines lifespan and manner of death. Heroes knowing their moira (like Achilles knowing he'll die young) face the tragic choice of accepting fate or futilely resisting. Moira embodies the Greek tragic vision: some things are fated and unavoidable, but nobility comes from facing destiny with courage and excellence. The concept balances free will and determinism—humans choose how to meet their fate, not whether to meet it.",

      "symbolism": "Moira symbolizes life's non-negotiable limits—death, aging, and certain key events cannot be avoided. The thread metaphor suggests life's fragility and measured duration. The Moirai's indifference to status (affecting gods and mortals) represents fate's democracy and justice. Moira embodies the Greek tragic vision: knowing one's fate doesn't permit escape, but facing destiny courageously demonstrates arete. The concept balances divine power (gods are mighty) with cosmic limits (even Zeus bows to fate), suggesting ultimate order transcends individual will. Moira represents the boundary between what we control (our response) and what we don't (our portion).",
      "culturalSignificance": "Moira shaped Greek literature, particularly tragedy where protagonists face inescapable fate. The concept influenced Western ideas of destiny, predestination, and the tragic hero. The Fates (Moirai) became archetypal figures appearing across Western literature and art. 'Fatal,' 'fatalism,' and 'fate' derive from this tradition. The tension between fate and free will remains central to Western philosophy and theology. Modern discussions of determinism versus agency echo ancient moira debates. The concept taught Greeks to accept the uncontrollable while still striving for excellence—a philosophy relevant to human limitation and mortality."
