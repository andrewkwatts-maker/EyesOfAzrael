  "fullDescription": "The Tao (道, Dào, also Dao) is the fundamental, ineffable principle at the heart of Daoist philosophy - the nameless, formless source from which all things arise and to which all return. Often translated as 'The Way,' the Tao is simultaneously the path of natural order, the cosmic process of change, and the ultimate reality beyond description. Paradoxically both empty and full, it operates through wu wei (non-action) and manifests in the harmonious flow of nature. The Tao cannot be fully grasped intellectually but can be experienced through alignment with its natural patterns. Understanding and following the Tao leads to harmony, wisdom, and spiritual realization.",
