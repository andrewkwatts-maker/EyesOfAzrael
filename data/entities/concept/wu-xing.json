  "shortDescription": "Five Elements theory - the cyclical system of Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water",
  "fullDescription": "Wu Xing (五行, Wǔ Xíng, literally 'Five Phases' or 'Five Elements') is a fundamental framework in Chinese thought describing the dynamic interplay of five elemental forces: Wood (木), Fire (火), Earth (土), Metal (金), and Water (水). Unlike Western elements, these are not static substances but active phases in constant transformation, interacting through generative (創生) and destructive (相剋) cycles. Wood feeds Fire, Fire creates Earth (ash), Earth bears Metal, Metal collects Water, Water nourishes Wood. This system underlies Chinese medicine, astrology, feng shui, martial arts, and cosmology.",

The generative cycle shows creative progression, while the destructive cycle maintains balance through control. Each element contains the potential for transformation into others, reflecting the constant flux of existence. The system embodies both harmony (when balanced) and conflict (when imbalanced).",
      "culturalSignificance": "Wu Xing has influenced Chinese civilization for over 2,000 years, shaping medicine, philosophy, art, architecture, and daily life. The system appears in Chinese chess, cuisine (balancing flavors), color symbolism, and seasonal festivals. It remains central to Traditional Chinese Medicine, feng shui practice, and Chinese astrology."
