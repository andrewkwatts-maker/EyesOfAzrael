  "shortDescription": "Divine spirits or gods that inhabit all things, the central concept of Shinto religion",
  "fullDescription": "Kami (神) are the divine spirits or sacred essences that permeate all existence in Shinto belief. The term is notoriously difficult to translate, encompassing gods, spirits, sacred forces, and the divine quality within natural phenomena. Kami can be major deities like Amaterasu and Susanoo, ancestral spirits, natural forces (mountains, rivers, storms), animals, and even abstract concepts. The phrase 'yaoyorozu no kami' (八百万の神, 'eight million kami') suggests their countless number. Unlike the monotheistic concept of God, kami are immanent rather than transcendent, dwelling within the world rather than beyond it. Kami can be benevolent or dangerous, peaceful or violent, protective or wrathful. They are not omnipotent or morally perfect but possess specific powers and characteristics. Humans can become kami after death, especially powerful rulers or those who died tragically. The relationship between humans and kami is reciprocal: humans offer worship and purification, while kami provide blessings and protection. Kami respond to ritual purity (harae) and are repelled by pollution (kegare).",
