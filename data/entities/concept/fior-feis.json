  "fullDescription": "Fíor-Feis (Irish: 'True Wedding' or 'Rightful Feast') was the sacred marriage ritual between a king and the goddess of sovereignty, representing the land itself. This hieros gamos (sacred marriage) was essential for legitimate kingship in ancient Ireland. The king symbolically or literally married the land, embodied by a goddess figure, ensuring prosperity, fertility, and rightful rule. Without this sacred union, the king lacked true authority and the land would not flourish.",

      "symbolism": "Represents the sacred bond between ruler and ruled, the king as husband of the land rather than its master. The transformation of the hag to maiden symbolizes the land's response to good kingship - under a rightful king, the land flourishes; under a tyrant, it becomes barren. The sexual union represents fertility, prosperity, and the mystical union of masculine and feminine principles.",
      "culturalSignificance": "The Fíor-Feis embodies the Celtic concept that sovereignty is feminine, granted by the goddess to worthy kings who serve the land. This matriarchal element in kingship persisted through Christianization. The ritual influenced medieval concepts of kingship throughout Europe and appears transformed in Arthurian legend (Arthur's right to rule confirmed by drawing Excalibur, representing the land's choice)."
