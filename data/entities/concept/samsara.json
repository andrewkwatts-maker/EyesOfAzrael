  "fullDescription": "Samsara (Sanskrit: संसार, literally 'wandering' or 'flowing on') is the fundamental concept in Hinduism describing the continuous cycle of birth, death, and rebirth (reincarnation) through which all beings transmigrate. Driven by karma (the law of cause and effect) and fueled by desire and ignorance, the soul (atman) repeatedly takes birth in various forms - human, animal, divine, or demonic - according to the karma accumulated in previous lives. Each life presents opportunities to create new karma through actions, perpetuating the cycle. Samsara is characterized by dukkha (suffering) in Buddhist terms, or by the temporary nature of all pleasures and achievements. Even birth in heaven (Swarga) is temporary within samsara - once one's merit is exhausted, rebirth occurs. The cycle continues indefinitely until liberation (moksha) is achieved through spiritual realization, transcendence of desire and karma, or divine grace. Samsara is not merely physical rebirth but includes psychological patterns and mental formations that perpetuate suffering and bondage across lifetimes.",

It encompasses all realms of existence - from the highest heavens to the lowest hells - all of which are impermanent and subject to rebirth. The concept explains individual differences and suffering as results of past karma, provides motivation for ethical behavior and spiritual practice, and gives context to the ultimate goal of moksha. Stories of beings remembering past lives and accounts of the intermediate state between death and rebirth (antarabhava) illustrate the reality of samsara.",

      "symbolism": "The wheel symbolizes samsara most powerfully - constantly turning, cyclic, no beginning or end, carrying beings around and around. The spokes of the wheel represent the different realms of existence. Water flowing in a river symbolizes samsara's continuous movement. The analogy of changing clothes (from Bhagavad Gita) - the soul discarding old bodies and taking new ones like changing garments - illustrates the continuity of consciousness through apparent death. Samsara as a burning house (in Buddhist texts) represents the urgency of seeking liberation from suffering.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Samsara is foundational to Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain worldviews, profoundly influencing ethics, philosophy, and spiritual practice. The concept provides a framework for understanding life's purpose, suffering's origin, and the importance of spiritual liberation. Belief in rebirth affects attitudes toward death, karma, and moral responsibility. The teaching that current circumstances result from past actions (across lives) has been both empowering (you create your destiny) and problematic (potentially justifying suffering as deserved). Modern Hinduism continues to grapple with interpreting samsara in ways relevant to contemporary life while maintaining its essential truth as the bondage from which liberation is sought."
