  "fullDescription": "A geis (plural: geasa) is a supernatural obligation, prohibition, or taboo placed upon individuals in Irish mythology. These can be blessings or curses, commands to do something or prohibitions against doing something. Breaking a geis brings terrible consequences - loss of strength, honor, or life itself. Kings and heroes were particularly bound by geasa, which often became central to their tragic fates. The concept embodies the Celtic understanding of honor, fate, and the binding nature of sacred oaths.",

It demonstrates a worldview where supernatural and social obligations have equal force. The concept influenced later ideas about quests, oaths, and tragic fate in European literature."
