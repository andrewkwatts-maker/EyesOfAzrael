  "shortDescription": "Ritual purification that removes kegare (impurity) and restores connection with kami",
  "fullDescription": "Harae (祓) or harai is the Shinto practice of purification and ritual cleansing that removes kegare (ritual impurity) and restores one to a state of purity suitable for communion with kami. The prototype for all harae is Izanagi's purification after escaping from Yomi (the underworld)—he washed himself in a river, and from the purification emerged the three noble kami: Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi, and Susanoo. This established water purification as fundamental to Shinto practice. Harae takes many forms: misogi (水禊, water purification through immersion or ablution), temizu (手水, hand and mouth washing at shrine entrances), oharae (大祓, great purification ceremonies held biannually), harae-gushi (祓串, ritual wand waving), and salt purification. Harae is performed before entering sacred spaces, after contact with death or illness, at life transitions, to begin new enterprises, and regularly to maintain spiritual cleanliness. The practice is both physical (water, salt) and verbal (norito prayers). Harae doesn't remove moral guilt but rather spiritual pollution that naturally accumulates through living. The concept emphasizes renewal and return to original purity rather than sin and redemption.",
