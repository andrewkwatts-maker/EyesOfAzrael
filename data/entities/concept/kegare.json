  "shortDescription": "Ritual impurity or pollution, particularly associated with death, disease, and bodily functions",
  "fullDescription": "Kegare (穢れ or 汚れ) is the Shinto concept of ritual impurity or pollution that separates humans from the sacred realm of kami. Unlike moral sin or ethical wrongdoing, kegare is a state of spiritual pollution that naturally occurs through contact with death, disease, blood, and other liminal states. The concept originated from Izanagi's journey to Yomi (the underworld) to retrieve his dead wife Izanami—when he saw her decayed body and fled, he became polluted by death and required extensive purification. Kegare is not inherently evil but represents disorder, decay, and the dissolution of boundaries. Sources of kegare include: death and corpses (the most severe), mourning, blood (menstruation, childbirth, wounds), disease and bodily emissions, certain foods, and violation of sacred spaces. Kegare is contagious and must be removed through harae (purification) before one can approach kami or participate in sacred activities. The system of kegare historically influenced social structure, with certain occupations (handling corpses, butchering, leather work) considered polluting and those who performed them marginalized as outcasts (burakumin). Modern Shinto maintains some kegare concepts (mourners avoid shrines, purification before worship) while rejecting discriminatory applications.",
