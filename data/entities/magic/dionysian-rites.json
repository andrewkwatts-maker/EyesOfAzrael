  "fullDescription": "The Dionysian Mysteries\nwere secret religious rites dedicated to Dionysus, god of wine, fertility, and ecstatic liberation.\nThrough ritual intoxication, frenzied dance, and theatrical performance, initiates sought divine madness that dissolved boundaries between\nhuman and divine, civilization and nature, order and chaos.\n\nSacred wine was central to Dionysian worship, representing the god's blood and divine essence. Ritual intoxication lowered inhibitions and opened participants to ecstatic experience and divine possession.\n\nSymbolism: Liberation, transformation, divine communion",
