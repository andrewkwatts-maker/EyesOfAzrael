  "shortDescription": "Both a legendary Egyptian text attributed to Thoth containing all magical and astronomical knowledge, and Aleister Crowley's 1944 commentary on the Thoth Tarot deck synthesizing Hermetic Qabalah, Egyptian symbolism, and Thelemic philosophy",
  "fullDescription": "The Book of Thoth exists in dual form across history. In ancient Egyptian mythology, it represents a legendary sacred text written by Thoth (Greek: Hermes Trismegistus), god of wisdom, writing, and magic, containing the secrets of the universe, powerful spells, and divine knowledge. This mythical text was sought by magicians and priests throughout antiquity, appearing in tales like the Setne Khamwas stories (Ptolemaic period), where it grants forbidden knowledge at terrible cost. In modern esoteric tradition, The Book of Thoth (1944) refers to Aleister Crowley's monumental 300-page commentary on the Thoth Tarot deck created with artist Lady Frieda Harris. This text represents one of the most comprehensive treatments of Tarot symbolism, integrating the 22 paths of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, astrological attributions, Egyptian deity correspondences, Thelemic philosophy, alchemical symbolism, and color theory. Crowley's work builds on Golden Dawn teachings while incorporating his revolutionary Thelemic insights and deep Egyptian scholarship. The text provides card-by-card analysis of all 78 cards with their Hebrew letter, astrological, elemental, and Qabalistic associations, making it essential for serious students of Western esotericism.",
