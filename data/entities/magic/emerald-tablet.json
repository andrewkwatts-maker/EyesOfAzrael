  "shortDescription": "Brief cryptic text (c. 13 lines) attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, containing the fundamental formula of alchemy and Hermetic philosophy, most famous for 'That which is below is like that which is above'",
  "fullDescription": "The Emerald Tablet (Latin: Tabula Smaragdina; Arabic: Lawḥ al-Zumurrudh) is perhaps the most influential and enigmatic text in Western esoteric tradition—a brief, cryptic formula of approximately 13 lines (varying by version) that encapsulates the entire philosophy and practice of alchemy in concentrated symbolic language. Attributed to Hermes Trismegistus and legendarily inscribed on a tablet of emerald, the text first appears in Arabic sources around 800 CE (Kitāb sirr al-khalīqa, 'Book of the Secret of Creation' by Pseudo-Apollonius of Tyana/Balinus), then enters Latin Europe via 12th-century translations. The Tablet's most famous line—'That which is below is like that which is above, and that which is above is like that which is below, to accomplish the miracles of the one thing'—became the foundational principle of correspondence between microcosm and macrocosm, permeating magic, alchemy, astrology, and esoteric philosophy. The text describes the creation of all things from the One Thing (prima materia) through separation and recombination, governed by the Sun (father) and Moon (mother), carried by Wind (air), and nourished by Earth. It promises that through understanding this process, one gains 'the glory of the whole world' and conquers 'every subtle thing' and 'penetrates every solid thing.' Medieval and Renaissance alchemists interpreted the Tablet as encoding the Great Work—the transmutation of base metals to gold and the spiritual transformation of the soul. Its influence extends from Islamic alchemy through Roger Bacon, Albertus Magnus, and Isaac Newton (who translated it multiple times) to modern occultism and New Age thought.",
