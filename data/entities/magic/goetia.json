  "shortDescription": "Medieval grimoire and demon evocation system describing 72 demons (spirits) of the Ars Goetia, each with unique seals, powers, and ranks, traditionally bound and commanded using the authority of King Solomon, the magic circle, triangle of art, and brass vessel",
  "fullDescription": "The Goetia, formally titled 'Lemegeton Clavicula Salomonis' or 'The Lesser Key of Solomon,' is the most famous grimoire of demon magic in Western occultism, consisting of detailed descriptions of 72 demons or spirits along with their seals, ranks, abilities, and methods of evocation. Compiled in the mid-17th century but drawing on medieval and Renaissance magical traditions, the Goetia presents itself as wisdom passed down from the biblical King Solomon, who legendarily commanded demons to build his temple. The 72 spirits form a hierarchy of infernal nobility including Kings, Dukes, Princes, Marquises, Presidents, Earls, and Knights, each governing legions of lesser spirits and offering specific powers such as discovering treasures, teaching sciences, revealing secrets, causing love or discord, making one invisible, or bringing familiars. Each demon has a unique seal or signature that must be drawn accurately, and the system requires elaborate ritual paraphernalia including a magic circle for protection (inscribed with divine names), a triangle of art (where the spirit manifests), a brass vessel (to constrain disobedient spirits), a magic ring, lamens (talismans worn on the chest), and sometimes a hexagram of Solomon. The magician operates under the authority of divine names (Adonai, Tetragrammaton, etc.) and archangels (Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel), compelling the demons to appear and serve through invocations, conjurations, and threats of binding. The practice is considered dangerous because demons may resist, deceive, attack if the circle is broken, or extract hidden prices for their services. The Goetia was popularized in modern times by S.L. MacGregor Mathers' 1904 translation and Aleister Crowley's illustrated edition, bringing it into Golden Dawn and Thelemic practice. Contemporary magicians approach Goetic spirits variously as: literal demons (traditional Christian view), aspects of the subconscious mind (psychological model), or neutral spiritual intelligences (non-dualistic view). Modern chaos magicians often simplify the elaborate ceremonial requirements while retaining core elements like seals and invocations. The system continues to fascinate and disturb, representing the Western magical tradition's attempt to harness and command the powers of the underworld through ritual authority, divine names, and psychological confrontation with shadow forces.",

Many magicians consider Goetia the 'deep end' of ceremonial magic. Approach with maximum respect, preparation, and caution.",
