  "fullDescription": "The Olympic Games\nwere far more than athletic competitions - they were a sacred festival honoring Zeus, king of the gods,\nheld every four years at his great sanctuary in Olympia. For five days, the Greek world paused in sacred truce (ekecheiria) as athletes,\nspectators, and pilgrims gathered to witness human excellence dedicated to divine glory. The games combined religious ritual, artistic\nperformance, and physical contests, embodying the Greek ideal of kalokagathia\n(beauty and goodness united).\n\nThe most prominent foundation myth tells of Pelops defeating King Oenomaus in a chariot race to win Princess Hippodamia, establishing funeral games that evolved into the Olympics.\n\nStory: Oenomaus challenged suitors to chariot race, killing losers",
