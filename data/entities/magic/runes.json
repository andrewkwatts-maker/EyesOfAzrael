  "fullDescription": "Runes (from Old Norse 'rún' meaning 'secret' or 'mystery') are the letters of ancient Germanic alphabets that served dual purposes as both a writing system and a magical tool. The earliest attestations of runic writing appear around 150 CE in Scandinavia and Germanic territories, though the system likely developed somewhat earlier. Unlike purely phonetic alphabets, each rune carried symbolic meaning, magical power, and associations with cosmic forces. According to Norse mythology, the god Odin discovered the runes through a shamanic ordeal described in the Hávamál, hanging himself on the world tree Yggdrasil for nine nights, pierced by his own spear, without food or water, gazing into the abyss below. Through this self-sacrifice, he perceived the runes and grasped them, gaining their wisdom and power. This myth establishes runes as divine knowledge obtained through sacrifice and worthy of profound respect.",

  "effects": "Rune divination provides guidance on situations, reveals hidden influences, and offers perspective on challenges. Beyond divination, rune meditation develops connection to Norse spiritual traditions and archetypal wisdom. Runic magic (carving for specific purposes) can be used for protection, empowerment, and manifestation. Regular practice deepens understanding of Norse cosmology and develops symbolic thinking. The runes serve as tools for self-knowledge and spiritual development within Germanic Pagan traditions.",
  "warnings": "Respect the runes as sacred tools from a living spiritual tradition. Avoid using runes frivolously or purely for entertainment. Traditional practitioners emphasize that runes should not be used harmfully or for manipulation. Some Nordic/Germanic symbols have been unfortunately appropriated by hate groups—be aware of this history and reject such misuse. The blank rune 'Wyrd' is a modern invention (1980s) with no historical precedent; traditional practitioners typically don't use it. Proper cultural context and respect for Norse/Germanic heritage is important when working with runes.",
