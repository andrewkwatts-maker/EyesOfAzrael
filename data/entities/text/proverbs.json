  "shortDescription": "The wisdom book of Solomon containing practical instruction for righteous living, a fountainhead of the Epistle of James and Jewish wisdom tradition",
  "longDescription": "The Book of Proverbs (Hebrew: Mishlei, meaning 'proverbs' or 'parables') is the central wisdom text of the Hebrew Bible, traditionally attributed to King Solomon, son of David. It contains collections of practical wisdom sayings (mashal) that teach the art of skillful living (chokmah). Proverbs stands at the head of Israel's wisdom literature tradition that includes Ecclesiastes, Job, and the apocryphal Wisdom of Solomon and Sirach. The book personifies Wisdom (Chokmah) as a divine feminine figure who was present at creation (Proverbs 8), inviting all to follow her ways. Unlike Torah's legal commandments, Proverbs offers moral instruction through observation of life, the natural world, and human relationships. Its teachings on controlling the tongue, the contrast between rich and poor, the dangers of anger, and the nature of true wisdom profoundly influenced the Epistle of James, which echoes Proverbs throughout. James 3:17 on 'wisdom from above' directly parallels Proverbs 2 on the path of wisdom. The opening command to 'fear the LORD' (Proverbs 1:7) establishes that true wisdom begins with reverence for God - a theme James the Just embodied through Torah-observant piety.",
