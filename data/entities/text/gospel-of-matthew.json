  "shortDescription": "First Gospel in the New Testament canon, presenting Jesus as the Jewish Messiah who fulfills Hebrew prophecy, written for Jewish-Christian audiences",
  "longDescription": "The Gospel of Matthew stands as the bridge between the Hebrew Scriptures and the New Testament, opening with a genealogy tracing Jesus from Abraham through David to establish his messianic credentials. Written primarily for Jewish-Christian communities, likely in Antioch, Syria, this Gospel systematically demonstrates that Jesus fulfills every prophecy concerning the Messiah. Its distinctive 'fulfillment formula' - 'This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet' - appears over a dozen times, connecting Jesus' virgin birth, Bethlehem birthplace, Egyptian sojourn, Galilean ministry, healing work, triumphal entry, and betrayal price to specific Old Testament passages. The Gospel's five major teaching discourses (Sermon on the Mount, Missionary Discourse, Parables Discourse, Church Discourse, and Olivet Discourse) deliberately mirror the five books of Moses, presenting Jesus as the new lawgiver giving new Torah from a new mountain. Matthew's preferred term 'Kingdom of Heaven' (rather than 'Kingdom of God') reflects Jewish reverence for the divine name. Unique to Matthew are the Sermon on the Mount in its extended form, the visit of the Magi, the flight to Egypt, many kingdom parables, and the Great Commission. The Gospel preserves essential teachings including the Beatitudes, Lord's Prayer, Golden Rule, and the command to make disciples of all nations. Church tradition attributes authorship to the apostle Matthew (also called Levi), the tax collector whom Jesus called from his booth in Capernaum. The Gospel was likely composed 70-90 CE and became the most quoted Gospel in the early church.",
