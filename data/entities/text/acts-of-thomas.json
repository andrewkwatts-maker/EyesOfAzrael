  "longDescription": "The Acts of Thomas is a 3rd-century Syriac apocryphal text narrating the missionary journey of the apostle Thomas (called 'Judas Thomas' - Judas the Twin) to India. Composed around 200-250 CE, likely in Edessa (modern Urfa, Turkey), it represents the most complete ancient account of Thomas's post-resurrection ministry. The narrative begins with the apostles casting lots to divide the world for evangelization, with India falling to Thomas who initially resists until Christ appears and sells him as a slave to a merchant named Abban, servant of the Indian king Gundaphorus. The text contains remarkable literary treasures including the 'Hymn of the Pearl' (also called 'Hymn of the Soul'), a profound allegorical poem about the soul's journey from divine origins through earthly exile to redemption. The Acts blend Christian teachings with Gnostic and encratite (extreme asceticism) elements, emphasizing celibacy as essential for salvation. Despite its legendary character, the Acts preserve genuine historical information - King Gundaphorus (Gondophares) was a real Indo-Parthian ruler (c. 20-46 CE), confirming ancient trade connections between the Mediterranean and India that would have enabled such missionary journeys.",
