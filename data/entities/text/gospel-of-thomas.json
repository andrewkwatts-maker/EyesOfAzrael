  "shortDescription": "A collection of 114 sayings attributed to Jesus, recorded by 'Didymus Judas Thomas' - one of the most significant extra-canonical Christian texts",
  "longDescription": "The Gospel of Thomas is a non-canonical sayings gospel discovered in 1945 near Nag Hammadi, Egypt, as part of a cache of Gnostic texts. Unlike the narrative Gospels, it contains no miracles, no passion narrative, and no resurrection account - only 114 logia (sayings) attributed to the 'living Jesus,' recorded by 'Didymus Judas Thomas' (Thomas the Twin). The text opens: 'These are the secret sayings which the living Jesus spoke and which Didymus Judas Thomas wrote down.' Many sayings parallel the Synoptic Gospels, while others are unique and reflect Gnostic themes of hidden knowledge and self-discovery. The dating is hotly debated - some scholars argue for an early date (50-100 CE), potentially preserving authentic Jesus traditions independent of the canonical Gospels, while others date it to the mid-2nd century. The attribution to Thomas connects with Syriac Christian tradition where Thomas held special authority. Whether preserving genuine early traditions or representing later Gnostic developments, the Gospel of Thomas profoundly impacts our understanding of early Christian diversity.",
