  "fullDescription": "The Cunning Hero of the Long Journey Home\n\nOdysseus, king of Ithaca, stands as Greek mythology's quintessential trickster-hero—a man who survives not through strength but through intelligence, adaptability, and cunning (metis). The central figure of Homer's Odyssey, his ten-year journey home from the Trojan War became Western literature's archetypal quest narrative, a story of perseverance, identity, homecoming, and the price of heroism. Where Achilles represents martial excellence, Odysseus embodies resourcefulness and the triumph of wit over force.\n\nOdysseus was born to Laertes, king of Ithaca, and Anticlea. His maternal grandfather was Autolycus, a master thief and trickster, from whom Odysseus inherited his cunning nature. He married Penelope, daughter of King Icarius of Sparta, and they had a son named Telemachus. Odysseus's kingdom of Ithaca was rocky and poor, but he loved it deeply—a love that would sustain him through years of wandering.",
