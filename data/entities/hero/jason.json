  "fullDescription": "Leader of the Argonauts and Seeker of the Golden Fleece\n\nJason, prince of Iolcus in Thessaly, led the greatest assemblage of heroes in Greek mythology on a quest to retrieve the Golden Fleece from the distant land of Colchis. His story epitomizes the heroic quest narrative—the gathering of companions, the perilous voyage to distant lands, impossible tasks overcome through divine aid, and the tragic consequences of success. Yet Jason himself remains one of mythology's most ambiguous heroes: neither the strongest warrior nor the wisest strategist, he succeeds through the help of others, particularly the sorceress Medea, and his later betrayal of her transforms him from hero to cautionary figure about the price of ambition and the danger of broken oaths.\n\nJason was born to Aeson, rightful king of Iolcus, and Polymede (or Alcimede). His uncle Pelias had usurped the throne, killing all potential rivals to secure his power. To save her infant son, Polymede faked Jason's death, mourning loudly while secretly smuggling the baby away to Mount Pelion, where the wise centaur Chiron raised him—the same Chiron who had tutored Achilles and Heracles.",
