  "shortDescription": "The wisest king of Israel, builder of the First Temple, author of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs - paradigm of divine wisdom",
  "longDescription": "King Solomon (Hebrew: Shlomo, from shalom meaning 'peace') was the son of King David and Bathsheba, and the third king of Israel's united monarchy. His reign (c. 970-931 BCE) marked the golden age of Israel's power, wealth, and wisdom. When God appeared to the young Solomon in a dream at Gibeon and offered him anything he desired, Solomon asked not for long life, wealth, or victory over enemies, but for 'an understanding heart to judge Your people, to discern between good and evil' (1 Kings 3:9). Pleased with this humble request, God granted Solomon wisdom surpassing all who came before or after, plus the wealth and honor he had not requested. This 'wisdom of Solomon' became proverbial: he composed 3,000 proverbs and 1,005 songs, spoke of trees, beasts, birds, fish, and received visitors like the Queen of Sheba who came to test his renowned wisdom. Solomon built the magnificent First Temple in Jerusalem, fulfilling his father David's dream, and established Israel as a commercial and diplomatic power. Yet his later years saw tragic compromise: his many foreign wives turned his heart toward their gods, and his heavy taxation and forced labor sowed seeds of the kingdom's eventual division. In Jewish tradition, Solomon authored three biblical books: Proverbs (wisdom for the young), Ecclesiastes (reflection in old age), and Song of Songs (love's passion in youth). The apocryphal Wisdom of Solomon and legends of the Seal of Solomon commanding demons expanded his mystical reputation. For the Epistle of James, Solomon represents the paradigm of one who asked God for wisdom and received generously (James 1:5) - 'the wisdom from above' that James urges all believers to seek.",
