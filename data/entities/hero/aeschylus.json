  "fullDescription": "Father of Tragedy - Pioneer of Greek Drama\n\nAeschylus (c. 525-456 BCE) stands as the earliest of the three great Athenian tragedians whose works survive, earning the title 'Father of Tragedy' for his revolutionary contributions to dramatic art. He transformed tragedy from a simple choral performance with a single actor into sophisticated drama, introducing the second actor and reducing the chorus to give dialogue and conflict central importance. His innovations established the fundamental structure that would define Western theater for millennia.\n\nBorn at Eleusis, the sacred site of the Mysteries, Aeschylus lived through the defining moments of Greek history. He fought at Marathon (490 BCE) against the Persian invasion - an experience he considered his greatest achievement, mentioned in his self-composed epitaph while his dramatic victories went unmentioned. He also likely fought at Salamis (480 BCE), the naval battle he would immortalize in The Persians, the only surviving Greek tragedy based on contemporary events.\n\nThe Oresteia (458 BCE)\n\nAeschylus's masterpiece is the only complete tragic trilogy to survive from antiquity. It traces the curse of the House of Atreus through three plays:\n\nAgamemnon: The victorious king returns from Troy only to be murdered by his wife Clytemnestra and her lover Aegisthus, in revenge for Agamemnon's sacrifice of their daughter Iphigenia.\n\nThe Libation Bearers (Choephoroi): Orestes, son of Agamemnon, returns from exile to avenge his father by killing his mother Clytemnestra and Aegisthus, as commanded by Apollo.\n\nThe Eumenides: Orestes is pursued by the Furies (Erinyes) for matricide until Athena establishes the court of the Areopagus in Athens, where he is tried and acquitted, transforming the Furies into the kindly Eumenides.\n\nThe trilogy explores the evolution from blood vengeance to civic justice, from the primitive law of retaliation to the democratic institutions of Athens. It represents one of the most profound meditations on justice, guilt, and divine order in Western literature.\n\nSeven Against Thebes (467 BCE)\n\nThe final play of a Theban trilogy (the earlier plays are lost), Seven Against Thebes dramatizes the mutual fratricide of Eteocles and Polynices, sons of Oedipus, fulfilling their father's curse. The play focuses on Eteocles as he assigns defenders to each of Thebes' seven gates, culminating in his recognition that he must face his own brother at the seventh gate.\n\nPrometheus Bound (date disputed, authorship questioned)\n\nThis powerful drama depicts Prometheus chained to a rock in the Caucasus as punishment for stealing fire for humanity. Defiant against Zeus's tyranny, Prometheus represents the suffering benefactor of mankind, possessing secret knowledge of Zeus's eventual overthrow. The play raises profound questions about divine justice, the price of progress, and the relationship between power and wisdom.\n\nThe Persians (472 BCE)\n\nThe earliest surviving Greek tragedy, set at the Persian court as news arrives of the catastrophic defeat at Salamis. Rather than triumphalism, Aeschylus presents the Persians with dignity and explores the hubris that led Xerxes to disaster. The ghost of Darius rises to interpret the defeat as divine punishment for overreaching.\n\nThe Suppliants (date disputed)\n\nThe fifty daughters of Danaus flee Egypt to escape forced marriage to their cousins, seeking asylum in Argos. The play explores themes of sanctuary, the rights of suppliants, and the conflict between force and persuasion.\n\nDramatic Innovations\n\n- Introduced the second actor, enabling true dramatic conflict\n- Reduced the chorus from dominant to supporting role\n- Developed elaborate costumes, masks, and stage machinery\n- Created the connected trilogy as an art form\n- Integrated music, dance, and spectacle into unified dramatic vision\n\nLegacy\n\nAeschylus reportedly wrote 70-90 plays, winning first prize at the City Dionysia thirteen times. Only seven plays survive. His influence extends through Sophocles and Euripides to Roman tragedy, Renaissance drama, and modern theater. His grave at Gela in Sicily bore an epitaph he composed himself, mentioning only his military service at Marathon - the man who revolutionized Western drama wished to be remembered as a soldier who defended Greece.",
