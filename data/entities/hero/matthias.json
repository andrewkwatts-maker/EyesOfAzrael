  "longDescription": "Saint Matthias holds a unique position among the Twelve Apostles - he was not called directly by Jesus during his earthly ministry, but was chosen by divine lot to restore the apostolic number after Judas Iscariot's betrayal and death. His selection, recorded in Acts 1:15-26, represents the first major decision of the nascent church and demonstrates early Christian understanding of divine guidance through sacred lots. Matthias was qualified by having been a witness 'from the baptism of John unto that same day that he was taken up from us' (Acts 1:22), meaning he had followed Jesus throughout his entire public ministry as one of the 120 disciples. When Peter quoted Psalm 109:8 - 'his bishoprick let another take' - the community nominated two candidates: Joseph called Barsabas (Justus) and Matthias. After prayer asking God to 'shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,' the lot fell upon Matthias. This method of divine selection connected Christian practice to Jewish precedent (Urim and Thummim, Proverbs 16:33: 'The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD'). Though Scripture records nothing further of Matthias, church tradition places his mission in Judea, Cappadocia, Ethiopia, or the Caspian Sea region. He is traditionally martyred by stoning and beheading, symbolized by the axe or halberd in iconography. His feast is celebrated on May 14 (Western) and August 9 (Eastern).",

His quiet presence from the beginning and selection when needed exemplifies the value of humble, persistent faithfulness."

  "fullDescription": "Saint Matthias, the apostle chosen by divine lot to replace Judas Iscariot after the Ascension, restoring the apostolic number to twelve. A faithful witness from the baptism of John to the resurrection, Matthias exemplifies humble discipleship that precedes public recognition. His selection through prayer and sacred lots demonstrates early Christian understanding of divine guidance and prophetic fulfillment. Traditionally martyred by axe or halberd, he is patron of alcoholics, carpenters, and tailors.",
