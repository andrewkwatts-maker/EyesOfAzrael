  "fullDescription": "The Mythographer - Author of the Bibliotheca\n\nApollodorus of Athens compiled one of antiquity's most comprehensive collections of Greek mythology. His Bibliotheca (Library) systematically preserves countless myths, genealogies, and heroic narratives that might otherwise have been lost to time. This encyclopedic work has become an indispensable reference for understanding Greek mythology, providing coherent narratives of divine genealogies, the labors of heroes, and the great epic cycles.\n\nHistorical Context\n\nApollodorus flourished during the 2nd century BCE (c. 180-120 BCE), a period when Greek scholarship reached new heights in the great library centers of Alexandria and Pergamon. He was a student of the Stoic philosopher Panaetius and the grammarian Aristarchus of Samothrace. While the attribution of the Bibliotheca to this Apollodorus is debated by modern scholars (some date the work to the 1st or 2nd century CE), the text has traditionally borne his name and represents the culmination of Hellenistic mythographical scholarship.\n\nThe Bibliotheca (Library of Greek Mythology)\n\nThe Bibliotheca is organized into three books, though the work survives incomplete, supplemented by epitomes (summaries) that preserve the lost portions:\n\nBook I: Divine Genealogies and the Titanomachy\n- Origins from Uranus and Gaia through the Titans\n- The birth and reign of Zeus\n- The Gigantomachy and Typhon's rebellion\n- Stories of Prometheus, Io, and the early gods\n\nBook II: The Heroic Genealogies\n- The lineage of Inachus and the Argive heroes\n- Perseus and his descendants\n- The labors of Heracles in exhaustive detail\n- The expedition of the Argonauts\n\nBook III: Athenian and Theban Cycles\n- The royal houses of Athens and Thebes\n- The tragic saga of Oedipus\n- The Seven Against Thebes\n- The Trojan War and its aftermath (preserved in epitome)\n\nMethodology and Significance\n\nApollodorus synthesized material from numerous sources: Homer, Hesiod, the Cyclic poets, Athenian tragedians (Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides), Hellenistic poets, and earlier mythographers. His approach was comprehensive rather than critical - he aimed to preserve variant traditions rather than resolve contradictions.\n\nThe Bibliotheca's value lies in its:\n- Systematic organization of sprawling mythological material\n- Preservation of myths known only through his account\n- Detailed genealogical information linking heroes and gods\n- Relatively neutral presentation without extensive allegorical interpretation\n\nContent Highlights\n\nThe Labors of Heracles: Apollodorus provides the most complete ancient account of all twelve labors, including:\n1. The Nemean Lion\n2. The Lernaean Hydra\n3. The Ceryneian Hind\n4. The Erymanthian Boar\n5. The Augean Stables\n6. The Stymphalian Birds\n7. The Cretan Bull\n8. The Mares of Diomedes\n9. The Belt of Hippolyta\n10. The Cattle of Geryon\n11. The Apples of the Hesperides\n12. Cerberus from the Underworld\n\nThe Trojan War: The epitome preserves crucial details about:\n- The Judgment of Paris\n- The gathering of the Greek fleet\n- Events of the war not covered in Homer\n- The wooden horse stratagem\n- The nostoi (returns) of the Greek heroes\n\nLegacy and Influence\n\nThe Bibliotheca became a primary reference for later antiquity and the Renaissance. It influenced:\n- Roman mythographers and encyclopedists\n- Medieval and Renaissance scholars rediscovering classical mythology\n- Modern mythological handbooks and reference works\n- Contemporary scholarship on Greek religion and narrative\n\nFor modern readers, Apollodorus remains the most accessible entry point into the full scope of Greek mythology, providing coherent narratives where other sources offer only fragments or allusions.",
