  "longDescription": "Saint Thaddaeus, also called Judas son of James, Lebbaeus, or Jude (not Iscariot), was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ. He is distinguished from Judas Iscariot by his patronymic 'son of James' and appears in three of the four Gospel apostle lists. His most significant moment in the Gospels occurs at the Last Supper when he asked Jesus the profound theological question: 'Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?' (John 14:22). This question about selective divine revelation became central to understanding the intimate nature of Christ's relationship with believers. According to tradition, Thaddaeus carried the Gospel eastward to Edessa where he healed King Abgar V, who had written to Jesus requesting healing. The legendary 'Image of Edessa' (Mandylion) - a miraculous image of Christ's face - is associated with this mission. Thaddaeus later journeyed to Armenia with fellow apostle Simon the Zealot, where they are venerated as the founders of Armenian Christianity. Both apostles were martyred together in Persia, with Thaddaeus traditionally killed by axe, club, or halberd. Some church traditions identify him as the author of the Epistle of Jude, which warns against false teachers and notably quotes the apocryphal Book of Enoch. His feast day is celebrated on October 28 (with Simon the Zealot) in Western Christianity and July 19 in Eastern traditions.",
