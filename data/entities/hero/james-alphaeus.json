  "shortDescription": "One of the Twelve Apostles, known as 'the Less' to distinguish from James son of Zebedee, possibly Jesus' relative and leader of the Jerusalem church",
  "longDescription": "James son of Alphaeus, called 'the Less' (Greek: ho mikros, meaning 'the younger' or 'the smaller'), was one of the Twelve Apostles chosen by Jesus. The epithet distinguishes him from James son of Zebedee (James the Greater), a more prominent apostle. Some scholars and church traditions identify him with 'James the Just,' the brother (or cousin) of the Lord who became the leader of the Jerusalem church after the Resurrection. If this identification holds, James authored the Epistle of James and presided over the Jerusalem Council (Acts 15), making momentous decisions about Gentile Christians. His mother Mary was present at the Crucifixion (Mark 15:40), suggesting a close family connection to Jesus. Traditions describe him as a Nazarite who never cut his hair, drank wine, or ate meat, spending so much time in prayer that his knees became calloused like a camel's. He was martyred c. 62 CE by being thrown from the Temple pinnacle and beaten with a fuller's club. Whether one or two persons, James represents quiet faithfulness, Jewish-Christian continuity, and the practical wisdom that faith requires works.",
