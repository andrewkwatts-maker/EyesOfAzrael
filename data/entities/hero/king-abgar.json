  "longDescription": "King Abgar V (reigned c. 4 BCE - 7 CE and 13-50 CE), called Ukkama ('the Black'), was the ruler of the Kingdom of Osroene centered at Edessa (modern Sanliurfa, Turkey). According to Syriac tradition preserved in the Doctrine of Addai and recorded by the church historian Eusebius, Abgar suffered from a severe illness (possibly leprosy) and, having heard of Jesus's miraculous healings, sent a letter to Christ requesting healing. Jesus replied with a letter blessing those who believed without seeing and promising that after his ascension, a disciple would come to heal and teach. After Pentecost, the apostle Thaddaeus (called Addai in Syriac) was sent to Edessa, where he healed King Abgar and converted him to Christianity. Some versions of the legend include the miraculous 'Image of Edessa' (Mandylion) - Christ's image miraculously imprinted on cloth and sent to Abgar. Abgar became the first king to make Christianity his personal faith, though official adoption would come centuries later. The Abgar correspondence was once believed genuine, preserved in church archives, though modern scholars consider it legendary. Nevertheless, it attests to very early Christianity in Edessa and the East.",
