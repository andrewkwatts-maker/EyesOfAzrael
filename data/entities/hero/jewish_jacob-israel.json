  "shortDescription": "Patriarch who wrestled with God and was renamed Israel; received the vision of angels ascending and descending at Bethel; father of the twelve tribes",
  "fullDescription": "Jacob (Hebrew: Ya'akov, meaning 'heel-grabber' or 'supplanter') is one of the three great patriarchs of Israel, grandson of Abraham and son of Isaac. His life story represents one of the most dramatic spiritual transformations in Scripture - from a deceiver who stole his brother's birthright to Israel ('one who strives with God'), the father of twelve sons who became the twelve tribes. Two visionary encounters define Jacob's spiritual journey: at Bethel, he saw the famous 'ladder' (sullam) with angels ascending and descending, and God standing above confirming the Abrahamic covenant; at Peniel, he wrestled all night with a mysterious divine being who wounded his hip but blessed him with the new name Israel. Jesus specifically referenced Jacob's ladder vision when speaking to Nathanael (Bartholomew), declaring that he would see 'heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man' (John 1:51), identifying himself as the true connection between heaven and earth that Jacob's ladder symbolized. The transformation from 'Jacob' (deceiver) to 'Israel' (one who prevails with God) prefigures the transformation Jesus saw in Nathanael - 'an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile' - a true descendant who embodies Israel's spiritual rather than merely genetic identity.",

Jacob's ladder is understood in Kabbalah as representing the sefirot and the path of spiritual ascent.",
