  "longDescription": "Saint John the Evangelist, known as the Beloved Disciple, occupies a unique place among the apostles as the one who leaned on Jesus' breast at the Last Supper and to whom Christ entrusted His mother Mary at the cross. Along with his brother James, John was called 'Boanerges' (Son of Thunder) by Jesus, suggesting his passionate nature. Traditionally credited with authoring the Gospel of John, three epistles, and the Book of Revelation, John's writings present the most theological and mystical vision of Christianity. His Gospel begins with the profound Logos theology ('In the beginning was the Word'), identifies Jesus as the Light of the World, and emphasizes divine love as the central reality of existence. His first epistle contains the revolutionary declaration 'God is love' (1 John 4:8). Exiled to the island of Patmos under Emperor Domitian, John received the apocalyptic visions recorded in Revelation, describing the cosmic battle between good and evil, the Four Living Creatures, the Lamb with Seven Eyes, and the heavenly Jerusalem descending as a bride. According to tradition, John was the only apostle to die a natural death, living into extreme old age in Ephesus where he cared for the Virgin Mary and trained church leaders including Polycarp. A famous legend tells of him surviving a poisoned chalice unharmed, which became his iconographic symbol. His feast day is December 27, and he is represented by the eagle, symbolizing the soaring heights of his theological vision.",

As the 'eagle' among evangelists, his writings soar to mystical heights while remaining grounded in eyewitness testimony."
