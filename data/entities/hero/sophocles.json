  "fullDescription": "Master of Attic Tragedy - Perfecter of Dramatic Art\n\nSophocles (c. 496-406 BCE) represents the pinnacle of Greek tragic drama, winning more victories at the City Dionysia than any other playwright. Born at Colonus near Athens into a wealthy family, he lived through the golden age of Athenian democracy and died just before its final defeat in the Peloponnesian War. His ninety years spanned the greatest achievements of Greek civilization, and his art both reflected and shaped that remarkable era.\n\nSophocles reportedly won his first victory at the Dionysia in 468 BCE, defeating the aging Aeschylus. Over his career, he won first prize at least eighteen times (possibly twenty-four) and never placed lower than second. He wrote approximately 123 plays, of which only seven tragedies survive complete, along with a substantial fragment of a satyr play.\n\nDramatic Innovations\n\nSophocles transformed Greek tragedy through several crucial innovations:\n\n- Introduced the third actor, allowing more complex interactions and plot structures\n- Abandoned the connected trilogy in favor of self-contained single plays\n- Introduced painted scenery (skenographia)\n- Increased the chorus from twelve to fifteen members while further reducing its dramatic role\n- Perfected the technique of dramatic irony, where the audience knows what characters do not\n\nOedipus Rex (c. 429 BCE)\n\nAristotle's Poetics holds up Oedipus Rex (Oedipus the King) as the model tragedy. Oedipus, king of Thebes, investigates the murder of his predecessor Laius to lift a plague from his city. His relentless pursuit of truth reveals that he himself is the murderer - and that Laius was his father, making his wife Jocasta his mother. The play is a masterpiece of dramatic structure, with every element contributing to the catastrophic recognition (anagnorisis) and reversal (peripeteia).\n\nThe Theban Plays\n\nThough not written as a trilogy, three of Sophocles' surviving plays treat the Theban saga:\n\nOedipus Rex: The discovery of Oedipus's true identity and crimes\n\nOedipus at Colonus (401 BCE, posthumous): The aged, blind Oedipus, guided by his daughter Antigone, arrives at Colonus (Sophocles' birthplace) where he will die and become a protective hero for Athens.\n\nAntigone (c. 441 BCE): After Oedipus's sons kill each other, Creon forbids burial of the traitor Polynices. Antigone defies the decree to honor divine law over human law, leading to her death and the destruction of Creon's family.\n\nElectra (date uncertain)\n\nSophocles' treatment of Orestes' return to avenge Agamemnon focuses on Electra, who has endured years of suffering while waiting for her brother. The play explores the psychological toll of hatred and the moral ambiguity of divinely commanded revenge.\n\nAjax (c. 450-440 BCE)\n\nThe earliest of the surviving plays depicts the madness and suicide of Ajax, the greatest Greek warrior after Achilles, who was denied Achilles' armor. The play examines heroic honor, the fragility of greatness, and the obligation to bury even enemies.\n\nThe Women of Trachis (date uncertain)\n\nDeianira, wife of Heracles, inadvertently kills her husband by sending him a robe soaked in what she believes is a love charm but is actually the poisoned blood of the centaur Nessus.\n\nPhiloctetes (409 BCE)\n\nStranded on Lemnos for ten years with a festering wound, Philoctetes possesses the bow of Heracles, necessary for Troy's fall. Odysseus and Neoptolemus must retrieve him, raising questions about truth, manipulation, and moral integrity.\n\nThemes and Vision\n\nSophocles' tragedies explore the tension between human will and divine order. His heroes are defined by their excellence (arete) and their steadfast adherence to their own nature, even when this leads to destruction. They do not break; they remain true to themselves against forces they cannot overcome.\n\nKey themes include:\n- The limits of human knowledge and the danger of certainty\n- The conflict between divine law and human law\n- The isolation of the hero\n- The terrible cost of moral integrity\n- The inscrutability of the gods\n\nLegacy\n\nSophocles served Athens as a general, a treasurer, and a priest. He reportedly welcomed the cult of Asclepius to Athens and was honored after death as the hero Dexion. His influence on Western literature is immeasurable - Freud named his most famous complex after Oedipus, and the Sophoclean hero remains an archetype of tragic dignity facing an indifferent universe.",
