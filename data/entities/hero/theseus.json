  "fullDescription": "Founding Hero of Athens and Slayer of the Minotaur\n\nTheseus stands as Athens' greatest hero—a culture-bringer who transformed the city from a collection of settlements into a unified polis. His story combines monster-slaying adventures with political unification, making him both mythic warrior and civic founder. Like Heracles, Theseus performed a series of monster-slaying labors, but where Heracles served others, Theseus civilized the land for Athens' benefit. His most famous exploit—entering the Labyrinth to slay the Minotaur—represents the triumph of Athenian intelligence over brute force.\n\nTheseus's parentage was dual and ambiguous. His mother Aethra was visited in a single night by two fathers: Aegeus, mortal king of Athens, and Poseidon, god of the sea. This double paternity meant Theseus could claim both human kingship and divine heritage, depending on circumstance—a flexibility he exploited throughout his life.",
