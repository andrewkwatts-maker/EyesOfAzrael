  "longDescription": "Nagarjuna (c. 150-250 CE) is one of the most important philosophers in Buddhist history, founding the Madhyamaka (Middle Way) school that became the philosophical foundation of Mahayana Buddhism. His name 'Naga-arjuna' means 'noble serpent,' derived from the legend of his encounter with the nagas (serpent deities) who invited him to their underwater palace and presented him with the Prajnaparamita Sutras (Perfection of Wisdom texts), which the Buddha had taught but the world was not ready to receive. Born to a Brahmin family in South India, he mastered the entire Tripitaka in 90 days. His revolutionary teachings on emptiness (shunyata) and masterwork Mulamadhyamakakarika profoundly influenced all subsequent Buddhist thought. He served as abbot of Nalanda monastery, advisor to kings, and was also known as an alchemist. According to legend, he achieved immortality through alchemy and meditation but compassionately offered his life when a prince's destiny required it, being killed only by kusha grass—the one substance that could harm him. Considered an emanation of Manjushri, he is revered as the 'Second Buddha' for reviving and clarifying the Buddha's teachings.",
