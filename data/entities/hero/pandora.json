  "fullDescription": "The First Woman - All-Gifted Bearer of the Jar of Evils\n\nPandora was the first mortal woman, crafted by Hephaestus on Zeus's command as a 'beautiful evil' to punish humanity for receiving Prometheus's gift of fire. Her name means 'All-Gifted' (from pan 'all' + doron 'gift'), for each god bestowed upon her a gift - beauty, grace, cunning, and a treacherous heart. When she opened the jar (pithos) she carried, all evils escaped into the world, leaving only Hope (Elpis) trapped within.\n\nThe Prometheus-Pandora Myth in Works and Days\n\nHesiod presents the Pandora myth as the origin of human suffering. After Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to humanity, Zeus devised a punishment that would affect all mortals forever:\n\n'For from her is the race of women and female kind: of her is the deadly race and tribe of women who live amongst mortal men to their great trouble, no helpmeets in hateful poverty, but only in wealth.'\n\nThis passage reflects the deeply patriarchal perspective of archaic Greek society, presenting woman herself as punishment for male transgression.\n\nThe Creation of Pandora\n\nZeus commanded Hephaestus (god of crafts) to mold earth and water into the form of a woman. The gods then adorned her:\n\n- Athena dressed her in silvery garments and taught her weaving\n- Aphrodite shed grace and painful desire upon her\n- Hermes placed in her a shameless mind and deceitful nature\n- The Graces and Persuasion gave her golden necklaces\n- The Horae crowned her with spring flowers\n\nHermes named her Pandora, 'because all they who dwelt on Olympus gave each a gift, a plague to men who eat bread.'\n\nThe Opening of the Jar\n\nZeus sent Pandora as a 'gift' to Epimetheus ('Afterthought'), brother of Prometheus. Despite his brother's warning never to accept gifts from the gods, Epimetheus - true to his name - accepted Pandora only to realize his mistake afterward.\n\nPandora brought with her a great jar (pithos). When she lifted its lid, all the evils it contained scattered among humanity:\n\n'But the woman took off the great lid of the jar with her hands and scattered all these and caused sorrow and mischief to men. Only Hope remained there in an unbreakable home within under the rim of the great jar, and did not fly out.'\n\nThe Meaning of Hope\n\nThe fact that Hope (Elpis) alone remained trapped has puzzled interpreters. Is this merciful (humans retain hope) or cruel (they cannot even access hope)? Various interpretations include:\n\n1. Hope remains available to humans, a comfort amid suffering\n2. Hope is another evil - 'blind hope' that prolongs suffering\n3. Hope is trapped to show that true escape from suffering is impossible\n4. Hope's containment prevents humans from knowing their doomed futures\n\nTheogony Version\n\nIn the Theogony, Hesiod presents a briefer account focused on Pandora as the prototype of all women, emphasizing the 'evil' of the female sex from the male perspective of archaic poetry. This version lacks the jar narrative.\n\nLater Tradition\n\nThe Greek word pithos (large storage jar) was mistranslated as pyxis (box) by Erasmus in the 16th century, giving us 'Pandora's Box.' The myth has become a universal metaphor for unintended consequences of curiosity or well-meaning but foolish actions.\n\nModern Interpretations\n\nFeminist scholars have reread the Pandora myth as patriarchal anxiety about female agency and sexuality. Pandora's 'crime' - curiosity - is also the virtue that drives human knowledge. She represents both the dangers that Greek men projected onto women and the indomitable human spirit that opens forbidden containers despite consequences.",
