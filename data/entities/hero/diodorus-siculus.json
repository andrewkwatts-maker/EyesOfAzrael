  "fullDescription": "The Universal Historian - Compiler of Divine Genealogies\n\nDiodorus Siculus (c. 90-30 BCE) composed the most ambitious universal history of antiquity, the Bibliotheca historica (Library of History), originally comprising 40 books that spanned from mythological origins to the campaigns of Julius Caesar. Though only 15 books survive intact (Books 1-5 and 11-20), with fragments of the others, his work preserves invaluable mythological material from now-lost sources. For the study of ancient mythology, Diodorus is indispensable: Books 1-6 systematically cover the mythological traditions of Egypt, Assyria, Ethiopia, Greece, and the barbarian nations.\n\nLife and Method\n\nDiodorus was born in Agyrium, Sicily, hence his cognomen 'Siculus' (the Sicilian). He traveled extensively throughout the Mediterranean world, visiting Egypt, Rome, and much of the Greek-speaking East. He claims to have spent thirty years researching and writing his universal history, consulting libraries, interviewing informants, and visiting the sites he describes.\n\nDiodorus explicitly states his method: he sought to compile the works of earlier historians into a single comprehensive narrative. While later scholars sometimes criticized him as a mere compiler, this very characteristic makes him invaluable - he preserves extensive material from authors whose works are now lost, including Hecataeus of Abdera on Egypt, Ctesias on Persia and India, and Ephorus on Greek history.\n\nBook 1: Egyptian Mythology and Religion\n\nThe first book is entirely devoted to Egypt and constitutes one of our most important sources for Egyptian religion as understood by Greeks. Diodorus covers:\n\n- The Egyptian cosmogony and the origins of the gods\n- The reign of Osiris and his civilizing mission\n- The murder of Osiris by Typhon (Set) and the vengeance of Horus\n- The worship of sacred animals and its philosophical rationale\n- The deification of kings and the Egyptian concept of immortality\n- The Seven Wonders and the architecture of Egypt\n\nDiodorus employs euhemeristic interpretation - the theory that gods were originally human kings and heroes later deified. He presents Osiris as a historical king who introduced agriculture and civilization, then was murdered by his brother and posthumously worshipped as a god.\n\nBook 2: Assyria, Babylon, India, Scythia, Arabia\n\nThis book draws heavily on Ctesias's lost Persica and preserves myths and legends from the Near East:\n\n- The founding of Nineveh and the reign of Ninus and Semiramis\n- The hanging gardens of Babylon\n- Mythological geography of India, including tales of marvels\n- Scythian customs and the Amazon warriors\n- Arabian mythology and the phoenix\n\nBook 3: Ethiopia, Libya, Amazons, Atlantis\n\nDiodorus presents fascinating material on African mythology and the controversial account of Atlantis:\n\n- Ethiopian gods and their relation to Egyptian religion\n- The Libyan Amazons (distinct from the Asian Amazons)\n- The origins of Dionysus and his campaigns\n- Atlantis and the Atlantioi (drawing on sources beyond Plato)\n\nBook 4: Greek Mythology - Dionysus, Heracles, the Argonauts\n\nThe most extensive treatment of Greek heroic mythology:\n\n- The birth, travels, and apotheosis of Dionysus\n- The twelve labors of Heracles and his deification\n- The voyage of the Argonauts for the Golden Fleece\n- Theseus and the Minotaur\n- The Seven against Thebes\n- Orpheus and the establishment of mysteries\n\nDiodorus provides rationalized versions alongside traditional accounts, allowing comparison between mythological and euhemeristic interpretations.\n\nBook 5: Islands and Western Mediterranean\n\nMythology of the Mediterranean islands and western regions:\n\n- Sicilian myths and the cult of Demeter and Persephone\n- Cretan mythology, including Zeus's birth and the Minotaur\n- The mythology of Rhodes and the Telchines\n- Samothracian mysteries and the Cabiri\n- Celtic and Iberian mythological traditions\n\nBook 6: Mythological Theology (Fragmentary)\n\nThe fragments of Book 6 show Diodorus engaging with the theological interpretations of myth, including the theories of Euhemerus himself, whose Sacred History (now lost) proposed that the gods were deified kings.\n\nMethodological Significance\n\nDiodorus's approach to mythology reflects the intellectual currents of his Hellenistic age:\n\nEuhemerism: Following Euhemerus, Diodorus often interprets myths as distorted history - gods were originally human benefactors, culture heroes, or powerful kings whom grateful populations deified.\n\nComparative Mythology: Diodorus consistently identifies gods across cultures - Osiris with Dionysus, Isis with Demeter, Horus with Apollo. This interpretatio Graeca preserves evidence for ancient comparative religion.\n\nUniversalism: By weaving diverse mythological traditions into a single narrative, Diodorus implicitly argues for the unity of human religious experience - all peoples have gods, creation stories, and heroes.\n\nLegacy\n\nDiodorus was widely read throughout antiquity and the Byzantine period. His work influenced later universal historians and preserved material that would otherwise be completely lost. For modern scholars, the Bibliotheca historica remains essential for:\n\n- Egyptian religion as perceived by Greeks\n- Lost historiographical traditions\n- Rationalist approaches to mythology\n- Comparative mythology in antiquity\n- The mythology of regions outside mainland Greece",
