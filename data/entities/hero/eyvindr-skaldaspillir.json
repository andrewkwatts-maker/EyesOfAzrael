  "fullDescription": "The Plagiarist of Poets - Court Poet of Norwegian Kings\n\nEyvindr sk치ldaspillir Finnsson served as court poet to the Norwegian kings H치kon the Good and H치kon Jarl in the 10th century. His nickname 'sk치ldaspillir' (Plagiarist or Spoiler of Poets) reflects his practice of reworking earlier poems, particularly those of the legendary skald Bragi Boddason. Yet this dismissive epithet obscures Eyvindr's genuine achievements: his H치leygjatal traced the Norwegian royal line back to divine origins, establishing a model of genealogical poetry that served political as well as literary purposes.\n\nHistorical Context\n\nEyvindr was born around 915 CE into a prominent Norwegian family. His father Finnr was the son of Haraldr of Rogaland, connecting Eyvindr to the broader network of Norwegian nobility. He flourished during a pivotal period in Norwegian history, serving two of the most significant rulers of the 10th century.\n\nHis primary patron was H치kon the Good (H치kon g칩칧i), the Christian-raised king who attempted to introduce Christianity to Norway but ultimately allowed the continuation of pagan sacrifice. Eyvindr's poetry for H치kon includes the H치konarm치l, a funeral poem that stands among the masterworks of skaldic literature. Later, Eyvindr served H치kon Jarl (Jarl H치kon of Hla칧ir), the powerful pagan ruler who dominated Norway in the late 10th century.\n\nThe epithet 'sk치ldaspillir' - variously translated as 'Plagiarist of Poets,' 'Spoiler of Skalds,' or 'Poet-Despoiler' - indicates that Eyvindr drew heavily on earlier compositions, particularly those attributed to Bragi Boddason and the anonymous Eir칤ksm치l. In the oral-poetic culture of the Vikings, such borrowing occupied an ambiguous position: it could demonstrate mastery of tradition while risking accusations of unoriginality.\n\nH치konarm치l (Speech of H치kon)\n\nEyvindr's most celebrated work is the H치konarm치l, composed as a memorial for King H치kon the Good after his death at the Battle of Fitjar (c. 961 CE). The poem describes H치kon's reception in Valhalla, where Odin sends the valkyries G칬ndul and Sk칬gul to choose the fallen king and bring him to the hall of the slain.\n\nThe poem's structure consciously parallels the earlier Eir칤ksm치l, composed for Eir칤kr Bloodaxe - hence part of Eyvindr's reputation as a 'plagiarist.' Yet Eyvindr transforms his model significantly. Where Eir칤ksm치l presents a straightforward welcome to Valhalla, H치konarm치l includes a profound meditation on loss. The poem concludes with lines that acknowledge the passing of an era:\n\n'Cattle die, kinsmen die,\nland and realm lie waste;\nsince H치kon has gone to the heathen gods,\nmany a host is enslaved.'\n\nThis ending, echoing the wisdom poetry of the H치vam치l, elevates the conventional praise poem into genuine elegy. H치kon, though Christian-raised, is received in the pagan afterlife - a detail that may reflect the religious tensions of the period or simply Eyvindr's adherence to traditional poetic form.\n\nH치leygjatal (Enumeration of the Hla칧ir Lords)\n\nEyvindr's other major surviving work is the H치leygjatal, composed for H치kon Jarl. This genealogical poem traces the jarl's ancestry back through thirty generations to the god Odin himself, establishing divine legitimacy for the Hla칧ir dynasty.\n\nThe poem's title echoes the earlier Ynglingatal by the skald 룕칩칧칩lfr of Hvinir, which traced the Swedish Yngling dynasty to the god Freyr. Again Eyvindr works within established tradition, adapting a genealogical framework to serve a different dynasty. The H치leygjatal thus demonstrates how skaldic poetry served political purposes - legitimating rule through divine ancestry.\n\nOnly fragments of H치leygjatal survive, preserved primarily in Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda and in saga quotations. These fragments reveal the standard techniques of genealogical verse: each ruler receives brief commemoration, with attention to the manner of death and succession. The accumulation of names and deaths creates a sense of dynastic continuity reaching back to mythological time.\n\nDivine Genealogy and Royal Legitimacy\n\nEyvindr's genealogical poetry illustrates a crucial function of skaldic verse: the establishment of legitimate rule through divine descent. By tracing the Hla칧ir jarls to Odin, Eyvindr provided mythological sanction for political authority. This pattern appears throughout Norse political culture:\n\n- The Swedish Ynglings claimed descent from Freyr\n- The Danish Scyldings traced their line to legendary Scyld\n- Norwegian dynasties claimed various divine ancestors\n\nThe skald who composed such genealogies served as both poet and propagandist, using verbal art to construct political legitimacy. The intricate form of skaldic verse - with its interlocking sounds and complex kennings - made such poems difficult to alter, preserving the claimed genealogy across generations of oral transmission.\n\nOther Works\n\nBeyond these major compositions, Eyvindr is credited with various lausav칤sur (occasional verses) preserved in kings' sagas. These shorter poems comment on specific events or express personal sentiments. While less ambitious than the formal dr치pur, they reveal the skald's personality and his relationship with his patrons.\n\nLegacy\n\nEyvindr's reputation has suffered from the 'sk치ldaspillir' nickname, yet his surviving poetry demonstrates genuine artistry within the constraints of a highly traditional form. His H치konarm치l transforms borrowed structure into authentic elegy, while his H치leygjatal established a model for dynastic legitimation through divine genealogy.\n\nThe very practice that earned Eyvindr his nickname - reworking earlier compositions - reflects the fundamentally traditional nature of skaldic art. Innovation within tradition, rather than radical originality, defined Norse poetic achievement. Eyvindr's skill lay in adapting inherited forms to new contexts and patrons while maintaining the technical excellence expected of court poetry.\n\nSnorri Sturluson quotes Eyvindr extensively in the Prose Edda, treating him as an authority on mythological matters alongside other major skalds. This preservation testifies to Eyvindr's significance in the skaldic tradition, regardless of the derogatory implications of his nickname.",
