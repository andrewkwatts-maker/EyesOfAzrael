  "fullDescription": "The Divine Musician, Prophet of the Mysteries\n\nThe greatest musician the world has ever known, Orpheus was born of divine and muse parentage—either Apollo himself or the Thracian king Oeagrus, and the Muse Calliope. His music could charm beasts, move stones, and even sway the lords of death. His tragic descent to the Underworld for his beloved Eurydice remains one of mythology's most poignant tales of love and loss.\n\nOrpheus's life story explores the transcendent power of art, the depths of love and grief, and the thin boundary between the living and the dead. His journey to the Underworld—the katabasis—and his ultimate failure despite divine favor present one of mythology's most profound meditations on human limitation and loss.",
