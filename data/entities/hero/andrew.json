  "shortDescription": "First apostle called by Jesus, brother of Simon Peter, patron of fishermen and missionaries, martyred on an X-shaped cross",
  "longDescription": "Andrew (Greek: Andreas, meaning 'manly' or 'courageous') was a fisherman from Bethsaida in Galilee who became the first disciple called by Jesus Christ, earning him the title 'Protokletos' (First-Called). Originally a disciple of John the Baptist, Andrew immediately recognized Jesus as the Messiah and brought his brother Simon Peter to meet him, establishing his defining characteristic: bringing others to Christ. Throughout the Gospels, Andrew appears as the bridge-builder, presenting to Jesus the boy with five loaves and two fish at the feeding of the 5,000, and introducing Greek seekers who wished to see Jesus. After Pentecost, tradition holds that Andrew preached extensively throughout the Black Sea region, Scythia (modern Ukraine/Russia), and Greece. He was martyred in Patras, Greece, around 60 CE, reportedly on an X-shaped cross (crux decussata) at his own request, feeling unworthy to die on the same shape of cross as Christ. His relics were distributed across Christendom, making him patron saint of Scotland, Russia, Greece, and Romania. Andrew represents the humble, practical faith of a fisherman who became a fisher of men.",
