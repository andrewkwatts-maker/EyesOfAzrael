  "fullDescription": "The Invincible Warrior of the Trojan War\n\nAchilles, son of the mortal king Peleus and the sea-nymph Thetis, stands as the greatest warrior in Greek mythology. His story embodies the tragic hero archetype—a man of unparalleled martial prowess whose very invincibility becomes the stage for his doom. The central figure of Homer's Iliad, Achilles chose eternal glory over a long, peaceful life, and his choice reverberates through Western literature as the quintessential expression of heroic values and their terrible cost.\n\nAchilles was born to Peleus, king of the Myrmidons in Phthia, and Thetis, a Nereid (sea-nymph) of extraordinary beauty. The gods had once desired Thetis, but when the Titan Prometheus revealed a prophecy that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father, Zeus arranged her marriage to a mortal. This ensured the child would be merely human, not a threat to divine order.",
