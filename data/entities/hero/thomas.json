  "longDescription": "Saint Thomas, called Didymus (the Twin), stands as one of the most theologically significant of the Twelve Apostles. Known as 'Doubting Thomas' for demanding physical proof of Christ's resurrection, his story represents the journey from skepticism to the deepest faith. When Jesus appeared and invited Thomas to touch his wounds, Thomas uttered the most explicit declaration of Christ's divinity in the Gospels: 'My Lord and my God' (John 20:28). Yet Thomas was no mere doubter - when Jesus announced his intention to return to Judea where enemies sought his life, it was Thomas who said, 'Let us also go, that we may die with him' (John 11:16), displaying courage that preceded his famous doubt. According to ancient tradition, Thomas traveled further than any apostle, bringing Christianity to Parthia, Persia, and ultimately India, where the Mar Thoma Christians of Kerala trace their origins directly to his mission in 52 CE. His martyrdom by spear at Mylapore (modern Chennai) around 72 CE parallels the wounds he once demanded to see, completing his journey from doubt to ultimate witness.",

  "fullDescription": "Saint Thomas, called Didymus (the Twin), stands as one of the most theologically significant of the Twelve Apostles. Known as 'Doubting Thomas' for demanding physical proof of Christ's resurrection, his story represents the journey from skepticism to the deepest faith. When Jesus appeared and invited Thomas to touch his wounds, Thomas uttered the most explicit declaration of Christ's divinity in the Gospels: 'My Lord and my God' (John 20:28). Yet Thomas was no mere doubter - when Jesus announced his intention to return to Judea where enemies sought his life, it was Thomas who said, 'Let us also go, that we may die with him' (John 11:16), displaying courage that preceded his famous doubt. According to ancient tradition, Thomas traveled further than any apostle, bringing Christianity to Parthia, Persia, and ultimately India, where the Mar Thoma Christians of Kerala trace their origins directly to his mission in 52 CE. His martyrdom by spear at Mylapore (modern Chennai) around 72 CE parallels the wounds he once demanded to see, completing his journey from doubt to ultimate witness.",

Thomas' story is deeply rooted in Jewish epistemology - his questioning reflects not faithlessness but the Jewish value of honest wrestling with God."
