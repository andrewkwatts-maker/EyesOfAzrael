  "fullDescription": "The Philosopher of the Stage - Innovative Psychological Tragedian\n\nEuripides (c. 480-406 BCE) was the youngest and most controversial of the three great Athenian tragedians. While Aeschylus established tragedy and Sophocles perfected it, Euripides transformed and questioned it. His psychological depth, skeptical treatment of the gods, sympathetic portrayal of women and slaves, and innovative dramatic techniques made him both the most criticized playwright of his time and the most influential afterward.\n\nBorn on Salamis (according to tradition, on the very day of the famous battle), Euripides was reportedly associated with the intellectual movements of fifth-century Athens - philosophy, sophistry, and natural science. Ancient sources connect him with Anaxagoras, Protagoras, and Socrates, though these connections may be exaggerated. What is certain is that his plays reflect the questioning spirit of the Athenian Enlightenment.\n\nEuripides won only four victories at the City Dionysia during his lifetime (plus one posthumously), far fewer than Aeschylus or Sophocles. Yet he wrote approximately 90 plays, of which 18 tragedies and one satyr play survive - more than any other Greek tragedian. His relative lack of success in competition may reflect how his innovations disturbed contemporary audiences, while the large number of surviving plays indicates his enormous popularity in later antiquity.\n\nMedea (431 BCE)\n\nPerhaps Euripides' most powerful tragedy, Medea presents the foreign sorceress who helped Jason win the Golden Fleece, only to be abandoned when he seeks a politically advantageous marriage. Medea's revenge - killing Jason's new bride, the king, and her own children - is presented with such psychological complexity that audiences both condemn and understand her. The play revolutionized the portrayal of women's inner lives and the destructive potential of spurned passion.\n\nThe Bacchae (405 BCE, posthumous)\n\nEuripides' final masterpiece, produced after his death, dramatizes Dionysus's return to Thebes to establish his worship. When King Pentheus resists, Dionysus drives the women of Thebes mad, and Pentheus's own mother Agave tears him apart in Bacchic frenzy. The play explores the irresistible power of the irrational, the danger of denying fundamental aspects of human nature, and the ambiguous nature of divine blessing.\n\nHippolytus (428 BCE)\n\nPhaedra, wife of Theseus, falls in love with her stepson Hippolytus, a devoted follower of Artemis who has rejected Aphrodite. When Hippolytus rejects her, Phaedra's suicide and false accusation lead to his destruction. The play won first prize and explores the devastating conflict between desire and purity, Aphrodite and Artemis.\n\nIphigenia Plays\n\nEuripides treated the sacrifice of Iphigenia in two surviving plays:\n\nIphigenia at Aulis (405 BCE, posthumous): Agamemnon must sacrifice his daughter to gain favorable winds for Troy. The play examines the corruption of heroic values and the horror of using religion to justify murder.\n\nIphigenia in Tauris (c. 414-412 BCE): Iphigenia, miraculously saved by Artemis, serves as a priestess among the Taurians. When Orestes arrives, the siblings recognize each other and escape together. This romantic adventure-tragedy influenced later comedy and romance.\n\nOther Major Works\n\nElectra (c. 420-410 BCE): A grittier, more psychological treatment of Orestes' revenge than Aeschylus or Sophocles, questioning the morality of matricide.\n\nHeracles (c. 416 BCE): Heracles returns from the underworld to save his family, only to be driven mad by Hera and murder them himself.\n\nTrojan Women (415 BCE): The aftermath of Troy's fall, depicting the suffering of Hecuba, Andromache, and Cassandra - a powerful anti-war statement.\n\nHelen (412 BCE): A revisionist treatment where the 'real' Helen never went to Troy - only a phantom.\n\nOrestes (408 BCE): A sensational treatment of events after the matricide, with Orestes, Electra, and Pylades taking Helen hostage.\n\nInnovations and Characteristics\n\n- Psychological realism: Characters driven by recognizable human emotions rather than heroic archetypes\n- Rationalist critique: Questioning of traditional religion and divine justice\n- Sympathy for the marginalized: Women, slaves, foreigners portrayed with dignity\n- Rhetorical debates (agon): Characters argue like sophists, presenting opposing viewpoints\n- Deus ex machina: Gods appearing to resolve otherwise insoluble conflicts\n- Romantic and melodramatic plots: Recognition scenes, narrow escapes, exotic settings\n- Musical innovation: More elaborate and emotionally intense choral odes\n\nLegacy\n\nEuripides left Athens near the end of his life for the court of Macedon, where he died in 406 BCE. Sophocles reportedly dressed his chorus in mourning at the news. In the fourth century and Hellenistic period, Euripides became the most performed and quoted tragedian. His influence on New Comedy, Roman tragedy, and ultimately Renaissance and modern drama is immeasurable. Aristotle called him 'the most tragic of poets' for his ability to move audiences to pity and fear.",
