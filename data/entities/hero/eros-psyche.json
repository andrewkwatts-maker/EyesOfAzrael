  "fullDescription": "The myth of Eros (Cupid in Roman tradition) and Psyche tells the story of a mortal woman whose beauty\nrivaled that of Aphrodite and the god of love who fell in love with her. Through trials, betrayal, and redemption,\nPsyche's journey from mortal to goddess represents the soul's ascent to divine love and immortality.\n\nPsyche was a king's daughter whose beauty was so extraordinary that people worshiped her instead of Aphrodite.\nEnraged by this, the goddess commanded her son Eros to make Psyche fall in love with the most despicable creature.\nHowever, when Eros saw Psyche, he accidentally pricked himself with his own arrow and fell deeply in love with her.\n\nFollowing an oracle's cryptic prophecy, Psyche was left on a mountaintop to marry a mysterious being. The West\nWind carried her to a magnificent palace where invisible servants attended her. Each night, her husband visited her in\ndarkness, forbidding her to see his face. He warned that if she looked upon him, they would be separated forever.",
