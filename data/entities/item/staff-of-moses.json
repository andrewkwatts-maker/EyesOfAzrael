The staff's ability to bring forth water represents divine providence and the Torah itself (water as metaphor for Torah in Jewish tradition).",
      "culturalSignificance": "The Staff of Moses remains one of Judaism's most iconic symbols of divine power and deliverance. It appears in Passover Haggadot, synagogue art, and Jewish mystical texts. In Kabbalah, the staff represents the Sefirah of Gevurah (divine strength/judgment) tempered by Chesed (mercy), unified in Tiferet (beauty/balance) through Moses as the perfect mediator."
