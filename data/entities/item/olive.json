  "fullDescription": "The olive tree was sacred to Athena, goddess of wisdom and strategic warfare, and stood as the supreme symbol of peace, prosperity, and civilization in ancient Greece. The olive's gift of oil—for light, food, and anointing—represented the triumph of wisdom over brute force and the blessings of cultivated life over barbarism.\n\nIn the contest for patronage of Athens, Poseidon struck the Acropolis with his trident and brought forth a salt-water spring, while Athena struck the rock and produced the first olive tree. The Athenians judged Athena's gift superior—the olive tree provided food, oil for lamps, wood for building, and economic prosperity through trade. This myth established the olive as the foundation of Athenian civilization and Athena's wisdom as more valuable than Poseidon's might.\n\nThe original olive tree that Athena created stood on the Acropolis and was zealously protected. When Persians burned Athens in 480 BCE and destroyed the sacred olive, miraculously a new shoot sprouted from the charred stump the very next day—a sign of Athens' resilience and Athena's eternal protection.",
