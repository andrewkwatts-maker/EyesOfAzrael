  "fullDescription": "The Urim and Thummim (Hebrew: 'Lights and Perfections' or 'Revelation and Truth') are among the most mysterious sacred objects in biblical tradition. Housed within the High Priest's breastplate (choshen), they served as instruments for seeking divine guidance on matters of national importance. Their exact nature and method of operation remain unknown - they may have been stones, dice-like objects, or sacred lots that gave yes/no or complex answers. Scripture describes them being used to seek God's will on military campaigns (1 Samuel 28:6), to identify guilty parties (1 Samuel 14:41-42), and for guidance on important decisions (Numbers 27:21). The theological principle underlying their use was that expressed in Proverbs 16:33: 'The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.' This same principle governed the casting of lots to select Matthias as the apostle to replace Judas Iscariot (Acts 1:26). Though Matthias was not chosen through Urim and Thummim specifically, the practice of casting lots to discern divine guidance connected directly to this Jewish priestly tradition. The Urim and Thummim ceased to be used after the destruction of the First Temple (586 BCE) - by Second Temple times, their function was lost. The selection of Matthias represents one of the last biblical instances of seeking divine guidance through lots before the Holy Spirit's coming at Pentecost provided direct revelation.",

Though Matthias was not selected through Urim and Thummim specifically (which had been lost centuries earlier), the principle was the same - sacred lots as instruments of divine revelation.",
