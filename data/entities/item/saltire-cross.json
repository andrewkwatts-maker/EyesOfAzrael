  "fullDescription": "The Saltire Cross (Latin: crux decussata, from the Roman numeral X for ten) is the distinctive X-shaped cross associated with Saint Andrew's martyrdom. According to tradition, when Andrew was sentenced to crucifixion in Patras, Greece around 60 CE, he requested to be bound to a different shaped cross than the one on which Christ died, considering himself unworthy of the same form of death as his Lord. For two days he reportedly preached to onlookers from the cross before his death. The diagonal shape became permanently associated with Andrew, appearing in heraldry, vexillology, and Christian iconography worldwide. The white saltire on a blue field forms Scotland's national flag (the oldest continuously used national flag in the world), while a blue saltire on white appears in Russia's naval ensign. The cross symbolizes Christian humility, sacrificial witness, and Andrew's role as the apostle who always brought others to Christ - even from the cross of his own martyrdom.",
