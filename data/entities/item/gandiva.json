  "fullDescription": "Gandiva (Sanskrit: गाण्डीव) is the celestial bow wielded by Arjuna, the greatest archer in the Mahabharata. Created by Brahma himself, this divine weapon was later passed to Arjuna by the god Agni after Arjuna helped him consume the Khandava forest. The Gandiva is described as an incredibly powerful bow that produces a sound like thunder when its string is pulled, striking fear into the hearts of enemies. It possesses the ability to fight against 10,000 ordinary warriors simultaneously and never breaks its string. The bow is indestructible and grants its wielder inexhaustible arrows. Arjuna's mastery of the Gandiva, combined with his skill and divine weapons (astras), made him invincible in battle. After the Kurukshetra war and Krishna's departure, Arjuna returned the Gandiva to the god Varuna.",
