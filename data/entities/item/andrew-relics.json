  "fullDescription": "The relics of Saint Andrew the Apostle have been among the most widely distributed and venerated in Christendom. Following his martyrdom at Patras, Greece (c. 60 CE), Andrew's remains became highly prized. In 357 CE, Emperor Constantius II transferred major portions to Constantinople. According to legend, the monk Saint Rule (Regulus) was divinely instructed to take some relics 'to the ends of the earth' - he landed in Scotland, founding the shrine that became the town of St. Andrews. During the Fourth Crusade (1204), crusaders brought the head of Andrew from Constantinople to Amalfi, Italy. The skull remained in Rome from 1462 until 1964, when Pope Paul VI returned it to Patras as an ecumenical gesture to the Greek Orthodox Church. Other relics are housed in Edinburgh's St. Mary's Cathedral (a shoulder blade returned by the Pope in 1879), the Basilica of Sant'Andrea in Amalfi, various churches in Russia (given Russia's special devotion to Andrew as their apostle), and numerous locations claiming fragments. These distributed relics contributed to Andrew's patronage of multiple nations, each claiming connection through possession of his sacred remains.",
