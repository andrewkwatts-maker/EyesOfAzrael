  "fullDescription": "The oak tree was sacred to Zeus, king of the gods, and symbolized strength, endurance, and divine authority. The mighty oak was considered the most powerful tree in the Greek world, with its deep roots and towering presence reflecting Zeus's dominion over earth and sky.\n\nThe most sacred oak grove stood at Dodona in Epirus, home to Greece's oldest oracle of Zeus. Priestesses interpreted the rustling of the sacred oak leaves as divine messages from the god himself. Pilgrims would travel great distances to hear Zeus speak through the whispers of the ancient oaks.\n\nThe oak's ability to attract lightning made it particularly sacred to Zeus the thunderer. When Zeus hurled his thunderbolts from Olympus, they often struck the tallest oaks, marking these trees as touched by divine power. Such lightning-struck oaks became especially sacred sites for worship and prophecy.",
