  "fullDescription": "The Three-Pronged Scepter of the Sea Lord The Trident of Poseidon stands as one of the most recognizable divine weapons\n                    in Greek mythology, the three-pronged spear that symbolizes the sea god's\n                    dominion over the oceans, earthquakes, and horses. This mighty weapon is\n                    inseparable from Poseidon's identity - in virtually every ancient depiction,\n                    the god holds his trident as both weapon and scepter of his underwater kingdom.",
