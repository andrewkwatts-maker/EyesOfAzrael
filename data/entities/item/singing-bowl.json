  "fullDescription": "Drilbu - Sacred Vessel of Vibrational Healing The Tibetan singing bowl is a type of standing bell used throughout the Himalayan region for\n                    meditation, healing, and religious practice. Unlike conventional bells that hang and swing,\n                    singing bowls rest on a surface or in the palm and produce sound through either striking or\n                    friction. When a wooden or leather-wrapped mallet is rubbed around the rim, the bowl produces\n                    a continuous, rich, harmonic tone that builds in intensity and resonance.",
