  "fullDescription": "The Menorah (Hebrew: מְנוֹרָה, literally 'lamp') is the seven-branched golden candelabrum that stood in the Tabernacle and later in the Temple, providing eternal light before the Holy of Holies. Designed according to God's precise specifications given to Moses on Mount Sinai, the Menorah was fashioned from a single piece of pure gold weighing one talent (approximately 34 kg). Its seven lamps burned pure olive oil and represented the seven days of Creation, divine wisdom, and God's eternal presence with Israel. After the Temple's destruction in 70 CE, the Menorah became the preeminent symbol of Judaism and appears as the emblem of the modern State of Israel.",

In Kabbalah, the seven lamps correspond to the seven lower Sefirot (Chesed through Malkhut), with the central lamp representing Tiferet (beauty/balance). The Menorah as a whole symbolizes Israel as a light unto the nations, bearing divine wisdom to the world.",
      "culturalSignificance": "The Menorah is the oldest and most iconic symbol of Judaism, predating the Star of David by millennia. After the Temple's destruction, it became the primary symbol of Jewish identity and continuity. The Arch of Titus in Rome depicts Roman soldiers carrying the Menorah from Jerusalem, a powerful image of both destruction and survival. Modern synagogues maintain a Ner Tamid (Eternal Light) in memory of the Temple Menorah. The State of Israel chose the Menorah as its official emblem. The nine-branched Hanukkiah used during Hanukkah commemorates the miracle of the oil. In Jewish mysticism, the Menorah represents the emanation of divine light into the world through the Sefirot, making it central to Kabbalistic meditation and practice."
