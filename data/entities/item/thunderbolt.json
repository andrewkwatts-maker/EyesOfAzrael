  "fullDescription": "The Thunderbolt (Greek: κεραυνός keraunos) is Zeus's signature weapon, a bolt of lightning that serves as the ultimate symbol of his sovereignty over sky and cosmos. Forged by the Cyclopes—Brontes, Steropes, and Arges—in gratitude for their liberation from Tartarus, the thunderbolt represents both destructive power and divine justice. Zeus wields it to punish oath-breakers, strike down those who display hubris, enforce cosmic order, and defeat cosmic threats like the Titans and Typhon. Unlike mortal weapons, the thunderbolt never misses and always returns to Zeus's hand. Its very appearance in the sky signifies the direct intervention of divine will.",

      "symbolism": "The thunderbolt symbolizes swift, irresistible divine justice. As lightning descends from heaven to earth, so does Zeus's will move from the divine realm to the mortal. The weapon represents the king's prerogative to punish, the sky's power over earth, and order's victory over chaos. The thunderbolt's forging by the Cyclopes—grateful freed prisoners—also symbolizes that true power flows from gratitude and reciprocal relationships, not tyranny.",
      "culturalSignificance": "The thunderbolt became the ultimate symbol of Zeus's kingship and appears on countless coins, statues, and temple decorations. It influenced the Roman Jupiter's iconography and later Christian depictions of divine power. The phrase 'hurling thunderbolts' entered common language for expressing sudden, powerful judgment. Natural lightning strikes were treated as sacred events, and places struck by lightning were often sanctified or left undisturbed as Zeus's domain."
