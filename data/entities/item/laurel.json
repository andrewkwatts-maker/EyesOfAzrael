  "fullDescription": "The laurel (bay tree) was the most sacred plant of Apollo, god of prophecy, music, and poetry. This evergreen aromatic tree became Apollo's eternal emblem after the tragic transformation of the nymph Daphne, symbolizing artistic achievement, prophetic power, and the bittersweet nature of love.\n\nAfter mocking Eros's archery skills, Apollo was struck by a golden arrow of love, while the river nymph Daphne was struck by a lead arrow of repulsion. Apollo pursued Daphne relentlessly until, desperate to escape, she prayed to her father for help. Just as Apollo reached her, she was transformed into a laurel tree. Heartbroken, Apollo declared the laurel his sacred tree, wearing its leaves as a crown and decreeing that laurel wreaths would honor victors in art, music, and athletic contests.\n\nThe Pythia, Apollo's priestess at Delphi, chewed laurel leaves before delivering prophecies. The laurel was believed to induce prophetic visions and connect mortals with Apollo's divine wisdom. Laurel branches decorated the temple, and supplicants carried laurel boughs when seeking the oracle's guidance.",
