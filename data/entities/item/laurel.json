  "fullDescription": "The laurel or bay tree (Greek: δάφνη daphne) is sacred to Apollo, god of prophecy, music, and the arts. According to myth, the nymph Daphne transformed into a laurel tree to escape Apollo's pursuit, and Apollo declared the tree sacred to him thereafter. Laurel wreaths crowned victors in the Pythian Games at Delphi, poets and artists, and military commanders celebrating triumphs. The Pythia (Oracle of Delphi) chewed laurel leaves to induce prophetic trances, and laurel branches purified sacred spaces. The tree's evergreen nature symbolized immortality and eternal glory, while its aromatic properties connected it to divine inspiration and purification. Apollo's lyre was often made with laurel wood, linking the tree to artistic creativity.",

      "symbolism": "The laurel symbolizes Apollo's domains: prophecy (oracular use), poetry and music (crowning bards), victory (Pythian Games), and purification (cleansing rites). Its evergreen nature represents eternal glory and immortal fame—kleos aphthiton (imperishable glory) sought by Greek heroes. The Daphne myth adds layers of meaning: unrequited love, transformation, the boundary between divine and mortal realms, and how loss can be transmuted into sacred beauty. The aromatic leaves suggest divine inspiration—poets and prophets alike breathe the laurel's essence to access higher knowledge.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Laurel wreaths (corona triumphalis in Latin) became the ultimate symbol of victory and excellence in Greco-Roman culture. 'Laureate' derives from laurel (poet laureate, Nobel laureate). 'Resting on one's laurels' and 'winning one's laurels' entered common speech. The bay leaf remains a culinary staple, connecting ancient sacred use to everyday life. Modern academic regalia and victory ceremonies echo ancient laurel crowning. The laurel symbolizes the immortality conferred by great achievement in arts, athletics, or war."
