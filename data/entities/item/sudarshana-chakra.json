  "fullDescription": "The Sudarshana Chakra (Sanskrit: सुदर्शन चक्र, 'Auspicious Vision Disc') is the divine discus weapon of Lord Vishnu, one of the most powerful weapons in Hindu mythology. This spinning disc possesses 108 serrated edges that can cut through anything, both material and spiritual. The Chakra represents the wheel of time (kala-chakra), the cycle of creation and destruction, and Vishnu's role as the preserver of cosmic order. It is said to be self-powered, eternally spinning, and possessing unlimited energy. When thrown, the Sudarshana Chakra pursues its target with unfailing accuracy, can multiply itself to attack multiple enemies simultaneously, and returns to Vishnu's hand after completing its mission. The weapon is personified as a deity and considered an extension of Vishnu's will.",

The spinning motion symbolizes the restless nature of the mind, which must be controlled and focused like Vishnu controls the Chakra. Its ability to destroy evil represents the power of divine knowledge to cut through ignorance and maya.",
      "culturalSignificance": "The Sudarshana Chakra is one of the most recognizable symbols of Vaishnavism, appearing in temple iconography, religious art, and as a protective symbol. It is worshiped as a deity (Sudarshana Bhagavan) in its own right in some traditions. The Chakra is invoked for protection and is believed to destroy negative energies and evil influences."
