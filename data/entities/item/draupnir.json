  "fullDescription": "Draupnir (Old Norse: 'Dripper' or 'Dropper') is Odin's magical golden arm ring, one of three legendary treasures forged by the dwarven brothers Sindri and Brokkr. Every ninth night, Draupnir produces eight new golden rings of equal weight and beauty, making it a source of infinite wealth. The ring represents the cyclical nature of time and abundance in Norse cosmology, with the number nine being sacred—referencing Odin's nine nights hanging on Yggdrasil. When Baldur died, Odin placed Draupnir on his son's funeral pyre as the most precious offering. After Baldur's death, the ring returned from Helheim with Hermod, demonstrating that even in death, sacred bonds endure. Draupnir symbolizes divine generosity, the self-renewing nature of wisdom and wealth, and the eternal cycles of Norse cosmology.",

      "symbolism": "Draupnir embodies the Norse concept of divine abundance as self-renewing rather than finite. The ring's endless multiplication reflects how wisdom, when shared, multiplies rather than diminishes—each sharing creates more wisdom, like Draupnir creates more rings. The number nine connects it to Odin's sacrifice for runic knowledge, suggesting that true wealth comes from wisdom gained through ordeal. The ring's circular form represents the eternal cycles of Norse cosmology—seasons, generations, cosmic ages. Its return from Helheim shows that sacred relationships transcend death.",
      "culturalSignificance": "In Viking Age Scandinavia, arm rings were the primary symbol of the bond between chieftains and warriors. A lord would 'drip' gold rings to loyal followers, making Draupnir the divine archetype of this practice. The ring demonstrated that a generous lord would never run out of wealth to reward loyalty. Archaeologically, oath rings have been found in Viking Age hoards, showing the cultural importance of ring-giving. Modern Norse pagans use Draupnir as a symbol of abundance consciousness and the principle that generosity creates more wealth."
