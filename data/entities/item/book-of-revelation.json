  "fullDescription": "The Book of Revelation (Greek: Apokalypsis, meaning 'unveiling' or 'disclosure') is the final book of the Christian New Testament, attributed to John of Patmos while exiled on the Aegean island during the reign of Emperor Domitian (c. 95 CE). The text presents itself as both prophecy and letter, beginning with messages to seven churches of Asia Minor before unfolding a vast apocalyptic vision. John is transported to the heavenly throne room where he witnesses the Four Living Creatures worshipping God, the Lamb (Christ) who alone is worthy to open the scroll with seven seals, and a sequence of judgments (seven seals, seven trumpets, seven bowls). The cosmic drama includes warfare between the Woman clothed with the sun and the Dragon (Satan), the rise and fall of the Beast from the Sea and Beast from the Earth, the fall of Babylon the Great, the final battle of Armageddon, the binding of Satan, the last judgment, and culminates in the descent of the New Jerusalem as a bride adorned for her husband. The book has profoundly influenced Christian eschatology, art, literature, and popular culture for two millennia.",

The scroll represents God's purposes in history, openable only by Christ who has conquered through death.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Revelation has shaped Western culture profoundly: the Four Horsemen, Armageddon, 666, Babylon, New Jerusalem, and 'apocalypse' itself have entered common parlance. It inspired countless artistic works from Albrecht Durer to William Blake. Its imagery pervades literature, music, and film. Throughout history, persecuted communities have found hope in its vision of divine justice. It continues to generate intense scholarly debate and popular fascination."
