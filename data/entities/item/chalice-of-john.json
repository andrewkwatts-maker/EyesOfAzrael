  "fullDescription": "The Chalice of Saint John refers to a legendary episode in which Saint John the Evangelist was presented with a poisoned cup by enemies of the faith, but drank from it without harm after making the sign of the cross. The poison is often depicted as a serpent or dragon emerging from the chalice, representing evil fleeing from divine power. This legend became one of the most distinctive iconographic attributes of Saint John, distinguishing him from other apostles in medieval and Renaissance art. The story is found in the apocryphal Acts of John and later hagiographic traditions. According to one version, the high priest of the temple of Diana in Ephesus challenged John to drink from a poisoned cup; John blessed the cup, and the poison emerged as a serpent, after which John drank safely. Another version places this at the court of Emperor Domitian in Rome. The chalice symbolizes John's triumph over spiritual evil, his divine protection, and the superiority of faith over worldly powers. It connects to Jesus' words to James and John: 'Are you able to drink the cup I am about to drink?' (Matthew 20:22), which John fulfilled both symbolically (through this legend) and literally (through his long life of suffering for Christ).",

      "symbolism": "The chalice represents multiple theological themes: Christ's cup of suffering which John pledged to share; the victory of faith over demonic powers (serpent); the transformation of death into life through blessing; and the protection God affords to His faithful servants. The serpent emerging from the cup is a powerful visual of evil expelled by divine power, connecting to Christ's victory over the serpent (Genesis 3:15, Revelation 12).",
      "culturalSignificance": "The chalice became one of the most recognizable attributes of Saint John in Christian art, helping identify him in paintings, sculptures, and stained glass windows. It distinguished him from John the Baptist (depicted with lamb) and other apostles. Churches and guilds dedicated to Saint John often incorporated the chalice-and-serpent motif in their heraldry. The legend reinforced teachings about the protective power of the sign of the cross and blessing."
