  "fullDescription": "The Yew tree (Taxus baccata) holds profound significance in Norse and broader European mythology as a tree of death, rebirth, and eternal life. In Norse tradition, yew wood was used for carving runes and creating magical staves due to its association with the boundary between life and death. The tree's ability to regenerate from its center, appearing to live forever, made it a symbol of immortality and the cyclical nature of existence. Yew is highly toxic, yet from death comes wisdom—the tree embodies the Norse understanding that knowledge often requires sacrifice and danger. Yew wood was prized for making bows, weapons that bring death from a distance, further connecting the tree to both warfare and fate. Some traditions associate yew with Yggdrasil itself or as one of the sacred trees growing near the World Tree.",

      "usage": "Yew wood was considered sacred for carving runes due to its association with death and hidden knowledge. The tree's toxicity parallels the dangerous nature of runic wisdom—powerful but potentially deadly if misused. Yew staves were used for divination and magical workings, especially those concerning fate and the mysteries of death. Warriors valued yew bows for hunting and battle, connecting the tree to both survival and the taking of life. The evergreen nature and extreme longevity of yew symbolized the eternal cycle of death and rebirth central to Norse cosmology.",

      "symbolism": "Yew represents the Norse paradox of death containing life—its poison can kill, yet its evergreen nature symbolizes immortality. The tree's ability to regenerate from its dying center reflects the Norse concept of renewal through destruction. As rune wood, yew connects mortal crafters to the wisdom Odin gained through his death-like ordeal. The flexibility of yew wood that makes excellent bows symbolizes the strength that comes from flexibility rather than rigidity. Ancient yews in graveyards bridge the worlds of the living and dead.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Norse and Viking peoples used yew for creating powerful longbows, making it both sacred and practical. The wood's scarcity in Scandinavia made it a precious import, increasing its mystical value. Rune carvers preferred yew for divination sets because the wood itself carried death-wisdom. Modern Norse pagans use yew for rune crafting and in rituals concerning ancestors, death passages, and deep transformation. The Eihwaz rune (ᛇ) represents yew and symbolizes endurance, protection, and the vertical axis connecting worlds."
