  "fullDescription": "The Trident (Greek: τρίαινα triaina) is the three-pronged spear wielded by Poseidon, god of the sea. Like Zeus's thunderbolt and Hades's helm, it was forged by the Cyclopes as a gift after their liberation from Tartarus. The trident grants Poseidon complete dominion over all waters—he can calm or raise storms, create springs by striking rock, cause earthquakes (earning him the epithet 'Earthshaker'), and command all sea creatures. The three prongs have been interpreted as symbolizing Poseidon's threefold dominion over seas, rivers, and springs, or his power over past, present, and future tides. As a symbol of marine sovereignty, the trident represents both the creative and destructive aspects of water.",

      "symbolism": "The trident represents dominion over the fluid, unpredictable realm of water—both creative (springs, rain, fertility) and destructive (storms, earthquakes, drowning). Its three prongs suggest completeness and cosmic order applied to chaos. As Poseidon rules the sea yet desires land (competing with Athena for Athens), the trident symbolizes ambition and the tension between domains. The weapon's ability to strike water from stone (like Moses's staff) represents hidden abundance and miraculous provision.",
      "culturalSignificance": "The trident became the universal symbol of marine power and appears on Greco-Roman coins, mosaics, and maritime symbols to this day. Naval powers adopted trident imagery to invoke Poseidon's favor. The trident symbol influenced Neptune's iconography in Roman culture and continues to represent oceanic authority in modern contexts, from naval insignia to corporate logos. Coastal cities treated the trident as a sacred protective emblem."
