  "fullDescription": "The Cursed Sword That Must Kill When Drawn Tyrfing is one of the most infamous cursed weapons in Norse and Germanic legend, central to the Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks (The Saga of Hervör and Heidrek). The sword represents the terrible price of forcing dwarves to craft against their will and the inexorable nature of curses spoken in hate and fear. Tyrfing is a weapon of extraordinary power and equally extraordinary doom—its blade never fails, never rusts, cuts through stone and iron as easily as cloth, yet it brings inevitable death to everyone who possesses it.",
