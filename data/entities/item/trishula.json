  "fullDescription": "The Trishula (Sanskrit: त्रिशूल, 'three spear') is Lord Shiva's most iconic weapon, a three-pronged trident that symbolizes his supreme power over the three fundamental aspects of existence. The three prongs represent various trinities: creation-preservation-destruction, past-present-future, the three gunas (sattva-rajas-tamas), and the three states of consciousness (waking-dreaming-deep sleep). The Trishula is said to have the power to destroy the three worlds (physical, astral, and causal) and represents Shiva's complete mastery over time and karma. According to legend, Shiva uses the Trishula to destroy evil, protect dharma, and maintain cosmic balance. The weapon is so powerful that it cannot be stopped once thrown and always returns to Shiva's hand.",

      "symbolism": "The three prongs symbolize Shiva's power over the three fundamental aspects of existence: creation (Brahma), preservation (Vishnu), and destruction (Shiva himself). They also represent the three gunas that bind the soul: sattva (goodness), rajas (passion), and tamas (ignorance). The Trishula's ability to destroy all three demonstrates the path to moksha - transcending material bondage. Additionally, it represents the three nadis (energy channels) in the subtle body: ida, pingala, and sushumna.",
      "culturalSignificance": "The Trishula is one of the most recognizable symbols in Hinduism, appearing in temples, shrines, and iconography throughout India and Southeast Asia. Shaivite ascetics and sadhus carry tridents as symbols of their devotion to Shiva. The symbol is also used in meditation practices to focus on transcending the three gunas and achieving spiritual liberation."
