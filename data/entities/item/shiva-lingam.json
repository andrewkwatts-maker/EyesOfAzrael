Unlike anthropomorphic images of deities, the lingam is an aniconic\n                    symbol—a smooth, cylindrical or elliptical pillar rising from a circular base (yoni),\n                    representing the union of masculine and feminine energies, creation and dissolution,\n                    form and formlessness.",
