  "fullDescription": "The Cup of Divine Grace and Eternal Quest The Holy Grail is perhaps the most enigmatic and sought-after relic in Western mythology and\n                    Christian tradition. At its most basic level, it is believed to be the cup or chalice used by\n                    Jesus Christ at the Last Supper, when he instituted the Eucharist with his disciples. According\n                    to tradition, this same vessel was later used by Joseph of Arimathea to catch Christ's blood\n                    as he hung on the cross.",
