  "fullDescription": "The prayer wheel (Tibetan: mani korlo; Sanskrit: mani chakra) stands as one of Tibetan Buddhism's most distinctive devotional implements—a cylindrical container mounted on a spindle that practitioners rotate while reciting mantras. This ingenious device embodies the Buddhist principle of skillful means, transforming simple physical action into profound spiritual practice. The wheel's rotation, combined with the mantras contained within, multiplies the spiritual merit of prayer countless times with each revolution.",
