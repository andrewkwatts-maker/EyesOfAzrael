  "fullDescription": "The Spear of Thomas is the lance used to martyr the apostle Thomas at Mylapore (modern Chennai), India, around 72 CE. According to the Acts of Thomas and persistent Indian Christian tradition, Thomas was killed by a spear thrust while praying on what is now called St. Thomas Mount (Parangi Malai). The tradition states that the local king Misdaeus (or Mazdai) ordered Thomas's execution after the apostle had converted members of the royal family to Christianity and, in the encratite emphasis of the Acts, persuaded them to practice celibacy. The spear carries profound theological resonance: Thomas, famous for demanding to see and touch Christ's spear wound before believing in the resurrection (John 20:25), ultimately died by the same type of weapon. The instrument of doubt became the instrument of ultimate witness. This poetic justice suggests a completion of Thomas's spiritual journey - from demanding proof of the wounds to receiving his own fatal wound as the final proof of faith. Unlike the Spear of Longinus (Holy Lance), which has multiple claimed relics in European churches, the original Spear of Thomas has not been preserved as a relic. However, the spear has become Thomas's primary iconographic attribute in both Eastern and Western Christian art, where he is typically depicted holding a lance or being pierced by one. The spear symbolizes his martyrdom and, paradoxically, his journey from doubt to unshakeable faith.",
