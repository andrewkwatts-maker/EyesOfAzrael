  "fullDescription": "The Magical Ship That Folds Into a Pocket, Always with Favorable Wind Skíðblaðnir (Old Norse: Skíðblaðnir, meaning \"assembled from thin pieces of wood\" or possibly\n                    \"wooden-bladed\") stands as one of the most remarkable treasures in Norse mythology—a ship that\n                    combined practical perfection with magical convenience in ways that captured the seafaring\n                    imagination of the Vikings. Created by the legendary dwarven craftsmen known as the Sons of\n                    Ivaldi, Skíðblaðnir embodied the ideal vessel: spacious enough to carry all the gods when\n                    needed, fast enough to outrun any pursuer, blessed with eternally favorable winds, yet capable\n                    of folding up small enough to fit in a pocket or pouch when not in use.",
