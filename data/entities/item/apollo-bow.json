  "fullDescription": "The Far-Shooter's Weapon of Light, Plague, and Perfect Aim Apollo's silver bow is one of the most elegant and multifaceted weapons in Greek mythology,\n                    embodying the complex nature of its divine wielder. As the god of light, prophecy, music,\n                    healing, and plague, Apollo uses his bow both to bring swift death and to maintain cosmic\n                    order. The weapon represents the duality inherent in Apollo's nature—he is simultaneously\n                    the most beautiful and civilized of the gods, and one of the most ruthless when his honor\n                    is challenged.",
