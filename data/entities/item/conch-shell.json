  "fullDescription": "The shankha or sacred conch shell is a ritual object of profound importance in Hindu and Buddhist traditions, used as both a musical instrument and a container for sacred water. This large sea shell, typically from the Turbinella pyrum species, produces a deep, resonant sound when blown through an opening at its apex. The shell's natural beauty and acoustic properties combine to create an object of both practical and symbolic significance.",
