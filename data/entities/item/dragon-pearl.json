  "fullDescription": "The Dragon Pearl (龍珠, lóngzhū) is a luminous sphere of concentrated cosmic energy possessed by Chinese dragons. Often depicted as a flaming or glowing orb, the pearl represents the dragon's wisdom, power, and connection to celestial forces. Dragons are frequently shown chasing or holding the pearl, which symbolizes the pursuit of enlightenment, the essence of the universe, or the moon/sun. The pearl grants immense power and is sometimes said to control weather, grant wishes, or contain the dragon's vital essence.",

It appears in paintings, sculptures, embroidery, and architecture. The image influenced Japanese and Korean dragon imagery and became a symbol of Chinese cultural identity."
