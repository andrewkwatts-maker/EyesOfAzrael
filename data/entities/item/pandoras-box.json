  "fullDescription": "The Vessel That Released All Evils Into the World\n\nPandora's Jar (originally pithos, mistranslated as 'box' by Erasmus) is the vessel that contained all evils, which escaped when Pandora lifted its lid, leaving only Hope (Elpis) trapped within. This artifact from Hesiod's Works and Days explains the origin of human suffering as Zeus's punishment for Prometheus's gift of fire.\n\nThe Greek Word: Pithos, Not Pyxis\n\nThe original Greek term is pithos - a large earthenware storage jar used for wine, oil, or grain. These vessels could be large enough to hide a person (as in the story of Eurystheus hiding from Heracles). The mistranslation to 'box' (pyxis) occurred in 1508 when Erasmus translated Hesiod into Latin, using the term pyxis instead of the correct dolium (jar). This error has persisted in popular culture.\n\nContents of the Jar\n\nHesiod describes the jar as containing 'countless plagues' and 'myriad troubles for mankind.' When Pandora opened it:\n\n'Only Hope remained there in an unbreakable home within under the rim of the great jar, and did not fly out at the door; for ere that, the lid of the jar stopped her.'\n\nThe evils that escaped include:\n- Sickness and disease\n- Old age (Geras)\n- Toil and hardship\n- Countless other sorrows\n\nThe Mystery of Hope\n\nWhy Hope (Elpis) alone remained trapped is debated:\n1. Hope remains available to humanity as consolation\n2. Hope is itself an evil (blind hope that prolongs suffering)\n3. Hope's containment means humans cannot foresee their fate\n4. Pandora closed the lid in time to preserve one blessing\n\nThe ambiguity may be intentional - Hesiod's worldview sees life as inescapably difficult, yet humans persist through hope.\n\nSymbolic Significance\n\nThe jar represents:\n- The dangers of divine gifts and curiosity\n- The container of cosmic order (evils were contained before release)\n- The womb (pithos burial jars were used in Greek funerary practice)\n- The ambivalent nature of hope - blessing or curse?\n\nModern Usage\n\n'Opening Pandora's Box' has become an idiom for actions that unleash unforeseen and uncontrollable consequences, usually negative. The phrase appears in literature, politics, and everyday speech to warn against tampering with dangerous situations.",
