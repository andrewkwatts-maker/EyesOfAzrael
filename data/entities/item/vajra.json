  "shortDescription": "Indra's thunderbolt weapon, an indestructible divine weapon symbolizing both destruction and enlightenment",
  "fullDescription": "The Vajra (Sanskrit: वज्र) is the legendary thunderbolt weapon of Indra, king of the Devas and god of thunder and rain. Described as an indestructible, irresistible, and powerful weapon, the Vajra was created by the divine architect Tvastar from the bones of the sage Dadhichi, who sacrificed himself to provide material for a weapon capable of defeating the asura Vritra. The Vajra has two forms: the hard diamond (representing indestructibility) and the lightning bolt (representing irresistible force). In Buddhist tradition, it evolved into the vajra ritual object symbolizing the diamond-hard nature of enlightenment and the thunderbolt of wisdom that cuts through ignorance.",
