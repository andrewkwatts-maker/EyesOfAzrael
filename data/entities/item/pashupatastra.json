  "fullDescription": "The Supreme Weapon of Shiva - Destroyer of All Creation The Pashupatastra (Sanskrit: \"Weapon of Pashupati\") is considered the most devastating weapon\n                    in Hindu mythology, surpassing even the Brahmastra in destructive potential. As the personal\n                    weapon of Lord Shiva in his aspect as Pashupati (\"Lord of Animals\" or \"Lord of All Beings\"),\n                    this astra embodies the god's role as the destroyer in the Hindu trinity. When unleashed, it\n                    can annihilate anything in creation - gods, demons, humans, or the universe itself.",
