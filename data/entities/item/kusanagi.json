  "fullDescription": "Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi (草薙の剣, 'Grass-Cutting Sword'), also known as Ame-no-Murakumo-no-Tsurugi ('Sword of the Gathering Clouds of Heaven'), is one of the Three Imperial Regalia of Japan (Sanshu no Jingi). According to the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, the storm god Susanoo discovered the sword in the tail of the eight-headed serpent Yamata-no-Orochi after slaying it. The sword was originally called Ame-no-Murakumo because it was found amid the clouds above the serpent. Susanoo presented it to his sister Amaterasu as a reconciliation gift. Later, Amaterasu gave it to her grandson Ninigi when he descended to rule the earthly realm. The sword gained its name Kusanagi ('Grass-Cutter') when the legendary hero Yamato Takeru used it to cut down burning grass during a battle, saving his life. The sword represents valor and is said to reside at Atsuta Shrine in Nagoya, though its exact location and condition remain one of Japan's greatest mysteries.",

As one of the Three Sacred Treasures, it forms part of the cosmic trinity: mirror (wisdom), jewel (benevolence), and sword (valor).",
      "culturalSignificance": "Kusanagi remains central to Japanese imperial tradition and national identity. The sword has never been publicly displayed, adding to its mystique. Its location at Atsuta Shrine makes the shrine one of Japan's most important Shinto sites. The sword's legend influenced countless samurai who saw it as the ideal of martial virtue. During World War II, concerns about the sword's safety during American bombing led to special protection measures. The sword's mystery continues to inspire literature, anime, manga, and video games."
