  "fullDescription": "The Image of Edessa, known in Greek as the Mandylion (from Arabic mandil, 'towel' or 'cloth'), was one of the most celebrated Christian relics of the medieval world. According to legend, when King Abgar V of Edessa sent a letter to Jesus requesting healing, Jesus replied with a promise to send a disciple. Some versions of the tradition add that Jesus pressed a cloth to his face, miraculously imprinting his image upon it, and sent this image with his letter. Other versions attribute the image's origin to Thaddaeus, who brought it to Edessa, or to the cloth used by a woman (later identified with Veronica) to wipe Jesus's face on the way to Calvary. The image was described as showing Christ's face alone, with eyes open, unlike the Shroud of Turin. The Mandylion was the archetypal 'acheiropoieton' (image not made by hands), believed to be of supernatural origin. According to Evagrius Scholasticus, the image miraculously saved Edessa from Persian siege in 544 CE. In 944 CE, Byzantine Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos obtained the image and brought it to Constantinople in a grand ceremony on August 15. It remained in Constantinople until the Fourth Crusade (1204), after which its fate is disputed - some claim it was taken to Paris and destroyed in the French Revolution, others identify it with the Shroud of Turin, and still others believe it survives in various claimed locations.",

    "iconographic_influence": "The frontal, solemn depiction of Christ's face on the Mandylion became the model for Byzantine Pantocrator images and influenced Orthodox iconography for centuries. The 'Holy Face' tradition in both East and West traces back to this image."
