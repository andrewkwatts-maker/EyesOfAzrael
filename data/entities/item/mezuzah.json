  "fullDescription": "The mezuzah is a small parchment scroll inscribed with Torah verses, rolled and placed inside a protective case, then affixed to the doorposts of Jewish homes. The word \"mezuzah\" literally means \"doorpost\" in Hebrew, though common usage has transferred the term to the scroll and case mounted upon it. This practice transforms every doorway into a point of encounter with divine commandment.",
