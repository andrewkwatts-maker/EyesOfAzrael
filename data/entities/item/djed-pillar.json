  "fullDescription": "The Djed pillar (ḏd) is one of ancient Egypt's most profound symbols, representing stability, permanence, and resurrection. This pillar consists of a vertical shaft with four horizontal bars near the top, resembling a column or stylized tree trunk. Most importantly, it symbolizes the backbone of Osiris, the god of the afterlife, embodying his triumph over death and his eternal stability. The Djed was central to the 'Raising of the Djed' ceremony during the coronation and festivals, symbolizing the resurrection of Osiris and the renewal of pharaonic power. As an amulet, the Djed was placed on mummies to ensure stability in the afterlife. Together with the ankh (life) and Was scepter (power), it forms the sacred triad of Egyptian divine symbols.",

During the annual 'Raising of the Djed' ceremony, the pharaoh and priests would physically raise a djed pillar, symbolizing Osiris's resurrection and the renewal of life. This ritual affirmed the pharaoh's role as Horus, Osiris's son and heir. Djed amulets were placed on mummies, particularly at the base of the spine, to ensure the deceased would have stability and endurance in the afterlife. The symbol appeared extensively in temple architecture, tomb decorations, and funerary texts.",

      "symbolism": "The Djed embodies the Egyptian concept of enduring stability through resurrection. As Osiris's backbone, it represents his ability to rise from death and maintain cosmic order. The four horizontal bars may represent the four cardinal directions, the four pillars holding up the sky, or the vertebrae of the spine. The Djed teaches that true stability comes not from avoiding death but from transcending it - Osiris was murdered and dismembered but achieved eternal life. This made the Djed the ultimate symbol of the Egyptian belief in resurrection and the continuity of life through death.",
      "culturalSignificance": "The Raising of the Djed ceremony was one of ancient Egypt's most important festivals, celebrated at Memphis and throughout the kingdom. It connected pharaonic authority directly to Osirian resurrection mythology, legitimizing the king's rule through divine succession. The Djed influenced architectural design, with temple columns often incorporating djed symbolism. The symbol remains powerful in modern Egyptian culture and neo-pagan practices as an emblem of enduring strength and spiritual resurrection."
