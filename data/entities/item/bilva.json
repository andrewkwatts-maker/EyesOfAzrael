  "fullDescription": "The Bilva (Sanskrit: बिल्व, Aegle marmelos), also known as Bael or Wood Apple tree, is one of the most sacred trees in Hinduism, particularly revered in Shaivism. The tree's distinctive three-leafed (trifoliate) structure makes it especially sacred to Lord Shiva, representing the three aspects of time (past, present, future), the three gunas (sattva, rajas, tamas), and Shiva's trident (Trishula). According to mythology, the Bilva tree arose from the sweat drops of goddess Parvati and is considered extremely dear to Shiva. The leaves are an essential offering in Shiva worship, and it is said that offering Bilva leaves to Shiva absolves sins and brings moksha. The tree and its leaves are believed to be an abode of Lakshmi and have powerful medicinal properties in Ayurveda.",

The trifoliate structure mirrors Shiva's trident (Trishula), making it a natural symbol of Shiva's power. The leaf's ability to remain fresh for a long time symbolizes the eternal nature of Shiva. Offering Bilva to Shiva represents offering one's three sources of debt (to gods, sages, and ancestors) and the three types of suffering (physical, mental, spiritual). The bitter-sweet taste of Bilva fruit represents the duality of existence that Shiva transcends.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Bilva trees are planted near Shiva temples and in homes of Shiva devotees. The leaves must be handled with reverence and never touched with the feet. It is considered highly auspicious to have a Bilva tree in one's compound. The tree's wood is sometimes used for sacred fire rituals. In Ayurveda, Bilva fruit is highly valued for treating digestive disorders, and the leaves, roots, and bark all have medicinal applications. The tree thus represents the integration of spiritual devotion and physical well-being."
