  "fullDescription": "Myrtle was the sacred plant of Aphrodite, goddess of love and beauty. This fragrant evergreen shrub with its delicate white flowers and aromatic leaves embodied love, beauty, desire, and the mysteries of passion. The connection between myrtle and Aphrodite runs deep through Greek mythology and ritual practice.\n\nWhen Aphrodite emerged from the sea foam near Cyprus, she first took shelter behind a myrtle bush to preserve her modesty from the eyes of watching gods. From that moment, myrtle became her sacred plant, forever associated with her beauty and the sweet mysteries of love. The island of Cyprus, Aphrodite's sacred land, was renowned for its fragrant myrtle groves.\n\nMyrtle's evergreen nature and delicate beauty made it the perfect emblem of enduring love. Aphrodite was often depicted crowned with myrtle, and her temples were planted with myrtle groves. The plant's associations with fertility, beauty, and passion made it central to Greek wedding ceremonies and love rituals.",
