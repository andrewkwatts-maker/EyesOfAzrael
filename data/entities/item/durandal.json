This weapon represents the pinnacle of Carolingian legendary armament,\n                    a blade so perfectly crafted and blessed that no force on earth could break it. More than\n                    a mere weapon, Durandal was a sacred vessel containing Christian relics, transforming it\n                    into a portable shrine as much as a sword.",
