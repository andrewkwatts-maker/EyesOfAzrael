  "fullDescription": "The Golden Fleece (Greek: χρυσόμαλλον δέρας) is the fleece of the divine ram Chrysomallos, sent by Zeus to rescue Phrixus and Helle from their murderous stepmother. After Phrixus sacrificed the ram to Zeus in gratitude, he hung the fleece in the sacred grove of Ares in Colchis, where it was guarded by a sleepless dragon. The fleece possessed magical properties, bringing prosperity and legitimacy to whoever possessed it. Jason's quest to retrieve the fleece became one of Greek mythology's greatest adventures, involving the Argonauts' perilous journey and his alliance with the sorceress Medea. The fleece symbolizes the ultimate prize, legitimate kingship, and divine favor.",

      "symbolism": "The Golden Fleece represents the ultimate goal of the hero's journey—legitimacy, restoration of rightful order, and divine blessing. Its golden color symbolizes incorruptibility, solar kingship, and divine radiance. The fleece's journey from salvation (rescuing Phrixus) to sacrifice to treasure to quest object mirrors transformation through trials. The dragon guardian represents the trials that protect true sovereignty from unworthy claimants. Jason's need for Medea's help suggests that legitimate power requires both courage and wisdom (or masculine and feminine principles united).",
      "culturalSignificance": "The Golden Fleece became the archetypal quest object in Western literature, inspiring countless adventure narratives. The Order of the Golden Fleece, founded in 1430, remains one of Europe's most prestigious chivalric orders. The fleece symbolizes the legitimate transfer of power and divine mandate. The Argonauts' quest united heroes from across Greece, making the fleece a symbol of pan-Hellenic cooperation and cultural unity."
