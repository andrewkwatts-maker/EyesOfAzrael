  "fullDescription": "Yasakani no Magatama (八尺瓊勾玉, 'Eight-Shaku Curved Jewel') is the sacred jewel and one of the Three Imperial Regalia of Japan. Magatama are comma-shaped or curved beads that have been found in Japan dating back to prehistoric times, often made of jade, agate, or quartz. The Yasakani no Magatama was created by the deity Tamanooya-no-Mikoto to help lure Amaterasu from the Heavenly Rock Cave. Along with the mirror, it was hung on the sacred sakaki tree outside the cave. The jewel represents benevolence and compassion, the third Imperial virtue alongside wisdom (mirror) and valor (sword). It was given to Ninigi when he descended from Takamagahara and has been passed down through the Imperial line. The jewel is currently kept in the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, in the Sword and Jewel Sanctuaries. Like the other regalia, it has never been publicly displayed, and its exact appearance, size, and material composition remain uncertain.",

      "symbolism": "The magatama represents benevolence (仁 jin) and compassion, essential virtues for righteous rule. The curved shape has multiple symbolic interpretations: the soul's journey, the unity of opposites (yin-yang), fertility, or the moon. Some scholars suggest it represents a bear's fang or a fetal position, symbolizing life and protection. The jewel's material (possibly jade) connects to earth and longevity. The color green traditionally represents life, growth, and harmony with nature. As a necklace of multiple beads, it may represent the unity of many people under one ruler.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Magatama jewels are iconic symbols of ancient Japan, found in archaeological sites across the archipelago. They were worn by rulers and buried with the elite, suggesting their connection to power and the afterlife. The Yasakani no Magatama's presence in the Imperial Palace makes it more accessible than the mirror (at Ise) but still hidden from public view. The jewel's mystery has led to various theories about its composition and appearance. Some sources suggest it might be a string of many magatama rather than a single jewel. The jewel inspires modern jewelry and appears frequently in Japanese art and popular culture."
