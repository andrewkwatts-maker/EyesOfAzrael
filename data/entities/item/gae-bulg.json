  "fullDescription": "The Gae Bulg (Irish: spear of mortal pain/death) is the legendary weapon of the Irish hero Cu Chulainn. Crafted from the bones of a sea monster and given to Cu Chulainn by his martial arts teacher Scathach, this fearsome spear was thrown with the foot and created thirty barbs upon penetrating the victim's body, making it impossible to remove without killing the victim. It could only be removed by cutting away the flesh around it.",
