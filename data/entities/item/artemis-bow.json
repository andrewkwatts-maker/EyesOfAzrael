  "fullDescription": "The Huntress's Weapon of the Wild Moon Artemis's golden bow is the twin weapon to Apollo's silver bow, forged to complement her brother's\n                    armament while serving distinctly different purposes. While Apollo's bow deals with plague, prophecy,\n                    and divine judgment, Artemis's bow is the weapon of the hunt, the protector of wilderness, and the\n                    guardian of young maidens. It represents the untamed power of nature, the fierce independence of the\n                    virgin goddess, and the swift, merciful death granted to women in childbirth.",
