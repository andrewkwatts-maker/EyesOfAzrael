  "shortDescription": "The blood money paid to Judas Iscariot for betraying Jesus, fulfilling Zechariah's prophecy and becoming the archetypal symbol of betrayal's price",
  "fullDescription": "The thirty pieces of silver represent one of the most symbolically charged objects in Christian tradition - the price paid by the chief priests to Judas Iscariot for betraying Jesus Christ. This sum, referenced in Zechariah 11:12-13 centuries earlier, connected the betrayal to prophetic fulfillment. In Jewish law, thirty shekels was the compensation for a slave killed by an ox (Exodus 21:32), suggesting the payment valued Jesus at a slave's worth. After Jesus's condemnation, Judas was seized with remorse and attempted to return the money, declaring 'I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood.' When the priests refused to accept it back, Judas threw the coins into the temple and went out to hang himself. The priests, recognizing they could not put 'blood money' (the price of blood) into the temple treasury, used it to purchase a potter's field for burying strangers - thereafter called Akeldama, the 'Field of Blood.' Matthew explicitly connects this to Zechariah's prophecy: 'they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued... and gave them for the potter's field.' The thirty pieces have become the universal symbol of betrayal's wages, ill-gotten gain, and the terrible cost of valuing money over loyalty and love. The phrase 'thirty pieces of silver' remains a common idiom for the price of betrayal.",
