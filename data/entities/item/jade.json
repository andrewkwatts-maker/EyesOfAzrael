  "fullDescription": "Jade (玉, yù) is the most sacred stone in Chinese mythology and culture, believed to embody the five virtues: charity, modesty, courage, justice, and wisdom. More precious than gold in ancient China, jade is associated with immortality, spiritual purity, and divine power. The stone comes in two main types: nephrite (软玉) and jadeite (硬玉), with nephrite being the traditional Chinese jade. Jade is used in ritual objects, imperial seals, burial suits, and talismans, serving as a bridge between the earthly and celestial realms.",
