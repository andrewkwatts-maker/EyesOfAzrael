  "fullDescription": "The Budding Staff That Confirmed Divine Election Aaron's Rod is one of the most remarkable relics in biblical tradition, a dead wooden staff that\n                    miraculously sprouted, bloomed, and bore fruit overnight as a divine sign confirming Aaron's\n                    selection as High Priest of Israel. This miracle silenced those who challenged the authority\n                    of Moses and Aaron, establishing the Levitical priesthood with irrefutable divine attestation.",
