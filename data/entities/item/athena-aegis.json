  "fullDescription": "The Divine Shield Bearing the Gorgon's Terrifying Visage The Aegis (Greek: Αἰγίς, \"goatskin\") stands as one of the most enigmatic and terrifying protective\n                    devices in all of classical mythology. Most commonly associated with Athena, the goddess of wisdom\n                    and strategic warfare, the aegis represents divine protection so absolute that merely displaying it\n                    could turn entire armies to flight. The very word \"aegis\" has entered modern language to mean\n                    \"protection\" or \"sponsorship,\" yet few realize the fearsome nature of the original artifact.",
