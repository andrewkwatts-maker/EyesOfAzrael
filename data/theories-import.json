The analysis explores connections between the 10 Sefirot and 10-dimensional M-theory, the 72 Names of God and Euler characteristic χ=72 in Calabi-Yau manifolds, and the 4 Worlds as dimensional hierarchies. The theory presents these as hypotheses for investigation, with explicit confidence ratings and intellectual honesty warnings about apophenia risks.",

The 7 planetary heavens (Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn) correspond to 7 shadow/hidden branes, while Earth is the 1 observable brane. Ziggurat architecture with 7 levels may represent physical models. Base-60 mathematics potentially encodes dimensional ratios. The theory acknowledges this likely reflects observational astronomy (7 visible wandering stars) rather than encoded physics.",
