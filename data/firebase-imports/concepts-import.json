      "longDescription": "Sovereignty in Celtic tradition is both a goddess and a principle representing the sacred marriage between king and land. The rightful king is chosen by the sovereignty goddess and must prove worthy. The king's fitness directly affects the land's fertility and prosperity. Breaking this sacred bond brings disaster. Sovereignty goddesses often appear as beautiful women or hags, transforming when the true king is found.",
