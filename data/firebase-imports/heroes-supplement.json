There, God revealed His personal name—\nYHWH (the Tetragrammaton)—and commissioned Moses to return to Egypt and demand Pharaoh release the Israelites. Despite his\nprotests about inadequacy and his speech impediment, God appointed him as deliverer, with his brother Aaron as spokesman.",

The Israelites marked their doorposts with lamb's\nblood (the origin of Passover), sparing them from the final plague. After this, Pharaoh released them, but then pursued\nwith his army.

At Kadesh, when the people demanded\nwater, Moses struck the rock in anger rather than speaking to it as commanded, failing to sanctify God before the people.\nFor this, God decreed that Moses would see but not enter the Promised Land.",

Every Jewish prayer service, every Sabbath, every holiday references Moses' teachings. The\nrevelation at Sinai is the defining moment of Jewish identity, when Israel became God's covenant people through the\nmediation of Moses. His humility (described as the most humble man on earth), his intimacy with God (speaking \"face to\nface\"), and his absolute dedication to his people make him the model of Jewish leadership and faith.",
