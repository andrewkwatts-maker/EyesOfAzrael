As K'uk'ulkan among the Yucatec Maya\n                and Q'uq'umatz among the K'iche', this winged serpent god brought knowledge, civilization, and the\n                sacred calendar to humanity. His descent as a serpent of light at Chichen Itza each equinox remains\n                one of the world's most spectacular archaeoastronomical phenomena.",
