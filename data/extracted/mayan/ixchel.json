    "description": "The great Moon Goddess of the Maya, Ixchel embodies the creative and destructive powers of feminine\n                divinity. As goddess of the moon, childbirth, medicine, and weaving, she presides over the cycles\n                of life, fertility, and death. Appearing both as a beautiful young woman and as a fearsome crone,\n                she represents the transformative power of the feminine across all stages of life. Her sacred shrine\n                on the island of Cozumel drew pilgrims from across the Maya world for centuries.",
