This period is marked by the appearance of luminous visions:\n                    \n\nDays 1-7: Peaceful Deities: The consciousness encounters visions of the\n                            Five Buddha Families and 42 peaceful deities emanating brilliant colored lights. These are\n                            projections of its own enlightened nature. Simultaneously, softer colored lights appear\n                            leading to the six realms—these are attractive but lead to rebirth. The consciousness must\n                            recognize the brilliant lights as its own nature and merge with them for liberation.\nDays 8-14: Wrathful Deities: When the consciousness fails to recognize\n                            the peaceful deities, more intense visions appear—58 wrathful deities with fierce forms,\n                            adorned with skulls, drinking blood, surrounded by flames.

Key experiences include:\n                    \n\nJudgment: The consciousness meets Yama, the Lord of Death, who holds up\n                            a mirror showing all the being's actions. White and black stones representing virtuous and\n                            negative actions are counted. This is not judgment by an external judge but the objective\n                            manifestation of karma.

            "Judgment: The consciousness meets Yama, the Lord of Death, who holds up\n                            a mirror showing all the being's actions. White and black stones representing virtuous and\n                            negative actions are counted. This is not judgment by an external judge but the objective\n                            manifestation of karma. The consciousness itself knows the truth of its actions.\nWandering: Unable to find peace, the bardo being wanders, experiencing\n                            hunger, thirst, and exposure. It tries to communicate with the living but cannot. It seeks\n                            its old body and mourns when realizing it's dead. Karmic winds blow it toward its destined\n                            rebirth realm.\nSigns of Rebirth Realm: The environment takes on characteristics of the\n                            destination realm. Those heading to hell realms experience increasing cold or heat, frightening\n                            sounds, and oppressive darkness. Those heading to god realms experience beautiful music,\n                            pleasant aromas, and celestial visions.\nSeeking Embodiment: After up to 49 days, the consciousness is irresistibly\n                            drawn to take rebirth. It sees couples copulating and, driven by attraction to one parent\n                            and aversion to the other, its consciousness enters the womb at conception. In other realms,\n                            it may be spontaneously reborn, appear in an egg, or take form according to that realm's\n                            nature."
