    "intro": "Izanagi's myths are the foundational narratives of Shinto cosmology. His story is one of cosmic creation followed by devastating personal loss, ultimately transformed through ritual purification into new creation. These myths establish core Shinto concepts: the sacredness of land, the power of purification, and the separation between the living and the dead.",

To consummate their divine marriage, they walked around the pillar in opposite directions - Izanami from the right, Izanagi from the left. When they met, Izanami spoke first in greeting. Their first child, Hiruko (the leech-child), was born deformed and was placed in a reed boat and set adrift - punishment for Izanami having spoken first, violating proper order."

Izanami replied from the shadows: she had already eaten the food of Yomi and could not easily return. She would petition the gods of the underworld but commanded Izanagi not to look upon her."

He saw her corpse crawling with maggots, her body rotting, eight thunder kami born from her decay. The polluted Izanami, shamed and enraged, sent the Shikome (Hags of Yomi) and the thunder gods to pursue him."

        "description": "Izanagi fled, throwing obstacles behind him. His headdress became grapes; his comb teeth became bamboo shoots - diversions for his pursuers. At the slope of Yomi (Yomotsu Hirasaka), he found three peaches and threw them at the army of the dead, driving them back. Finally, Izanami herself pursued him. At the boundary between worlds, Izanagi rolled a massive boulder across the entrance, sealing Yomi forever."

Izanagi replied he would then ensure one thousand five hundred were born each day. Thus death entered the world, but life would always exceed it. Their marriage was dissolved - the first divorce."

    "festivals & practices": "<li><strong>Oharae (Great Purification):</strong> June 30 and December 31 purification rituals that trace directly to Izanagi's misogi, cleansing pollution accumulated over the half-year</li>\n<li><strong>Misogi-harae:</strong> Water purification rituals practiced at rivers and seas, following Izanagi's example</li>\n<li><strong>Taga Taisha Matsuri:</strong> Major festival at Taga Shrine celebrating Izanagi</li>",
    "worship practices": "Izanagi is primarily invoked in the context of purification, creation, and new beginnings. His example established misogi (water purification) as the fundamental Shinto practice for removing pollution and restoring spiritual cleanliness. Couples may pray to Izanagi (and Izanami together) for fertility, creative endeavors, and harmonious marriage - though the awareness of their ultimate separation adds complexity to such prayers. His mythology also makes him significant for those dealing with grief and loss, as he was the first to experience the death of a loved one."
