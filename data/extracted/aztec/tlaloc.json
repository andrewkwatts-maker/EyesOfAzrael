    "description": "Among the oldest and most revered deities of Mesoamerica, Tlaloc was the god of rain, fertility, and water.\n                Predating the Aztecs by millennia, his goggle-eyed visage appears in the ruins of Teotihuacan. He brought\n                the life-giving rains that made agriculture possible, but also the devastating floods, hail, and lightning\n                that could destroy crops and lives. His paradise, Tlalocan, awaited those who died by water or lightning.",

During this age, the world was\n                    destroyed by a rain of fire - some say volcanic eruptions, others a rain of burning stones from\n                    the sky.
