She is creation and destruction inseparable.",

A ball of hummingbird feathers fell from the sky, and she placed them in her\n                    bosom. When she discovered she was pregnant, her four hundred sons (the <span class=\"nahuatl-term\">Centzon Huitznahua</span>,\n                    representing the stars of the southern sky) and her daughter <span class=\"nahuatl-term\">Coyolxauhqui</span>\n                    (the moon) were outraged."
