He succeeded in stealing them from the death god\n                    Mictlantecuhtli, though he fell into a pit and shattered the bones into pieces of varying sizes (explaining\n                    why humans come in different heights). He brought the bone fragments to the paradise of Tamoanchan, where the\n                    goddess Cihuacoatl ground them into powder. The gods then mixed the powder with their own blood, creating the\n                    humans of the Fifth Sun."
