Some traditions suggest she may have been a goddess or giantess associated with trees or islands. Her son <a class=\"corpus-link\" data-term=\"Loki\" data-tradition=\"norse\" href=\"../corpus-search.html?tradition=norse&amp;term=loki\" title=\"Search corpus for 'Loki'\">Loki</a> inherited his shapeshifting abilities and cunning nature, though whether these came from his mother or father remains unclear in the myths."
