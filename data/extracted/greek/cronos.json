    "ancient cult": "Unlike the Olympian gods, Cronos received limited direct worship in classical Greece. However, his festival, the Kronia, was celebrated in Athens and other cities during harvest time. The festival involved role reversals where masters served slaves, echoing the freedom and equality of the Golden Age. This tradition influenced the Roman Saturnalia, one of ancient Rome's most popular festivals.",
    "philosophical interpretations": "Greek philosophers interpreted Cronos allegorically. Stoics saw him as representing rational order and the cycles of nature. Platonists associated him with nous (divine intellect) and the eternal realm beyond time. The name \"Kronos\" was often confused with \"Chronos\" (personified time), reinforcing his association with temporal flow and the measurement of ages.",
    "artistic depictions": "In ancient art, Cronos appears as a mature, bearded figure holding a sickle or harpē. Renaissance and later artists, influenced by Roman sources identifying him with Saturn, depicted him as \"Father Time\" with an hourglass or scythe. Francisco Goya's famous painting \"Saturn Devouring His Son\" (1819-1823) captures the horror of the infanticide myth, representing time's destructive power and parental anxiety."
