  "description": "A monstrous water serpent with multiple heads and deadly venom, the Lernaean Hydra was one of the most fearsome creatures of Greek mythology. Dwelling in the swamps of Lake Lerna, this immortal horror possessed the terrifying ability to regenerate - for every head severed, two more would sprout in its place. Only through the combined efforts of Heracles and his nephew Iolaus was this seemingly invincible beast finally defeated.",
