    "description": "The mighty Orisha of thunder and lightning, Shango embodies royal power, virility, and divine justice. Once a mortal king of the Oyo Empire, he became deified after death. His thunderstones (edun ara) fall from the sky when lightning strikes, and his double-headed axe (oshe) channels the power of storms. Shango is passion, power, and righteous fury made manifest - the king who speaks with the voice of the thunder.",

    "sacred objects": "<strong>Thunderstones (Edun Ara):</strong> Prehistoric stone axes and celts found in the ground after lightning strikes are believed to be Shango's thunderbolts. These are kept on his shrine and are central to his worship. The sound of thunder is Shango's voice; the lightning is his weapon striking the earth. <strong>Oshe Shango:</strong> The double-headed axe is Shango's primary symbol. It represents his ability to deliver justice from any direction and the duality of his power - creative and destructive. Priests carry elaborately carved oshe during ceremonies.",
    "sacred music - bata drums": "Shango is intimately connected with the bata drums - a set of three double-headed drums that \"speak\" the Yoruba language. The bata drums were first played for Shango during his reign in Oyo and remain essential to his worship. The drums call the Orisha and induce possession in devotees. Each Orisha has specific rhythms; Shango's rhythms are particularly powerful and complex.",
    "festivals": "The annual <strong>Shango Festival</strong> in Oyo State, Nigeria, is one of the most spectacular Yoruba festivals. For several days, devotees dance, drum, and make offerings. Priests carrying the oshe demonstrate possession by Shango, sometimes handling fire without being burned. The festival commemorates the king who became a god."
