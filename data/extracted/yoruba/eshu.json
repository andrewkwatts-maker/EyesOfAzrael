    "description": "The most complex and misunderstood of all Orisha, Eshu stands at the crossroads between the human and divine worlds. He is the messenger who carries sacrifices to Olodumare and brings divine responses to humanity. Master of language, chance, and transformation, Eshu opens and closes roads, creates chaos and opportunity, and reminds humans that the universe is fundamentally unpredictable. Without Eshu, no communication between worlds is possible - which is why every ritual begins with his acknowledgment.",

    "sacred locations": "Unlike most Orisha who have specific natural features (rivers, mountains), Eshu's shrines are found at transitional spaces: <li><strong>Crossroads:</strong> Where paths meet - his primary domain</li>\n<li><strong>Doorways/Thresholds:</strong> The space between inside and outside</li>\n<li><strong>Market entrances:</strong> Where commerce and exchange occur</li>\n<li><strong>Behind the door:</strong> In homes, an Eshu shrine often sits behind the front door</li>\n<li><strong>At the edge of the compound:</strong> Guarding the boundary</li>",
    "ritual protocol": "<strong>Always honor Eshu first.</strong> Before any ceremony, divination, or offering to another Orisha, Eshu receives his portion. This ensures he will carry your message to the intended Orisha rather than disrupting the communication. Neglecting Eshu is the quickest way to ensure ritual failure."
