She embodies the deep, mysterious, life-giving power of the waters. Yemoja fiercely protects women, especially pregnant women and mothers, and all who dwell near the sea. Her embrace is like the ocean - vast, nurturing, and capable of tremendous power when her children are threatened.",

In the diaspora, the ocean itself is her shrine - devotees make offerings at the beach, especially at sunset or during the full moon.",
    "festivals": "The <strong>Yemoja Festival</strong> in Abeokuta, Nigeria, is a major annual celebration featuring processions to the river, offerings of food and flowers, and prayers for fertility and protection.
