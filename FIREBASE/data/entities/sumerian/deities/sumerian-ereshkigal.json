  "longDescription": "Queen of the Great Below, Lady of Kur\n\nEreshkigal is the absolute sovereign of Kur, the Land of No Return. She is the dark sister of Inanna, ruling the realm of the dead with impartial harshness. In her domain, all humans—king and slave, hero and coward—face the same dusty fate. Even gods who enter Kur fall under her power. She embodies the inevitability of death and the finality of mortality. Her name means \"Great Lady of the Great Below.\"\n\nEreshkigal represents the absolute power of death. She is feared, not loved. Her realm accepts all who die, offering no paradise for the virtuous or punishment for the wicked—only gray, dusty existence. Her myths demonstrate that even divine power cannot escape mortality in her domain.\n\nEreshkigal rules Kur, the underworld realm described as the \"Land of No Return\" or \"Land from which none who enter emerge.\" It is a dark city beneath the earth, surrounded by seven walls and seven gates.\n\nEreshkigal appears in ancient Sumerian cuneiform texts. Search the ORACC corpus to explore original texts in transliteration and translation.\n\nMajor texts include: \"Inanna's Descent,\" \"Nergal and Ereshkigal,\" underworld texts\n\nEreshkigal had no major temples for joyful worship—she was feared, not celebrated. However, shrines existed at gravesites and in connection with funerary rituals. Her power was acknowledged in death rites and offerings to the dead. Cemeteries and tombs were considered her domain on earth.\n\nPrayers to Ereshkigal were pragmatic—requests for delayed death, proper treatment of deceased loved ones, and protection from demons. \"Ereshkigal, great queen of Kur, let this soul find rest in your dark city. Accept these offerings and grant mercy to one who walks in your realm.\" Exorcists invoked her name to command demons. Mourners prayed for the dead to be received well in her kingdom.",
