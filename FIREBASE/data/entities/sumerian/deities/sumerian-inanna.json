She is bold, ambitious, and unstoppable. Inanna's myths show her stealing divine powers from Enki, conquering the underworld, and demanding worship from cities. She embodies the paradox of creation and destruction, love and war, life and death.\n\nInanna's myths are among the most powerful and psychologically complex in ancient literature. She is never passive—she acts, demands, conquers, and transforms. Her stories explore desire, power, mortality, and rebirth.\n\nInanna appears extensively in ancient Sumerian cuneiform texts. Search the ORACC corpus to explore original texts mentioning Inanna in transliteration and translation.\n\nAlso known as: Inana (alternate spelling). Major texts include: \"Inanna and Enki,\" \"The Descent of Inanna,\" \"Inanna and the Huluppu Tree,\" hymns to Inanna from Uruk\n\nUruk was Inanna's primary cult center, where she shared the great temple E-anna (\"House of Heaven\") with An. Uruk was ancient Mesopotamia's largest and most powerful city. Inanna was also worshipped at Zabalam, Akkad, and eventually throughout the ancient Near East as Ishtar (Akkadian/Babylonian), Astarte (Canaanite), and Aphrodite (Greek).\n\nPrecious jewelry and clothing, perfumes and oils, date wine and honey cakes, red dyed textiles, lions (sacrificed or depicted), flowers (especially roses), gold and lapis lazuli. Sacred prostitutes (hierodules) served in her temples, and sexual acts were considered worship. Musicians and dancers performed in her honor, as art and beauty glorified the goddess.\n\nLovers prayed to Inanna for passion and success in romance. Warriors invoked her for victory in battle—she was \"she who strides across battlefields.\" Kings sought her blessing for legitimate authority. Women prayed for fertility and safe childbirth. Hymns praised her contradictory nature: \"Lady of all powers, light-giving luminary, Inanna, righteous woman clothed in radiance, beloved of Heaven and Earth.\"",
