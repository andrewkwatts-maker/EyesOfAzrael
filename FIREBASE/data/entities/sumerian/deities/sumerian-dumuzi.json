  "longDescription": "The Dying and Rising God, Shepherd of the People\n\nDumuzi is the shepherd god of fertility and vegetation, consort of Inanna. He is the ORIGINAL dying and rising god—his annual death and resurrection predate and influence Osiris, Adonis, Attis, and arguably Christ. His descent to the underworld as Inanna's substitute and his sister's sacrifice to share his fate explain the seasonal cycle: his death brings winter, his return brings spring. His name means \"True Son.\"\n\nDumuzi's myth established the pattern of death, descent, lamentation, and resurrection that echoes through world mythology:\n\nAnnual mourning rituals were performed for Dumuzi (called Tammuz in Akkadian and Hebrew):\n\nDumuzi appears in ancient Sumerian cuneiform texts. Search the ORACC corpus to explore original texts in transliteration and translation.\n\nMajor texts include: \"Inanna's Descent,\" \"Dumuzi's Dream,\" lamentations for Dumuzi",
