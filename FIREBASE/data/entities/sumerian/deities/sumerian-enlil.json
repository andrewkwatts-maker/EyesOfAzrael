  "longDescription": "Lord Wind and Storm, King of Heaven and Earth\n\nEnlil is the most powerful and active god in the Sumerian pantheon. His name means \"Lord Wind\" or \"Lord Storm.\" Son of An, Enlil wields executive power over the cosmos, commanding winds, storms, and the fate of nations. He separated heaven from earth, creating the space for life, and holds the Tablet of Destinies that decrees the fate of gods and mortals.\n\nEnlil is the active force in Sumerian mythology—he creates, destroys, commands, and decides. He embodies both the life-giving spring wind that brings rain and the destructive storm that flattens cities. His word is law among gods and mortals.\n\nEnlil appears in ancient Sumerian cuneiform texts. Search the ORACC corpus to explore original texts in transliteration and translation.\n\nMajor texts include: \"Enlil and Ninlil,\" \"Enlil in the E-kur,\" hymns to Enlil from Nippur\n\nNippur was the religious capital of Sumer and Enlil's primary cult center. The temple Ekur (\"Mountain House\") dominated the city—a massive ziggurat where Enlil's presence dwelled. Nippur was considered neutral ground where city-states could meet. Control of Nippur legitimized a king's rule over all Sumer, as it demonstrated Enlil's favor.\n\nBulls (power and fertility), grain and barley (agricultural bounty), beer and bread (civilization's staples), incense of cedar and myrrh, precious metals and lapis lazuli. As the most powerful active god, Enlil received the highest quality and quantity of offerings. Temple personnel were numerous—Nippur's Ekur employed hundreds of priests, servants, and attendants.\n\nEnlil was invoked for kingship legitimacy, military victory, agricultural abundance, and cosmic order. Royal inscriptions began with praise of Enlil. Prayers emphasized his supreme power: \"Enlil, whose command cannot be altered, whose pronouncement is unchangeable, who forever decrees destinies.\" Farmers prayed for rain; soldiers for victory; kings for the right to rule.",
