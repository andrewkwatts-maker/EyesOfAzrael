The great temple complex E-anna (\"House of Heaven\") was dedicated to An and Inanna. The White Temple atop the ziggurat was An's earthly residence. Uruk was considered the \"beloved city of An.\"\n\nOfferings to An included white bulls (his sacred animal), silver vessels, incense (cedar and myrrh), finest grains and breads, date wine, and precious metals. As the highest god, he received the first portion of all temple offerings before they were distributed to other deities.\n\nAn was invoked as ultimate authority in legal oaths and treaties. Kings swore by An to legitimize their rule.
