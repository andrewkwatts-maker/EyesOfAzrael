  "longDescription": "Lord of Wisdom and the Sweet Waters\n\nEnki is the god of wisdom, fresh water (Abzu), magic, crafts, and creation. He is the benevolent trickster who created humanity with Ninhursag, saved mankind from the flood through cleverness, and possesses all the Me (divine powers). Unlike harsh Enlil, Enki uses intelligence and compassion to help humanity. He represents the life-giving waters that irrigate Mesopotamia and the wellspring of divine knowledge.\n\nEnki embodies wisdom, creativity, and benevolent trickery. He solves problems through intelligence rather than force, and consistently acts as humanity's patron and protector against harsher divine decrees.\n\nThe Abzu (or Apsu) is the underground ocean of fresh water beneath the earth. It is the source of all rivers, wells, and springs—the life-giving water that makes Mesopotamian agriculture possible. Enki rules this realm as his palace and workshop.\n\nIn later Babylonian mythology, the Abzu becomes personified as a primordial god whom Marduk defeats. But in Sumerian tradition, it is simply Enki's domain—the sweet, life-giving waters beneath the world.\n\nEnki appears in numerous ancient Sumerian texts including creation myths, flood narratives, and wisdom literature. Search the ORACC corpus to explore original cuneiform texts mentioning Enki.\n\nMajor texts include: \"Enki and Ninmah,\" \"Atrahasis Epic,\" \"Inanna and Enki,\" \"Enki and Ninhursag,\" \"Enki and the World Order\"\n\nEridu was Enki's primary cult center and the oldest city in Sumerian tradition. The temple E-abzu (\"House of the Abzu\") was built above underground springs, connecting to Enki's watery realm. Eridu was considered the first city ever created, where kingship descended from heaven. Archaeological evidence confirms Eridu's extreme antiquity (settlements dating to c. 5400 BCE).\n\nFish (from his waters), beer (wisdom flows like drink), bread and grain, fine beer (he loves beer!), lapis lazuli (blue stone of wisdom), silver and gold, incense and purifying water. Craftsmen dedicated their finest work to Enki. Scribes invoked him when learning cuneiform. Healers and magicians called upon his name in incantations.\n\nEnki was invoked for wisdom in difficult decisions, protection during floods or drought, healing of disease, success in crafts and arts, magical knowledge and incantations, and fertility of fields (through irrigation). Incantation priests (ashipu) were considered Enki's servants. Medical practitioners called themselves \"sons of Enki.\" His prayers emphasized cleverness, benevolence, and creative problem-solving: \"Enki, whose word is wise counsel, whose understanding is profound, whose plans are deep like the Abzu.\"",
