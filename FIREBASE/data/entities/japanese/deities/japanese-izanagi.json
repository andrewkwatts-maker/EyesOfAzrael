  "shortDescription": "The primordial creator deity who, together with his divine consort Izanami, stirred the cosmic ocean to create the islands of Japan and gave birth to the myriad kami. His mythology encompasses the grandest themes: creation, love, death, loss, and rebirth. From his union with Izanami came the land itself; from his tears came grief; from his purification came the three most noble kami - Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi, and Susanoo. He is both the beginning of all things and the first to experience their ending.",
  "longDescription": "Izanagi's myths are the foundational narratives of Shinto cosmology. His story is one of cosmic creation followed by devastating personal loss, ultimately transformed through ritual purification into new creation. These myths establish core Shinto concepts: the sacredness of land, the power of purification, and the separation between the living and the dead.\n\nAfter creating the land, Izanagi and Izanami gave birth to numerous kami governing all aspects of the world - gods of sea, wind, trees, mountains, rivers, and plains. Their creative union produced the divine framework of nature itself. However, when Izanami gave birth to Kagutsuchi, the fire god, his flames burned her. Despite Izanagi's grief and care, she died from her injuries - the first death among the kami. In his rage and sorrow, Izanagi beheaded Kagutsuchi with his sword Totsuka, and from the fire god's blood and body sprang yet more kami, including thunder gods and mountain deities.\n\nPolluted by his contact with death and the underworld, Izanagi traveled to the river mouth of Tachibana in Himuka (modern Miyazaki Prefecture) to purify himself. As he stripped off his garments and ornaments, various kami were born from each item. As he washed in the water, deities of pollution and purification arose. Finally, washing his face produced the three most noble kami: Amaterasu from his left eye, Tsukuyomi from his right eye, and Susanoo from his nose. This misogi ritual established the fundamental Shinto practice of purification through water.\n\nThis divine spear was given to Izanagi and Izanami by the primordial kami to create the world. By stirring the chaotic ocean with this jeweled weapon, they gathered matter to form the first land. The spear represents the masculine creative principle and the power of heaven to give form to formless chaos. Some traditions identify it with the sacred spear enshrined at Taga Taisha.\n\nIzanagi used this sword to slay Kagutsuchi, the fire god who had killed Izanami. From Kagutsuchi's blood dripping from the blade and his body parts came numerous powerful kami, including various thunder gods. This myth establishes the sword as both destroyer and creator - ending one form of divine life while generating others.\n\nThe massive boulder (Chibiki-no-Iwa or Yomotsu-Oho-Kami, \"Great God of Yomi\") that Izanagi used to seal the entrance to Yomi represents the permanent barrier between the living and the dead. Some traditions identify this site with actual locations in Shimane Prefecture, where shrines mark the legendary boundary.\n\nIzanagi is primarily invoked in the context of purification, creation, and new beginnings. His example established misogi (water purification) as the fundamental Shinto practice for removing pollution and restoring spiritual cleanliness. Couples may pray to Izanagi (and Izanami together) for fertility, creative endeavors, and harmonious marriage - though the awareness of their ultimate separation adds complexity to such prayers. His mythology also makes him significant for those dealing with grief and loss, as he was the first to experience the death of a loved one.\n\nIzanagi's mythology establishes several foundational Shinto concepts:",
