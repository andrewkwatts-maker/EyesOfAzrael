  "title": "Japanese - Raijin",
  "subtitle": "God of Thunder and Lightning",
  "shortDescription": "Raijin is the fearsome kami of thunder, lightning, and storms, one of the most visually striking deities in Japanese mythology. Depicted with demonic features, surrounded by a ring of drums (taiko) that he beats to create thunder, Raijin controls the awesome power of electrical storms. Often paired with Fujin, the wind god, in art and worship, Raijin serves as both a terrifying force of nature and a protective guardian against evil spirits. His image graces countless temples, scrolls, and tatami screens, embodying the raw elemental power that commands respect and fear.",
  "longDescription": "Raijin's mythology is less about narrative myths and more about his essential nature as the personification of thunder itself. He appears in art, folklore, and religious practice as the embodiment of storms' terrifying yet necessary power.\n\nWhile Raijin doesn't have major shrines exclusively dedicated to him like some other major kami, he appears prominently in many Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines as a guardian figure:\n\nRaijin's influence extends far beyond religious worship into Japanese culture broadly. His image appears in traditional tattoo art (irezumi), where he symbolizes power, protection, and respect for nature's forces. In modern popular culture, Raijin-inspired characters appear in video games, manga, and anime as thunder-wielding warriors. The aesthetic of the demonic thunder god beating drums has become one of Japan's most recognizable mythological images worldwide, representing the Japanese understanding that nature's most terrifying forces can also be protective and necessary.",
