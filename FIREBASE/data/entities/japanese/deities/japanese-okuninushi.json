  "title": "Japanese - Okuninushi",
  "subtitle": "Great Master of the Land",
  "shortDescription": "The benevolent deity of nation-building, agriculture, medicine, and magic, Okuninushi is the great civilizer who shaped the land of Japan and taught humanity the arts of survival and prosperity. Through cunning, perseverance, and compassion, he overcame impossible trials to win his bride and build a nation. Though he ultimately ceded rulership of the visible world to Amaterasu's descendants, he remains the supreme lord of the unseen realm, governing the mysterious forces of fate, healing, and the afterlife.",
  "longDescription": "Okuninushi's myths chronicle the transformation of a youngest son, bullied and overlooked, into the master of the Japanese archipelago. Recorded in the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki , his tales emphasize compassion, cleverness, perseverance through trials, and the wisdom to know when to yield power for the greater good.\n\nIzumo Taisha in Shimane Prefecture is the most sacred site dedicated to Okuninushi and one of the oldest and most important shrines in Japan. According to the Kuniyuzuri myth, Amaterasu promised to build this magnificent shrine as part of the agreement for Okuninushi to cede the visible world. The main hall (honden) is the tallest shrine building in Japan, and ancient records suggest it was once even more massive, possibly reaching over 48 meters in height with enormous pillars. The shrine uses the unique taisha-zukuri architectural style, the oldest shrine construction method in Japan.\n\nDuring the 10th lunar month (Kannazuki - \"Month Without Gods\"), all the kami of Japan are believed to gather at Izumo Taisha for a divine assembly where Okuninushi presides over determining the romantic fates and marriages for the coming year. Thus, in Izumo, the 10th month is called Kamiarizuki (\"Month With Gods\"), and Okuninushi is especially venerated as the deity of matchmaking and marriage.\n\nWorship of Okuninushi emphasizes gratitude for civilization's gifts - agriculture, medicine, and social harmony. Uniquely at Izumo Taisha, devotees perform four claps instead of the standard two during prayer (two claps to call the kami, two to express gratitude). Offerings include rice, sake, salt, and medicinal herbs. Couples seeking marriage blessings or marital harmony frequently visit Izumo Taisha, as Okuninushi governs the invisible threads of fate that bind people together. Farmers pray to him for abundant harvests, healers invoke him for medical knowledge, and merchants seek his blessing for prosperity in commerce. The ritual of \"musubi\" (divine connection and binding) is central to his worship, reflecting his role in creating harmonious relationships between humans, nature, and the divine.",
