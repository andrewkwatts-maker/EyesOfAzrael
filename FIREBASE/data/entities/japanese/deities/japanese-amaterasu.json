  "title": "Japanese - Amaterasu",
  "subtitle": "Great Divinity Illuminating Heaven",
  "shortDescription": "The supreme deity of Shinto, Amaterasu is the radiant sun goddess who rules over Takamagahara (the High Plain of Heaven) and serves as the divine ancestor of the Japanese Imperial line. Her light sustains all life, her wisdom guides the kami, and her sacred mirror remains the most treasured of Japan's Imperial Regalia. She embodies purity, benevolence, and the eternal cycle of renewal.",
  "longDescription": "Amaterasu's myths form the cornerstone of Shinto theology and Japanese national identity. Recorded in the Kojiki (712 CE) and Nihon Shoki (720 CE), her stories explain the origins of the sun, the Imperial dynasty, and the fundamental principles of Shinto practice.\n\nThe Ise Grand Shrine in Mie Prefecture is Amaterasu's most sacred dwelling and the holiest site in Shinto. The Inner Shrine (Naiku) houses Yata no Kagami, the sacred mirror that is Amaterasu's primary shintai (divine vessel). The shrine complex has been ritually rebuilt every 20 years for over 1,300 years (Shikinen Sengu), symbolizing eternal renewal. The current structures (rebuilt in 2013) represent the 62nd such rebuilding. Only the Emperor and highest priests may enter the innermost sanctuary.\n\nWorship of Amaterasu emphasizes purity, gratitude, and renewal. Devotees perform temizu (hand washing) purification before approaching shrines. Offerings include rice, sake, salt, and water - the pure essentials of life. The sacred mirror in homes (kamidana) often represents Amaterasu's presence. Prayers (norito) thank her for light, warmth, and life while seeking her continued blessings. The practice of greeting the sunrise (with two claps and a bow) honors her daily appearance.",
