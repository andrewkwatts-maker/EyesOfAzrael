This is not temporal (there was never a time when the Son was not), but describes the eternal relationships within the Godhead .\n\nJesus taught His disciples to pray \"Our Father who art in heaven \" (Matthew 6:9), introducing an unprecedented intimacy with the Almighty . Prayer is offered to the Father , through the Son, in the power of the Spirit.\n\nOur Father , who art in heaven , Hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven . Give us this day our daily bread, And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, Forever and ever. Amen.",
