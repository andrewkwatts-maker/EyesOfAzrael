  "icon": "⚔️",
  "title": "Archangel Michael - Christian Mythology",
  "subtitle": "Prince\n     \n     of the Heavenly Host, Defender Against Evil",
  "shortDescription": "The greatest of all angels, commander of the heavenly armies and champion of God's people. His name, meaning \"Who is like God?\", is itself a rhetorical question affirming God's supremacy. Michael is portrayed as the warrior-protector who defends against the forces of evil, particularly Satan and his demons.",
  "longDescription": "In the Book of Daniel, Michael is identified as the \"great prince who has charge of your people\" and the guardian angel of Israel. He appears to Daniel in visions concerning the end times, engaged in cosmic battles against the angelic princes of Persia and Greece. Michael fights on behalf of God's people against spiritual forces that oppose them.\n\nIn Jude, Michael contends with Satan over the body of Moses. The Book of Revelation describes Michael leading the angelic army in the War in Heaven, casting down the Dragon (Satan) and his rebellious angels from Heaven to Earth. This dramatic victory demonstrates Michael's role as the ultimate defender against evil.\n\nMichael is associated with the end times and the Last Judgment. In some traditions, he is depicted holding the scales that weigh souls, determining their eternal destiny. He is also believed to sound the trumpet announcing the resurrection of the dead and Christ's Second Coming.\n\nThis divine figure embodies the following universal archetypes found across world mythologies:\n\nArchangel warrior, defeats Satan, protector\n\nChief of angelic hosts, heavenly prince",
