  "name": "Freyja",
  "icon": "游눑",
  "title": "Norse - Freya",
  "subtitle": "Goddess of Love, Beauty, Fertility, and Magic",
  "shortDescription": "The most renowned of the Vanir, Freyja is goddess of love, beauty, fertility, gold, death in battle, and seidr magic. She receives half of those who die in combat, rules from her hall Sessrumnir, and taught the Aesir the shamanic art of seidr. Beautiful and fierce, sensual and powerful, she embodies the Vanir's connection to both life's pleasures and its mysteries.",
  "longDescription": "Freyja is a complex goddess who defies simple categorization. She is both love goddess and war goddess, beautiful maiden and powerful seeress, generous giver and fierce protector of what is hers. As a Vanir deity living among the Aesir after the war between the god-tribes, she brought the powerful magic of seidr to Asgard , teaching even Odin its secrets - though some considered this \"women's magic\" shameful for men to practice.\n\nFreyja is the primary practitioner and teacher of seidr, the shamanic magic of the Norse tradition . Seidr involves:\n\nSeidr was primarily practiced by women (v칬lvas or seeresses) and considered ergi (unmanly) for men, yet Odin learned it from Freyja to gain its power. This associates Freyja with the boundary-crossing, norm-breaking aspects of magic and prophecy. See Seidr Magic System for detailed practices.\n\nWhile Odin 's Valhalla is famous as the hall of the slain , Freyja receives half of those who die in battle, choosing her warriors first before Odin claims his share for Valhalla . Her hall is called Sessrumnir (\"seat room\" or \"seat-roomer\"), located in the field F칩lkvangr (\"field of the people\" or \"army field\").\n\nLittle is known about what happens in F칩lkvangr compared to Valhalla 's detailed descriptions, but this division of the war-dead between Freyja and Odin establishes her as equal to the Allfather in claiming honored warriors. Some scholars suggest Freyja 's choice came first, as the preeminent Vanir deity, with her portion perhaps connected to fertility and rebirth rather than Odin 's preparations for Ragnarok .\n\nThis dual claim on the battle-slain reflects the Aesir-Vanir merger: Odin (Aesir) and Freyja (Vanir) both honor warriors but may represent different aspects of death - Odin as collector of heroes for the final battle, Freyja as goddess who transforms death into new life.\n\nSome scholars debate whether Freyja and Frigg ( Odin 's wife) were originally the same goddess or separate deities . Both are associated with Friday, both connected to Odin , both practice magic ( Frigg spins fate, Freyja practices seidr), and both have husband-figures who wander. They may represent different aspects of a Great Goddess, or distinct deities whose cults overlapped, especially during the transition to Christianity when both were merged with Venus/ Frigg -day/Friday.\n\nFreyja was worshipped throughout Scandinavia, with particular devotion in Sweden where the Vanir cult was strongest. Her worship involved groves sacred to love and fertility, places where v칬lvas practiced seidr, and sites associated with gold and amber. Unlike war gods honored with weapons, Freyja received offerings of flowers, honey, mead, and gold. Place names like Fr칬vi (Sweden) preserve her cult locations.\n\nFreyja received offerings of mead, honey, flowers (especially primrose and roses), gold and amber jewelry, cakes and sweet foods, flax (sacred to her), and sometimes swine (her sacred animal). V칬lvas practicing seidr in her name made offerings before trance work. Love charms and beauty spells invoked her name. Unlike the blood sacrifices given to Odin and Thor , Freyja 's offerings emphasized beauty, sweetness, and sensuality.\n\nFreyja was invoked for matters of love, beauty, fertility (both human and agricultural), success in magic, prophetic dreams, and protection of women. Brides called on her for happy marriages. Warriors might invoke her as war-goddess for courage and honor in death. Seidr practitioners began their work with prayers to Freyja . Young women seeking love wore her symbols. Her name was used in love poems and seduction charms throughout the medieval period.",
