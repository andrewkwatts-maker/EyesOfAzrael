  "subtitle": "God of War, Justice, and Oaths",
  "shortDescription": "The one-handed god of law, justice, and honorable combat. Tyr sacrificed his sword hand to bind the monstrous wolf Fenrir , an act of courage and self-sacrifice that exemplifies his role as guardian of cosmic order and keeper of oaths.",
  "longDescription": "Tyr is one of the oldest gods in the Norse pantheon, possibly predating Odin as a chief war deity. He represents the lawful and honorable aspects of warfare, in contrast to Odin 's more cunning and ruthless approach. Tyr 's willingness to sacrifice himself for the greater good makes him a model of courage and integrity.\n\nAt Ragnarok , Tyr will face Garmr, the great hound that guards the gates of Helheim. They will slay each other in single combat, a fitting end for a god of honorable warfare. His death represents the final failure of law and order to contain the forces of chaos.",
