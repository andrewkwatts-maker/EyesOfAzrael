  "title": "Norse - Odin",
  "subtitle": "The\n     \n      Allfather\n     \n     , God of Wisdom and War",
  "shortDescription": "The one-eyed wanderer who sacrificed himself to himself, hung on the World Tree for nine nights to gain the runes, and rules Asgard with wisdom bought through suffering. King of the Aesir, lord of Valhalla , patron of poets, shamans, and warriors who seek glory through death.",
  "longDescription": "Odin is the most complex and paradoxical of the Norse gods - simultaneously wise and ruthless, noble and treacherous, lawgiver and oath-breaker. Unlike Thor who protects humanity directly, Odin 's concern is cosmic: gathering knowledge and warriors to delay the inevitable doom of Ragnarok . He wanders Middle-earth disguised as an old man with a wide-brimmed hat, testing the hospitality and wisdom of mortals.\n\nOdin and Loki are blood-brothers by oath, despite Loki being a giant's son. This paradoxical relationship - Odin accepting Loki into Asgard despite knowing prophecies of betrayal - may reflect Odin 's understanding that chaos and order must coexist. Odin benefits from Loki 's cunning while knowing it will ultimately contribute to Ragnarok .\n\nOld Uppsala in Sweden was a major cult center for Odin worship. Temples (hof) dedicated to him featured prominently in Viking Age Scandinavia. Sacred groves where warriors were hanged as offerings to Odin existed across Norse territories. Battlefields themselves became his temples, as the honored dead were his chosen.\n\nOdin received the most intense sacrifices: warriors hanged on trees or impaled with spears, dedicated \"to Odin .\" Mead and ale poured in his honor. Poetry and rune-carving as devotional acts. The custom of spilling the first drink for the gods honored Odin first. Weapons cast into sacred waters or buried in bogs. Unlike Thor who received common folk's prayers , Odin was invoked by jarls, kings, poets, and warriors seeking glory in death.\n\nPrayers to Odin were rarely for safety or peaceful prosperity - these belonged to Thor and Freyr . Instead, devotees sought wisdom, poetic inspiration, victory in battle, or knowledge of runes and magic. The dying prayer of a warrior dedicated to Odin was \"I am coming to Valhalla .\" Rune masters invoked him when carving and empowering runes. Seidr practitioners and v칬lvas called upon him for prophetic visions, though seidr was primarily Freyja's domain.\n\nOdin 's great hall Valhalla (\" hall of the slain \") stands in Asgard with 540 doors, each wide enough for 800 warriors to march through abreast. Here dwell the Einherjar - warriors chosen by Odin 's Valkyries from among the battle-dead. Each day they fight and kill each other in combat training; each evening their wounds heal and they feast on endless meat and mead served by the Valkyries.\n\nThis is not heaven but Odin 's army, gathered for Ragnarok . The Allfather knows the gods will fall, but he strives nonetheless to gather the greatest warriors to his side. He accepts that fate (wyrd) cannot be escaped, yet he prepares for the final battle. This paradox - fighting while knowing defeat is inevitable - represents the core Norse virtue of facing doom with courage and honor.",
