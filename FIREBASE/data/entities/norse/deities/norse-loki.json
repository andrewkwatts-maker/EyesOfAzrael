  "title": "Norse - Loki",
  "subtitle": "The Trickster, Agent of Chaos",
  "shortDescription": "The shapeshifter and trickster who dwells among the gods despite being a giant's son. Blood-brother to Odin , father of monsters , helper and betrayer of the Aesir. His cunning brings both salvation and doom to the gods, culminating in the death of Baldr and his binding until Ragnarok .",
  "longDescription": "Loki is the most complex and contradictory figure in Norse mythology - neither fully evil nor good, neither god nor giant, but something in between. He is a necessary force of chaos that tests the gods and pushes them to adapt, but ultimately his role leads to the destruction of the cosmos at Ragnarok .\n\nLoki 's relationships with the gods are deeply ambiguous. He is Odin 's blood-brother, Thor 's occasional companion, and has saved the gods multiple times through his cunning. Yet he also causes many of their problems, often solving issues he himself created. This paradox makes him essential yet dangerous to divine order.\n\nAt Ragnarok , Loki will break free from his bonds and lead the giants and monsters against the gods. He will captain the ship Naglfar, made from the fingernails of the dead, carrying the giants to the final battle. Loki and Heimdall will kill each other in combat, fulfilling their ancient enmity.",
