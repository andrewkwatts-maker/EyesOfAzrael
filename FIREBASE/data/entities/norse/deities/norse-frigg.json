  "title": "Norse - Frigg",
  "subtitle": "Queen of\n     \n      Asgard\n     \n     , Goddess of Marriage and Motherhood",
  "shortDescription": "Wife of Odin and queen of the Aesir, Frigg is goddess of marriage, motherhood, domestic life, and foresight. She knows all fates but speaks no prophecies. From her hall Fensalir, she spins the clouds and watches over families and households. The only goddess permitted to sit on Odin 's throne Hlidskjalf, she shares his all-seeing vision across the Nine Realms.",
  "longDescription": "Frigg is often described in the sources as knowing all fates yet choosing not to reveal them - a powerful wisdom that comes with the burden of foresight. As Odin 's wife and queen, she rules Asgard alongside him, though her focus is domestic harmony and maternal protection rather than war and wisdom-seeking. She is foremost among the Asynjur (goddesses) and commands respect from all the Aesir.\n\nScholars debate the relationship between Frigg and Freyja . Both are associated with Friday ( Frigg 's Day/ Freyja 's Day), both have connections to Odin , both practice forms of magic ( Frigg spins fate, Freyja practices seidr), and both have husbands who wander ( Odin and Óðr). Some theories:\n\nWhat is clear is that Frigg represents the married, maternal aspect of feminine divine power, while Freyja represents the erotic and martial aspects - potentially two faces of complementary power.\n\nFrigg 's hall is called Fensalir (\"Marsh Halls\" or \"Water Halls\"), suggesting a connection to marshes, mists, and watery places. Here she sits with her handmaidens, spinning clouds and watching over domestic affairs across the realms. The hall represents the domestic sphere writ large - just as a housewife rules her home, Frigg rules from Fensalir with quiet but absolute authority.\n\nHer attendants include:\n\nFrigg was worshipped throughout the Germanic world, though her cult is less well-documented than Odin 's or Thor 's. Place names preserve her memory, and she was invoked in domestic settings - the home itself was her temple. Married women particularly honored her, seeking her blessings for family harmony, children, and household prosperity.\n\nFrigg received offerings of flax and wool (her domain as spinner), household items, keys (symbol of her domestic authority), and silver. Married women dedicated their spinning work to her. The first portion of newly woven cloth might be offered at her shrine. Unlike warrior gods receiving blood sacrifice, Frigg 's offerings were peaceful - bread, cheese, ale, woven goods, and prayers for family welfare.\n\nFrigg was invoked for marital harmony, conception and safe childbirth, protection of children, domestic peace, and success in household tasks. Wives swore oaths by Frigg . Her name was called upon to seal marriage contracts. Mothers facing difficult childbirth called on her as the mother-goddess who understood their pain. \" Frigg 's eyes\" (a kenning for stars) were invoked for protection through the night.",
