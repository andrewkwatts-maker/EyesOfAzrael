  "longDescription": "The Wise Lord, Supreme Creator\n\nThe uncreated, omniscient, and all-powerful deity who represents ultimate truth, light, and goodness. Ahura Mazda is the supreme creator who fashioned the universe through wisdom and will ultimately triumph over evil in the Frashokereti.\n\nAhura Mazda is not born but has always existed - the uncreated creator, dwelling in infinite light. In the beginning, there were two primordial spirits who made opposite choices: Spenta Mainyu (Holy Spirit, an aspect of Ahura Mazda) chose Asha (truth) and goodness, while Angra Mainyu chose Druj (lie) and destruction. This primordial choice defines the fundamental duality of existence.\n\nAt the beginning of time, Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu existed in an unlimited void. Ahura Mazda dwelt in infinite light, Angra Mainyu in infinite darkness. When they met, Ahura Mazda, knowing all futures, offered Angra Mainyu a choice to join in creating good. Angra Mainyu refused and declared eternal opposition. This established the cosmic war that will last 12,000 years, culminating in the Frashokereti (final renovation).\n\nAhura Mazda created the world in spiritual form first (menog), then manifested it physically (getig). He created the seven Amesha Spentas as emanations of his own virtues, then fashioned the material world in six stages: sky (metal), water, earth, plants, animals, and finally humanity. Each creation was made perfect and good, reflecting the divine order of Asha.\n\nAhura Mazda revealed himself to the prophet Zoroaster (Zarathustra) in a series of seven visions, teaching him the true religion and the path of Asha. Through Zoroaster, humanity received the knowledge needed to choose good over evil through good thoughts (humata), good words (hukhta), and good deeds (hvarshta).\n\nAhura Mazda's nature is expressed through the seven Amesha Spentas (Bounteous Immortals), divine emanations that represent his core attributes:\n\nAll fire temples (Atash Bahram) are dedicated to Ahura Mazda, as fire represents his divine light and wisdom. The sacred fire must never be extinguished and is fed with sandalwood, cypress, and other fragrant woods. Major fire temples include Atash Behram of Yazd, Udvada, and historical temples at Persepolis.\n\nAshem Vohu: \"Righteousness is the best good. It is radiant happiness. Radiant happiness comes to the person to whom righteousness is for the sake of best righteousness alone.\" (Recited for blessings and protection)\n\nAhuna Vairya (Yatha Ahu Vairyo): The most sacred prayer, believed to have been spoken by Ahura Mazda at creation. It declares his sovereignty and the primacy of Asha.\n\nAhunwar: A powerful protective prayer invoking Ahura Mazda's authority over evil.\n\nFollowers of Ahura Mazda must walk the Threefold Path:\n\nAfter death, souls cross the Chinvat Bridge, judged by Rashnu, Mithra, and Sraosha. Those who followed Ahura Mazda's path reach the House of Song (paradise), while those who chose evil fall to the House of Lies.\n\nAhura Mazda worship profoundly influenced the development of monotheism in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Key concepts that spread from Zoroastrianism include:",
