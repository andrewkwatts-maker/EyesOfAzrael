  "longDescription": "Sacred Union\n\nA man and woman stand naked in Eden, blessed by the angel Raphael above. Behind the woman grows the Tree of Knowledge with the serpent , behind the man the Tree of Life. This is the card of choices made from love, the union of opposites, and the moment Adam chose Eve over paradise—a choice that brought both suffering and consciousness.\n\nLove, union, relationships, choices, values alignment, harmony, attraction, partnership, sacred marriage. The Lovers announces a significant choice, usually in matters of the heart but also in values and loyalties. This is the choice to commit, to merge with another, to create partnership. It can also represent the integration of inner masculine and feminine.\n\nDisharmony, misalignment, poor choices, separation, values conflict, lust without love. When reversed , the Lovers indicates choosing based on superficial attraction rather than deep compatibility, or being unable to choose, frozen between options. Sometimes indicates the breakdown of a relationship or choosing security over love.\n\nThe Lovers represents the path from Binah (Understanding, the Mother) to Tiferet (Beauty, the Heart). This is the descent of divine understanding into harmonious manifestation through conscious choice. The angel Raphael (healing) blesses the union. The Lovers teaches that consciousness arose through relationship—Adam alone in paradise was unconscious; only through choosing Eve and tasting the fruit of knowledge did humanity awaken.\n\nThis deity embodies the following universal archetypes found across world mythologies:\n\nUnion, relationships, choices of the heart",
