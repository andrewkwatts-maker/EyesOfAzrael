  "subtitle": "God of War\n     \n     , Bloodlust, and Violence",
  "shortDescription": "The fierce god of war in its brutal aspect - bloodshed, violence, and the chaos of battle. Unlike Athena who represents strategic warfare, Ares embodies raw physical aggression and the savage thrill of combat.",
  "longDescription": "Ares appears frequently in Greek myth but is often portrayed unfavorably - as cowardly when wounded, beaten by mortals, or mocked by other gods for his brutish nature and lack of wisdom.\n\nUnlike other Olympians, Ares had relatively few temples in Greece, reflecting his unpopularity. Sparta honored him more than other cities, as befits a warrior culture. Thebes also had an important cult of Ares . His primary worship occurred in Thrace, considered his homeland.\n\nWarriors dedicated armor and weapons from defeated enemies to Ares . Dogs and boars were sacrificed before battle. In Sparta, captured armor was hung in his temple. Blood offerings were common, befitting the god of bloodshed.\n\nSoldiers invoked Ares before battle for courage and strength. However, prayers often sought to avoid his destructive influence rather than invoke it. The Spartans prayed to him not for victory but for courage in battle.",
