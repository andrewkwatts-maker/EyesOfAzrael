  "shortDescription": "Ruler of the underworld and keeper of the dead, Hades is one of the three great brothers who divided the cosmos. Though feared and rarely worshipped openly, he maintains the balance between life and death, ensuring souls reach their proper destination.",
  "longDescription": "Hades rules the realm of the dead with stern but fair justice. Unlike his brothers Zeus and Poseidon who actively involve themselves in mortal affairs, Hades remains in his dark kingdom, rarely leaving except on essential business.\n\nHades had few temples as Greeks feared to invoke his name. Most worship occurred at necropolises (cities of the dead) or at sites associated with entrances to the underworld , such as caves and deep chasms. The oracle at Epirus consulted the dead through rituals to Hades .\n\nBlack animals (sheep, cattle) were sacrificed with their blood poured into the earth. Unlike offerings to Olympian gods, sacrifices to Hades were completely burned or buried rather than shared in feasts. Libations of water, wine, milk, and honey were poured for the dead. Worshippers would avert their faces during Hades ' rituals.\n\nGreeks rarely spoke Hades ' name, using epithets like \" Pluto \" (The Wealthy One) to avoid attracting his attention. Prayers typically sought to keep him at bay or to ensure safe passage for the deceased. The dead themselves were invoked through Hades in necromantic rituals.",
