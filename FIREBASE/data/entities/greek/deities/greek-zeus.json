  "title": "Greek - Zeus",
  "subtitle": "King of the Gods, God of Sky and Thunder",
  "shortDescription": "Supreme ruler of Mount Olympus and the Greek pantheon, Zeus commands the sky, hurls thunderbolts, and upholds cosmic justice. As father of gods and men , he embodies sovereignty, law, and divine authority .",
  "longDescription": "Zeus 's mythology spans the entire Greek cosmos—from the overthrow of the Titans to countless interactions with mortals. His stories reveal the nature of divine power, justice, and the relationship between gods and humanity.\n\nZeus 's relationships with mortals—both romantic and judicial—fill Greek mythology. He famously transformed himself to seduce mortal women: appearing as a swan to Leda, a bull to Europa, a shower of gold to Danaë, and a mortal husband to Alkmene. These unions produced many of Greece's greatest heroes, including Perseus , Heracles , and Helen of Troy. As upholder of xenia (guest-friendship) and justice, Zeus punished oath-breakers and those who showed hubris (excessive pride), but also protected supplicants and strangers.\n\nZeus 's most famous oracle was at Dodona in Epirus, where priestesses interpreted the rustling of sacred oak leaves. The Olympic sanctuary at Olympia housed his massive gold and ivory statue by Phidias (one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World) and hosted the Olympic Games every four years in his honor. Major temples also stood at Athens, Sparta, and throughout the Greek world. Mount Olympus itself, though rarely visited by mortals, was considered his primary dwelling.\n\nZeus received the grandest sacrifices: hecatombs (literally \"hundred oxen,\" though the number was often symbolic) of cattle and bulls, their fat and bones burned on altars while choice portions were consumed by worshippers in communal feasts. White animals were preferred. Libations of wine accompanied prayers . Oaths were sworn in Zeus 's name with dire consequences for oath-breakers. Suppliant branches were laid at his altars when seeking protection or justice.\n\nZeus was invoked as witness to oaths, protector of guests ( Zeus Xenios), guardian of the city ( Zeus Polieus), and upholder of justice. Prayers typically began with his epithets acknowledging his specific aspect being petitioned. Supplicants would raise hands skyward when praying to Zeus , as he dwells in the heavens. The proper formula included reminding Zeus of past offerings and service, then stating the request.",
