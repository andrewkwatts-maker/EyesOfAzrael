He traveled extensively, bringing the gift of wine and his mystery cult to lands far beyond Greece.\n\nDionysus was worshipped throughout Greece, with major cult centers at Thebes (his birthplace), Athens (where the theater festivals honored him), and Delphi (where he was said to reside in winter when Apollo was absent). Natural settings like mountains and forests were also sacred to him.\n\nWine libations, ivy wreaths, grape vines, and theatrical performances. Goats were sacrificed (the word \"tragedy\" comes from \"tragos\" - goat). His rituals involved music, dance, and the consumption of wine to achieve altered states of consciousness.\n\nThe Dionysian Mysteries promised initiates spiritual transformation through ritual ecstasy. These secret rites involved nocturnal processions, sacrifice, dancing, and symbolic death and rebirth. Women (Maenads) performed ecstatic dances on mountains, entering trance states.",
