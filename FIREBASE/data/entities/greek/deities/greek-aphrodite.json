  "longDescription": "Aphrodite 's mythology centers on love, desire, and the complications that arise from both. Her influence causes mortals and immortals to fall in love, sometimes with disastrous consequences.\n\nAphrodite 's primary cult centers were on Cyprus (especially Paphos, where she was said to have come ashore) and Cythera. Major temples also existed at Corinth (where temple prostitution was practiced), Athens, and throughout the Greek world. Her sanctuaries were often near the sea or in gardens.\n\nWorshippers offered flowers (especially roses and myrtle), perfumes, incense, doves, and personal items of beauty. Her altars received garlands and wreaths. Unlike gods receiving blood sacrifices, offerings to Aphrodite emphasized beauty, fragrance, and sensual pleasure.\n\nAphrodite was invoked for matters of love, marriage, fertility, and beauty. Prayers often appealed to her power over desire and her ability to grant favor in romantic pursuits. Sailors also prayed to her for safe sea voyages, honoring her birth from the sea.",
