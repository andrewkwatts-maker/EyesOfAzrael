  "title": "Greek - Hera",
  "subtitle": "Queen of the Gods, Goddess of Marriage and\n     \n      Family",
  "shortDescription": "Wife and sister of Zeus , Hera rules as Queen of Olympus and protector of marriage, women, and childbirth. Though her mythology is dominated by Zeus 's infidelities and her vengeful responses, she represents the sacred institution of marriage and the sovereignty of divine queenship.",
  "longDescription": "Hera 's mythology centers on her tumultuous marriage to Zeus , her fierce protection of marital sanctity, and her vengeful pursuit of Zeus 's lovers and illegitimate children. Yet she also represents legitimate sovereignty and the power of the divine queen.\n\nHera 's wrath toward Zeus 's lovers and their children fills Greek mythology . She transformed Io into a cow and set the hundred-eyed Argus to watch her. She tricked Semele into demanding Zeus reveal his true form, causing Semele's death. She delayed Leto's childbirth for nine days and sent the serpent Python to pursue her. She drove the nymph Echo mad, leaving her only able to repeat others' words. While modern readers often view Hera as jealous, ancient Greeks understood her as defending the sanctity of marriage and her own honor as Queen of Heaven .\n\nHera 's most important sanctuary was the Heraion at Argos, one of the oldest and grandest temples in Greece, where a massive chryselephantine statue rivaled those at Athens and Olympia. The Heraion of Samos, on her legendary birthplace, housed another magnificent temple. Major sanctuaries also existed at Olympia (separate from Zeus 's temple), Corinth, Sparta, and throughout the Greek world. Annual processions and festivals celebrated her divine marriage and queenship.\n\nHera received offerings of cows (hecatombs), pomegranates (symbol of marriage and fertility), honey cakes, and libations of wine and milk. Brides offered locks of hair before marriage. Married women dedicated clothing and jewelry. Peacock feathers adorned her altars. Temples displayed votive offerings from women seeking successful childbirth, marital harmony, or vindication against unfaithful spouses. As Queen of Heaven , she received magnificent gifts befitting her status.\n\nWomen invoked Hera for protection during childbirth ( Hera Eileithyia), blessing at marriage ( Hera Gamelia), and marital fidelity. Queens and noblewomen sought her blessing for sovereignty and authority . Prayers emphasized her as protector of legitimate unions and families. Married couples invoked her together during wedding ceremonies. Women betrayed by unfaithful husbands might pray for her vengeful justice, as she understood such betrayal personally.",
