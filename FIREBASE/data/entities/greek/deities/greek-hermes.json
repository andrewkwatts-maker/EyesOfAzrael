  "title": "Greek - Hermes",
  "subtitle": "Messenger of the Gods, God of Travel, Commerce, and Thieves",
  "shortDescription": "Fleet-footed messenger of the Olympian gods, Hermes is the divine herald, psychopomp, patron of travelers, merchants, thieves, and eloquence. Wearing winged sandals and carrying the herald's staff, he moves freely between worlds, guiding souls to the underworld and delivering divine messages to mortals.",
  "longDescription": "Hermes is the cleverest and most mischievous of the Olympians, displaying extraordinary cunning from the day of his birth. As messenger god and psychopomp, he alone moves freely between the mortal world, Olympus, and the underworld, making him an essential bridge between realms.\n\nOne of Hermes 's most important roles is guiding the souls of the dead to the underworld. With his caduceus in hand, he leads the newly departed from the world of the living across the River Styx to Hades ' realm. He guided Eurydice back to the underworld when Orpheus looked back too soon, and escorted Persephone between the upper and lower worlds each year. Unlike death itself (Thanatos), Hermes provides safe passage and transition, making death a journey rather than an ending.\n\nHermes was worshipped throughout Greece, particularly at crossroads and boundaries. Herms (stone pillars topped with his head and adorned with a phallus) marked roads, property boundaries, and city gates across the Greek world. Major sanctuaries stood on Mount Cyllene in Arcadia (his birthplace) and in the gymnasium and agora of every Greek city, where he presided over commerce and athletic training.\n\nHermes received offerings of honey cakes, wine, and incense at herms and crossroads. Merchants dedicated a portion of profits to him. Travelers left shoes, staffs, and small tokens asking for safe passage. Young men offered locks of hair when entering adulthood. Libations were poured before important speeches, invoking his gift of eloquence.\n\nHermes was invoked by travelers embarking on journeys, merchants conducting business, thieves (who claimed him as patron), heralds delivering messages, athletes before competitions, and those seeking persuasive speech. He was also called upon to guide the souls of the deceased safely to the underworld, and to deliver messages to the gods on behalf of mortals.",
