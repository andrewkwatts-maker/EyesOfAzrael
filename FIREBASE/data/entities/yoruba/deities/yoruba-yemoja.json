  "title": "Yoruba - Yemoja - Mother of Waters and Fertility",
  "subtitle": "Great Mother Orisha of the Ocean, Rivers, Fertility, and Motherhood",
  "shortDescription": "The universal mother who gave birth to many of the Orisha, Yemoja is the great nurturer and protector. Her realm is the ocean and the Ogun River in Nigeria. She embodies the deep, mysterious, life-giving power of the waters. Yemoja fiercely protects women, especially pregnant women and mothers, and all who dwell near the sea. Her embrace is like the ocean - vast, nurturing, and capable of tremendous power when her children are threatened.",
  "longDescription": "Yemoja's pataki reveal her as the primordial mother, the source of life, and a fierce protector. In Nigeria, she is associated with the Ogun River; in the diaspora, she rules the ocean itself - the great waters that carried her children to new lands.\n\nIn one origin story, Yemoja's body swelled until it could contain no more. When she burst, the waters flooded forth to create the rivers and oceans. From her womb came many of the major Orisha - Shango, Ogun, Oshun, Oya, and others (the specific children vary by tradition). Her body became the earth, and her breasts became two hills from which flow the source of the Ogun River. This myth establishes Yemoja as the primordial mother from whom life itself flows.\n\nYemoja was once married to Orunmila, the Orisha of wisdom and divination. She was his first wife and helped him establish the Ifa system. However, Orunmila forbade her from touching his sacred divination implements. One day, curious about her husband's powers, Yemoja secretly used the ikin (palm nuts). When Orunmila discovered this, he banished her. Heartbroken, Yemoja went to live in the river, taking with her knowledge of divination. This is why women can become Iyanifa (female diviners) and why water is used in many divination rituals.\n\nA young woman was being pursued by an evil spirit who wished to steal her unborn child. She ran and ran until she reached the river's edge with nowhere to go. Crying out to Yemoja, she threw herself into the water. But instead of drowning, she felt the Great Mother's arms embrace her. Yemoja carried her downstream to safety and killed the evil spirit with her waves. When the woman gave birth, Yemoja blessed the child. This is why pregnant women pray to Yemoja for protection, and why births in Yoruba tradition are often accompanied by offerings to the water.\n\nYemoja and Olokun (Orisha of the deep ocean) have a complex relationship. In some traditions, Olokun is Yemoja's mother or father; in others, they are aspects of the same force. Olokun rules the unfathomable depths - the mysteries beyond human comprehension. Yemoja rules the surface and the waters that touch the shore - the aspect of the sea that interacts with humanity. Together they represent the full power of the ocean, from sunlit waves to the abyss where no light reaches.\n\nWhen her children were stolen from Africa and forced onto slave ships, Yemoja wept. Her tears filled the Atlantic Ocean with her sorrow. But she did not abandon her children - she followed them across the water, protecting those she could, receiving those who died at sea into her watery embrace. In the Americas, she is honored as the spirit who accompanied the enslaved across the ocean and who continues to protect her children in the diaspora. This is why she is so powerfully venerated in Cuba, Brazil, and throughout the Caribbean.\n\nYemoja is called the mother of many Orisha, though which Orisha are her children varies by lineage:\n\nThunder and Lightning\n\nIron and War\n\nFresh Water and Love\n\nWind and Transformation\n\nVegetables and Gardens\n\nHunting and Justice\n\nPrimary offering\n\nHer sacred creatures\n\nHer favorite fruit\n\nSweet offerings\n\nEspecially white roses\n\nObi\n\nWhite corn\n\nFloral scents\n\nIn Nigeria, Yemoja's primary sacred site is the Ogun River in Ogun State, where an annual festival is held. The river's source at the hills is considered especially sacred. In the diaspora, the ocean itself is her shrine - devotees make offerings at the beach, especially at sunset or during the full moon.\n\nThe Yemoja Festival in Abeokuta, Nigeria, is a major annual celebration featuring processions to the river, offerings of food and flowers, and prayers for fertility and protection. In Brazil, Festa de Iemanja on February 2nd sees millions of people at beaches offering flowers, perfume, and mirrors to the sea. In Rio, boats carry offerings to be thrown into the ocean.\n\nYemoja is one of the most beloved Orisha in the Americas. Her image as the nurturing mother who crossed the Atlantic with her children gives her special significance in diaspora communities. She represents the connection to Africa that survived the Middle Passage.\n\nCalled Yemaya . Syncretized with Our Lady of Regla (a Black Madonna whose church is at Havana's harbor). She has many \"caminos\" (paths) - Yemaya Okute (warrior aspect), Yemaya Olokun (deep ocean), Yemaya Asesu (messenger). Colors: blue and white. Initiation involves elaborate ceremonies near water.\n\nCalled Iemanja . Queen of the sea, one of the most popular Orixa. February 2nd (Festa de Iemanja) is a national celebration. Offerings of flowers, mirrors, and perfume are sent to sea on small boats. Syncretized with Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception. The mermaid image is strongly associated with her.\n\nKnown as La Siren (The Mermaid) and Agwe's wife. She represents the sea itself. Ceremonies include offerings to the ocean. She may possess devotees during rituals, causing them to move as if swimming. Her songs are among the most beautiful in the tradition.\n\nCalled Yemanja or Emanja . Associated with the sea and motherhood. Ceremonies for her are held at beaches. She is called upon for fertility, protection of children, and safe sea travel. Her colors are blue and white.\n\nYemoja is called upon for:\n\nBut Yemoja is not only gentle. Like the sea, she can be terrible in her wrath. Those who harm children or mothers may feel her fury in drownings, floods, and storms. The ocean that nurtures can also destroy.",
