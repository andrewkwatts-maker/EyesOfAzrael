  "fullDescription": "Crete is the largest Greek island, central to numerous myths. Most famously, Rhea hid the infant Zeus in a cave on Crete (either Dictaean or Idaean Cave) to protect him from his father Cronos. The Kouretes danced and clashed shields to drown Zeus's cries. Zeus was nursed by the goat Amalthea and raised by nymphs. Later, Zeus brought Europa to Crete in the form of a bull—their sons included King Minos. Minos ruled Crete and commissioned Daedalus to build the Labyrinth housing the Minotaur (offspring of Minos's wife and Poseidon's bull). Historically, Crete was home to the Minoan civilization, Europe's first great Bronze Age culture, whose advanced society may have inspired myths of a golden age.",
