  "fullDescription": "Mount Fuji (富士山, Fujisan), standing at 3,776 meters, is Japan's highest mountain and most sacred peak. In mythology, Mount Fuji is closely associated with Konohanasakuya-hime, the blossom princess and wife of Ninigi (grandson of Amaterasu). According to the Taketori Monogatari (Tale of the Bamboo Cutter), the mountain's name derives from 'immortal' (fushi) or 'never dying,' as the elixir of immortality was burned at its summit. Shinto tradition holds that Konohanasakuya-hime dwells within the volcano, her presence manifested in the mountain's fire and beauty. The mountain has been a site of pilgrimage for centuries, with climbers seeking spiritual purification and communion with the kami. Fuji is considered the boundary between earth and heaven, a sacred axis mundi connecting the physical and spiritual realms. The mountain's perfect symmetrical cone represents cosmic harmony and divine perfection.",
