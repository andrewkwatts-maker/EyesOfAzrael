  "fullDescription": "The Underworld (Greek: Ἅιδης Hades, or Ἔρεβος Erebus) is the dark realm beneath the earth where mortal souls journey after death. Ruled by Hades and his queen Persephone, the Underworld contains multiple regions including the Asphodel Meadows (for ordinary souls), Elysium (paradise for heroes), and Tartarus (prison for the wicked and Titans). Souls must cross the River Styx, ferried by Charon, and pass the three-headed dog Cerberus guarding the gates. The three judges—Minos, Rhadamanthus, and Aeacus—determine each soul's final destination. The Underworld is not merely punishment but the inevitable destiny of all mortals, reflecting Greek acceptance of death's universality. Heroes like Orpheus, Heracles, and Odysseus descended to the Underworld while still living, making the katabasis (descent) journey central to Greek mythology.",

      "symbolism": "The Underworld symbolizes death's inevitability and democracy—all mortals, regardless of status, descend to Hades. The journey represents life's final transition, the ultimate unknown. Multiple regions reflect Greek belief in posthumous justice and reward/punishment. The Underworld's darkness symbolizes death as opposite of life's light, yet not inherently evil—merely the natural end. Heroes' descents (katabasis) symbolize facing mortality, confronting fears, and gaining wisdom from death's realm.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Greek Underworld concepts profoundly influenced Western views of afterlife, judgment, and death. The River Styx, Charon's ferry, and Cerberus became archetypal afterlife imagery. 'Crossing the Styx,' 'Hades,' and 'going to Erebus' entered common language for death. The concept influenced later Jewish Sheol, Christian Hell/Purgatory, and countless literary afterlife depictions from Dante to modern fantasy."
