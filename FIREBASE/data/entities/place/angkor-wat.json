  "fullDescription": "Angkor Wat (Khmer: អង្គរវត្ត, meaning 'City of Temples') is the largest religious monument in the world, covering approximately 162.6 hectares (402 acres). Built in the early 12th century (1113-1150 CE) by Khmer King Suryavarman II, it was originally constructed as a Hindu temple dedicated to Vishnu, but gradually transformed into a Buddhist temple by the end of the 12th century. The temple complex represents the pinnacle of classical Khmer architecture and has become a symbol of Cambodia, appearing on the national flag. The architecture is designed to represent Mount Meru, the home of the gods in Hindu mythology, with its five towers symbolizing the mountain's five peaks, surrounded by walls representing the mountains at the edge of the world, and the moat representing the cosmic ocean.",

The three enclosures symbolize the three levels of heaven, the moat represents the cosmic ocean, and walls represent the mountain ranges at the world's edge. The entire complex functions as a three-dimensional mandala and microcosm of the universe. The Churning of the Ocean of Milk relief symbolizes the cosmic struggle to obtain amrita (immortality), with devas and asuras cooperating despite opposition. Western orientation (unusual for Khmer temples) associates it with Vishnu and death, suggesting funerary function. Apsara carvings represent celestial beauty and divine attendants emerged from the churning. The temple encodes Vedic mathematics, astronomical alignments, and sacred geometry.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Angkor Wat represents the pinnacle of classical Khmer architecture and the power of the Khmer Empire at its zenith. The temple demonstrates sophisticated engineering, artistic achievement, and theological knowledge. Construction required mobilizing massive labor forces and resources, reflecting state power and divine kingship ideology (devaraja cult). The temple preserved Hindu epics and mythology in Southeast Asian context, adapting Indian traditions to local Khmer culture. Angkor Wat's endurance as a living religious site (continuously maintained by Buddhist monks) ensured cultural continuity through centuries of political change."

      "culturalSignificance": "Angkor Wat's transformation to Buddhism demonstrates religious syncretism and continuity in Southeast Asian spirituality. Buddhist monks' continuous maintenance preserved the temple when royal patronage disappeared. Today, Angkor Wat serves as living Buddhist pilgrimage site while preserving Hindu heritage, embodying Cambodia's religious evolution. The temple bridges ancient Hindu kingdom and contemporary Theravada Buddhist nation."

The temple generates national pride, international recognition, and economic benefits (tourism accounts for 12% of GDP). Angkor Wat shapes Cambodian self-understanding as heir to great civilization. The temple's preservation represents international cooperation and post-conflict recovery after Khmer Rouge genocide. UNESCO designation and restoration efforts position Cambodia in global heritage community."
