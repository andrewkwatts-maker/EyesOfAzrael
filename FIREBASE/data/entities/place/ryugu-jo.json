  "fullDescription": "Ryugu-jo (龍宮城, 'Dragon Palace Castle'), also called Ryugu or Watatsumi no Miya, is the magnificent underwater palace of Ryujin (or Watatsumi), the dragon god of the sea. According to Japanese folktales, particularly the story of Urashima Taro, the palace exists in a timeless realm beneath the ocean where a single day may equal hundreds of years on earth. The palace is described as being made of red and white coral, with gates guarded by dragon servants and halls filled with treasures from across the seas. The four seasons exist simultaneously in different parts of the palace grounds. Princess Otohime, daughter of Ryujin, serves as the palace's hostess. The palace appears in various myths and folktales as a place of supernatural beauty, otherworldly time, and both blessing and danger. Those who visit often receive magical gifts but return to find centuries have passed. The palace represents the mysterious depths of the ocean and the otherworldly nature of the kami realm.",

      "usage": "Ryugu-jo represents the otherworldly realm of the sea kami, a place where normal rules of time and reality don't apply. The palace appears in multiple folktales as a reward for kindness (usually to sea creatures) but also as a cautionary tale about the danger of the otherworld. Visitors receive treasures and hospitality but often lose their earthly lives to the passage of time. The palace embodies the ocean's beauty, mystery, and danger.",
      "names": [

        "Ryugu (龍宮) - Dragon Palace",
        "Watatsumi no Miya (海神宮) - Palace of the Sea God",
        "Ryugu no Shiro (龍宮の城) - Castle of the Dragon Palace"
      ],
      "symbolism": "Ryugu-jo represents the otherworld, the unconscious, and the mystery of the ocean depths. The palace symbolizes timelessness, beauty beyond mortal understanding, and the danger of becoming lost in the otherworld. The simultaneous seasons represent the transcendence of normal time. The coral and treasures symbolize the ocean's wealth. The palace represents both reward for virtue (hospitality for rescuing animals) and the price of otherworldly experience (losing one's place in time).",
      "culturalSignificance": "The Urashima Taro tale is one of Japan's most famous folktales, taught to children and adapted countless times in literature, theater, and popular culture. The palace influenced Japanese aesthetics of underwater beauty and fantasy architecture. The story warns against the temptation to escape into fantasy at the cost of real life. Ryugu-jo appears in modern anime, manga, and video games as an archetypal mystical underwater realm."
