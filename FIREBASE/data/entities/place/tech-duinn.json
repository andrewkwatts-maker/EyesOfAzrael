Located on a rocky island off the southwestern coast of Ireland (identified with Bull Rock or Tech Duinn island), it serves as the assembly point where the souls of the dead gather before departing for the otherworld. Unlike paradisial otherworld realms, Tech Duinn has a darker, more somber character, representing death's threshold and the transition between worlds.",
