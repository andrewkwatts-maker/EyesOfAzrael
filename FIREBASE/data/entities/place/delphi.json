  "fullDescription": "Delphi was ancient Greece's most important oracle site, sacred to Apollo and considered the omphalos (navel) of the world. Located on the slopes of Mount Parnassus, Delphi housed the Temple of Apollo where the Pythia—Apollo's priestess—delivered cryptic prophecies while in divine trance. According to myth, Apollo established the oracle after slaying the serpent Python who guarded the site. The sanctuary became a pan-Hellenic religious center where city-states consulted the oracle before major decisions regarding war, colonization, or legislation. The site featured the famous maxims 'Know Thyself' and 'Nothing in Excess' inscribed on Apollo's temple. Delphi also hosted the Pythian Games, second only to the Olympics in prestige, celebrating Apollo with athletic and musical competitions.",

      "symbolism": "Delphi symbolizes the intersection of divine and mortal realms—where human questions receive divine answers. As the omphalos (navel), it represents the world's spiritual center, the point of cosmic connection. The oracle's cryptic prophecies symbolize divine truth that requires human interpretation and wisdom—gods provide guidance but mortals must understand. Apollo's victory over Python represents order overcoming chaos, light conquering darkness, and civilization taming primal forces. The maxims 'Know Thyself' and 'Nothing in Excess' embody Greek philosophical ideals of self-awareness and moderation. Delphi represents humanity's eternal quest to glimpse the future and understand divine will.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Delphi was the religious and spiritual heart of ancient Greece, transcending city-state rivalries. The Delphic Amphictyony (league of neighboring states) protected the sanctuary, creating one of the earliest forms of international cooperation. Oracular pronouncements influenced major historical decisions—wars, colonization, constitutional changes. 'Delphic' entered language meaning ambiguous or obscure, referencing the oracle's cryptic style. The site influenced Western concepts of prophecy, divine communication, and sacred geography. UNESCO designated Delphi a World Heritage Site. Modern excavations revealed spectacular ruins attracting millions of visitors, keeping ancient spiritual traditions alive."
