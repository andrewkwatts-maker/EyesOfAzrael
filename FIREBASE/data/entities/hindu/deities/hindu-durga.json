  "shortDescription": "The Invincible Mother, Slayer of Mahishasura",
  "longDescription": "Durga was created when the gods could not defeat the buffalo demon Mahishasura , who had received a boon that no man or god could kill him. The gods combined their powers, each contributing their divine weapons and attributes , to create the supreme goddess. Born fully formed, radiant as a thousand suns, riding a lion gifted by the Himalayas, Durga battled Mahishasura for nine days and nights before finally slaying him on the tenth day, celebrated as Vijayadashami (Victory on the Tenth).\n\nMahishasura, the shape-shifting buffalo demon, had conquered the three worlds and driven the gods from heaven. The gods approached the Trimurti - Brahma , Vishnu , and Shiva , who emanated their divine energies in anger. From the combined tejas (brilliant energy) of all the gods emerged Durga , the most beautiful and fierce warrior goddess.\n\nEach god contributed to her power: Shiva gave his trident, Vishnu his discus, Varuna his conch shell, Agni his flaming dart, Vayu his bow, Surya his quiver of arrows, Indra his thunderbolt and a bell, Yama his staff, Vishwakarma his axe and armor, and the Himalayas gave her a lion to ride. Thus armed with the powers of the entire divine pantheon, Durga rode forth to face Mahishasura.\n\nThe battle raged across the cosmos. Mahishasura kept transforming—from buffalo to lion to human form—but Durga matched him at every turn. Finally, as the demon took buffalo form again, Durga pressed her foot upon his neck, pierced him with her trident, and beheaded him with her sword, liberating the universe from his tyranny.\n\nDuring the nine nights of Navaratri, each night is dedicated to one of Durga 's nine forms:\n\nExplore references to Durga , Devi, and Shakti across Hindu sacred texts\n\nRed hibiscus flowers, red clothing, sweets (especially kheer and halwa ), fruits, incense. The Durga Saptashati (700 verses to Durga ) is recited. Sandhi Puja performed at the junction between eighth and ninth day. Kumari Puja - worship of young girls as embodiments of the goddess. Non-vegetarian offerings (especially in Bengal) as a warrior goddess.\n\n\"Om Dum Durgayei Namaha\" - Primary Durga mantra. Durga Gayatri: \"Om Katyayanyai Vidmahe, Kanyakumari Dhimahi, Tanno Durgi Prachodayat\" (I meditate on Katyayani, I contemplate the virgin goddess, may that Durga illuminate my understanding).",
