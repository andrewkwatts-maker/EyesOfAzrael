  "longDescription": "Hanuman is central to the Ramayana epic and has become one of Hinduism's most worshipped deities. Unlike most gods who are worshipped for granting boons, Hanuman is revered for his character - his absolute devotion, his humility despite possessing godlike powers, his courage in the face of any danger, and his selfless service. He represents the ideal devotee who has no ego, no personal desires, existing only to serve his beloved lord. His worship transcends sectarian boundaries - both Vaishnavas and Shaivas revere him, and he is invoked by people of all backgrounds for strength, courage, and protection.\n\nHanuman embodies ideal qualities that make him universally beloved:\n\nHis love for Rama is completely selfless. He wants nothing for himself, only to serve. This is bhakti yoga in its purest form - the path of devotion where the devotee's ego dissolves in love for the divine.\n\nDespite possessing the strength to move mountains and leap oceans, Hanuman remains humble, never boastful. He uses his powers only when needed for service, never for personal glory. True strength, his example teaches, is combined with humility.\n\nAs a lifelong celibate (Brahmachari), Hanuman channeled all his energy into devotion and service. His celibacy wasn't mere abstinence but complete dedication - his love for Rama left no room for any other attachment.\n\nHanuman is not just strong but wise. He knows Sanskrit, composes poetry, and solves problems through cleverness as much as might. His wisdom lies in knowing that all his powers come from grace, not from himself.\n\nHe is invoked for protection from evil spirits, negative energies, and dangers. His very name is believed to dispel fear and difficulties. Homes display his image to ward off malevolent forces.\n\nHanuman temples are found throughout India, often located on hilltops or at village entrances as guardians. Unlike many deities worshipped on specific days, Hanuman is traditionally worshipped on Tuesdays and Saturdays . Wrestlers, athletes, and martial artists especially revere him for strength and discipline. Students worship him for wisdom and concentration.\n\nMajor Hanuman temples include: Sankat Mochan Temple (Varanasi), Hanuman Temple (Connaught Place, Delhi - where worship continues 24 hours), Hanuman Garhi (Ayodhya), Balaji Temple (Mehandipur - famous for spirit exorcism), and countless local temples. Naturally occurring Hanuman images on mountains and rocks are considered especially powerful.\n\nRed flowers (especially hibiscus), red cloth, Sindoor (vermillion - devotees smear it on his image and themselves for his blessings), Ladoos (sweet balls), Bananas , Besan ladoo (chickpea flour sweets), coconut, and sesame oil. Physical exercise, wrestling, and martial arts practice are also considered forms of worship, as is reading the Ramayana.\n\nThe Hanuman Chalisa (40 verses composed by Tulsidas in the 16th century) is the most popular prayer, recited daily by millions. The Bajrang Baan is a powerful hymn for protection. The Sundara Kanda (beautiful chapter) from the Ramayana describing Hanuman's exploits in Lanka is considered especially auspicious. The mantra \"Om Han Hanumate Namah\" and \"Jai Bajrang Bali\" are commonly chanted.\n\nExplore references to Hanuman , Anjaneya, and Maruti across Hindu sacred texts\n\nHanuman embodies the universal archetype of the Divine Servant/Devoted Hero - the faithful companion whose strength and courage are magnified by selfless devotion.\n\nThe archetypal devoted servant whose loyalty, strength, and courage are legendary - embodying pure bhakti\n\nShares the monkey trickster archetype's cleverness, shape-shifting abilities, and boundary-crossing nature",
