  "shortDescription": "Earliest Kabbalistic text (2nd-6th century CE), breviary of cosmic creation teaching that God created the universe through 22 Hebrew letters and 10 sefirot, with practical applications in letter permutation, meditation, and Golem creation",
  "fullDescription": "Sefer Yetzirah (Hebrew: ספר יצירה, 'Book of Formation' or 'Book of Creation') is the foundational text of Jewish mysticism and Kabbalah, a brief but enormously influential work of approximately 1,300 words (varying by version) traditionally attributed to the patriarch Abraham but likely composed between the 2nd-6th centuries CE. This cryptic text presents a sophisticated cosmological and linguistic theory: God created the universe through combinations and permutations of the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet and the 10 sefirot (primordial numbers/emanations). The letters are divided into three 'mothers' (Aleph, Mem, Shin representing air, water, fire), seven 'doubles' (representing the planets and days of the week), and twelve 'simples' (representing the zodiac and months). Through 231 Gates (all possible two-letter combinations), these letters form the building blocks of reality, with each letter corresponding to elements, planets, body parts, seasons, and qualities. The sefirot represent the ten primordial numbers through which God structured creation, later developed into the elaborate Tree of Life system. Sefer Yetzirah teaches that understanding these cosmic letters and numbers enables the adept to participate in divine creativity. The text became central to Jewish mystical practice, spawning hundreds of commentaries (including those by Saadia Gaon, Judah Halevi, Abraham Abulafia, and Isaac the Blind). Medieval traditions claimed that meditating on letter combinations enabled creating a Golem (artificial anthropoid). The text profoundly influenced Christian Kabbalah (Pico, Reuchlin, Knorr von Rosenroth) and Hermetic magic, embedding Hebrew letter mysticism into Western esotericism.",
