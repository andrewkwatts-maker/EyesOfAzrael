  "shortDescription": "Death magic tradition focused on communication with spirits of the dead, divination through corpses, and mediation between the living and deceased realms, ranging from ancient Greek nekyia to medieval grimoire necromancy",
  "fullDescription": "Necromancy (from Greek nekros 'dead' and manteia 'divination') is the magical tradition of communication with the spirits of the dead for purposes of divination, knowledge acquisition, or spirit commanding. Though popularly associated with raising corpses, historical necromancy primarily involved spirit communication, consultation with the dead for hidden knowledge, and psychopomp work mediating between worlds. Ancient Greek nekromanteia included ritual journeys to the underworld (as in Homer's Odyssey Book 11) and consultation with shades at necromantic oracles. Medieval European necromancy, preserved in grimoires like the Munich Handbook, developed elaborate ceremonial techniques involving circles, conjurations, and timing based on planetary hours. Across cultures, necromancy rests on the philosophical premise that death is not absolute annihilation but transformation—the dead retain knowledge, consciousness, and the ability to communicate with properly prepared practitioners. Modern necromantic practice emphasizes ethical ancestor work, psychopomp service guiding the dead, and spirit communication rather than coercive commanding or corpse manipulation.",

    "origins": "Necromancy appears in ancient civilizations worldwide. Greek nekromanteia (divination by the dead) is documented from Homeric times, with oracles of the dead at sites like Acheron. Ancient Mesopotamian, Egyptian, and other cultures practiced forms of ancestor communication and spirit consultation.",
    "classicalPeriod": "Homer's Odyssey Book 11 (c. 8th century BCE) depicts Odysseus' nekyia—ritual journey to Hades to consult the prophet Tiresias. Greek magical papyri contain necromantic spells. Romans consulted deceased spirits at specific locations and times.",
    "medievalDevelopment": "Medieval European necromancy flourished despite Church condemnation, preserved in grimoires like the Munich Handbook (15th century). This ceremonial necromancy involved elaborate rituals, circles, divine names, and timing by planetary hours to compel deceased spirits to appear and answer questions.",
    "earlyModern": "Renaissance magic distinguished necromancy (communication with dead) from goetia (demon evocation), though the terms often blurred. Necromancy was considered the darkest art due to Church association with demonic commerce.",
    "modernRevival": "Contemporary necromancy emphasizes ethical practice: ancestor veneration, psychopomp work helping spirits transition, and respectful spirit communication. Influenced by spiritism, modern witchcraft, and reconstructed practices, it distances itself from corpse desecration and coercive methods."

  "effects": "Successful necromantic practice enables communication with deceased spirits for knowledge, guidance, or closure. Practitioners may receive information about past events, hidden matters, or personal guidance from ancestors. Psychopomp work helps earthbound spirits find peace and transition properly. The practice develops mediumistic abilities, strengthens boundaries between worlds, and deepens understanding of death and afterlife cosmology. Benefits include ancestral healing, recovery of lost knowledge, and service to both living and dead.",
  "warnings": "Necromancy carries significant psychological and spiritual risks. Practitioners must maintain strong energetic boundaries to avoid attachment by confused or malevolent spirits. The practice can attract unwanted entities if protection is insufficient. Psychological dangers include obsession with death, depression, or destabilization from contact with the deceased. Cultural appropriation concerns: respect cultural death taboos and practices. Never practice in intoxicated, emotionally unstable, or mentally unwell states. Avoid graveyards without permission and respect the dead. Modern ethical practice rejects corpse desecration, coercion of spirits, or harmful magic using the dead. Ensure thorough banishing and grounding after all workings. Those with trauma around death should approach cautiously or avoid entirely.",
