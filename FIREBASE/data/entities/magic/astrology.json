  "fullDescription": "Astrology is the study of the relationship between celestial phenomena and terrestrial events, based on the principle that the positions and movements of celestial bodies at specific moments correlate with character traits, life events, and worldly affairs. Emerging independently in multiple ancient civilizations, astrology represents humanity's earliest attempt to systematize observations of cosmic patterns and their apparent influence on earthly existence. While modern science distinguishes astronomy (empirical study of celestial objects) from astrology (interpretive correlation), the two were historically unified as a single discipline seeking to understand both the mechanics and meaning of celestial movements. The philosophical foundation rests on the Hermetic axiom 'As above, so below'—the principle of correspondence stating that patterns in the macrocosm (universe) reflect in the microcosm (individual).",

  "effects": "Astrology provides insight into personality patterns, psychological tendencies, life challenges, and potential timing for events. Practitioners gain understanding of their strengths, weaknesses, and life purpose. Predictive techniques can indicate favorable and challenging periods, though interpretations emphasize potential and probability rather than fixed fate. Modern psychological astrology focuses on self-awareness and personal growth rather than deterministic prediction. The practice develops pattern recognition, symbolic thinking, and awareness of cyclical rhythms in life.",
  "warnings": "Astrology should not replace medical, legal, or financial professional advice. Avoid fatalistic interpretations that remove personal agency and free will. Be wary of overly specific predictions or claims of absolute certainty. Some critics view astrology as pseudoscience lacking empirical validation. Ethical practitioners avoid creating dependency or making clients feel powerless. Birth time inaccuracy significantly affects house placements and Ascendant. Cultural differences exist between tropical and sidereal zodiacs (Western vs. Vedic). Avoid using astrology to manipulate or control others.",
