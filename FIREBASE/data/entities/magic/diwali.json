  "fullDescription": "Diwali (Deepavali, meaning 'row of lights') is one of the most important and widely celebrated festivals in Hinduism, observed over five days during the lunar month of Kartika (October-November). The festival commemorates multiple mythological events—most prominently, Lord Rama's return to Ayodhya after 14 years of exile and his victory over the demon king Ravana; the victory of Lord Krishna over the demon Narakasura; and Lakshmi Puja honoring the goddess of wealth and prosperity. The festival's central practice involves lighting countless oil lamps (diyas), candles, and decorative lights to symbolize the triumph of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. Each of the five days has specific rituals: Dhanteras (wealth worship), Naraka Chaturdashi (cleansing), Lakshmi Puja (main celebration), Govardhan Puja (Krishna worship), and Bhai Dooj (sibling bonds). Families thoroughly clean and decorate homes with rangoli designs, perform elaborate pujas, exchange gifts and sweets, wear new clothes, and participate in fireworks displays. Diwali marks the beginning of the new year in many Hindu traditions and represents spiritual renewal, the victory of dharma, and the hope that light will always overcome darkness.",

The festival strengthens family and community bonds, marks new beginnings, and reaffirms the triumph of dharma (righteousness). Lighting diyas dispels darkness from homes and hearts, symbolizing the victory of knowledge over ignorance. Participants experience joy, hope, and renewed commitment to righteous living. The festival also brings practical benefits through home cleaning, financial planning (new account books), and social connection.",
  "warnings": "Diwali fireworks can cause injuries, fires, and air pollution—increasingly controversial in modern times. Excessive gambling (traditionally permitted during Diwali) can lead to financial problems. The festival's commercialization raises concerns about materialism overshadowing spiritual meaning. Environmental concerns about firecracker waste and noise pollution have led to calls for 'green Diwali' celebrations.",

Cleaning represents purification of body, mind, and spirit. New clothes symbolize renewal and fresh beginnings. The festival embodies Hindu belief that light/knowledge will ultimately triumph over darkness/ignorance.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Diwali is celebrated by over a billion people worldwide, making it one of the world's most widely observed festivals. It transcends Hindu communities, celebrated also by Jains (marking Mahavira's nirvana), Sikhs (release of Guru Hargobind), and some Buddhists. The festival has become a national holiday in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Mauritius, Guyana, Trinidad, Fiji, and Singapore. Diwali shapes Indian cultural identity, drives enormous economic activity, and has gained global recognition with celebrations from the White House to the British Parliament to the Sydney Opera House."
