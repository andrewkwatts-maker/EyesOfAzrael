Her sacred grove at Aricia near Rome was one of the most important cult sites in Italy.\n\nDomains: Hunt, moon, wilderness, virginity, childbirth, animals, archery\n\nSymbols: Bow and arrows, crescent moon, hunting dogs, deer\n\nSacred Animals: Deer (especially does), hounds, bear\n\nSacred Plants: Cypress, willow, oak\n\nThe sacred grove at Lake Nemi near Rome was Diana 's most important shrine. Here the Rex Nemorensis (\"King of the Wood\") served as her priest, but could only become priest by killing his predecessor in ritual combat—reflecting the savage, wild nature of Diana 's domain. The site attracted pilgrims from throughout Italy seeking Diana 's protection.\n\nDiana manifested in three forms corresponding to moon phases and realms:",
