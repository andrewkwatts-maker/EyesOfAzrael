  "longDescription": "Goddess of the Hearth , Home & Sacred Fire\n\nVesta is the Roman goddess of the hearth and domestic fire, embodying home, family, and the sacred flame that symbolized Rome's eternal existence. Her sacred fire , tended by the Vestal Virgins, burned perpetually in the Forum Romanum. Unlike other deities represented by statues, Vesta manifested as the fire itself—pure, consuming, life-giving force at the heart of every Roman home and the state.\n\nDomains: Hearth, domestic fire, home, family, state protection, purity\n\nSymbols: Sacred flame, hearth, simple dwelling, veiled head\n\nSacred Objects: Palladium (image of Pallas Athena brought from Troy)\n\nSix priestesses served Vesta , maintaining the sacred fire that protected Rome. Selected between ages 6-10 from noble families, they served 30 years under strict vows:\n\nVestals enjoyed extraordinary privileges: front seats at games, could pardon condemned criminals they met by chance, owned property, made wills, and were escorted by lictors. Their persons were sacred —harming a Vestal was punishable by death.\n\nFestival honoring Vesta when her circular temple in the Forum was opened to Roman matrons (normally forbidden entry). Women brought offerings and prayed for household prosperity. On June 15, the temple was ritually swept and cleansed, with refuse thrown into the Tiber. Bakers and millers offered to Vesta as goddess of the hearth where bread was baked.",
