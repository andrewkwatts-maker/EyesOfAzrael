  "name": "Juno\n     \n     Regina",
  "icon": "👑",
  "title": "Roman - Juno",
  "subtitle": "Queen of Gods, Marriage, Childbirth & State Protection",
  "shortDescription": "Juno is the queen of the Roman pantheon, divine consort of Jupiter , and protector of women, marriage, and the Roman state. As Juno Regina (\"Queen\"), she holds supreme authority alongside Jupiter and Minerva in the Capitoline Triad , embodying both feminine power and state sovereignty.",
  "longDescription": "Juno 's mythology reflects her dual nature as both Jupiter 's wife (suffering from his infidelities) and as a sovereign deity in her own right, independent of her husband's authority . The Romans emphasized her protective role over the Greek focus on jealousy.\n\nTemple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline Hill housed Juno 's cult alongside Jupiter and Minerva . The Temple of Juno Moneta , also on the Capitoline, served as Rome's mint and treasury. Temple of Juno Regina on the Aventine Hill (dedicated 392 BCE after capture from Veii) marked her adoption as protector of Rome. Her sanctuaries existed throughout the empire, particularly in cities with strong matriarchal traditions.\n\nJuno received offerings of white cows (especially from married women seeking fertility), lilies, pomegranates, cakes, wine, and incense. Pregnant women offered toys and small clothes to Juno Lucina, praying for safe delivery. Brides sacrificed to Juno before marriage, seeking her blessing on the union. The Flaminica Dialis (wife of Jupiter 's high priest) conducted special rites in Juno 's honor, wearing distinctive dress and observing ritual purity requirements nearly as strict as her husband's.\n\nTraditional invocation: \" Juno Regina, Queen of Heaven , protector of women and guardian of Rome —we seek your blessing. As you watch over marriage and guide women through childbirth, grant us your divine protection. May your sacred geese warn us of danger, may your wisdom as Moneta guide our decisions, and may your power as Sospita save us from harm. By your crown and scepter, we pray.\"\n\nBride's prayer: \" Juno Lucina, bring light to this union. As you joined with Jupiter in sacred marriage, bless this bond. Grant fertility, harmony, and lasting devotion .\"\n\nUnlike Greek Hera 's relatively focused role, Juno manifested in numerous forms reflecting different aspects of female and state power:\n\nWhile directly equivalent to Greek Hera , Juno held a more powerful and respected position in Roman religion:\n\nThis deity embodies the following universal archetypes found across world mythologies:\n\nDivine queen, marriage protector\n\nGuardian of Rome , divine warrior",
