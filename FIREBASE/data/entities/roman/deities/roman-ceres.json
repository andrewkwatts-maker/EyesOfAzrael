  "longDescription": "Goddess of Agriculture, Grain & Fertility\n\nCeres is the Roman goddess of agriculture, grain cultivation, and fertility. Mother of Proserpina , her grief when her daughter descends to the underworld causes winter; her joy at reunion brings spring and harvest. As protector of the plebeians, her temple on the Aventine Hill served as headquarters for common people's political activities. The word \"cereal\" derives from her name.\n\nDomains: Agriculture, grain (especially wheat), cultivation, harvest, fertility, motherhood\n\nSymbols: Wheat sheaves, cornucopia, torch (searching for Proserpina ), crown of grain\n\nSacred Animals: Pig (sacrificed to her), snake\n\nSacred Plants: Wheat, barley, poppy\n\nCeres 's daughter Proserpina was abducted by Pluto while gathering flowers. Ceres searched earth with torches, neglecting crops. Famine spread until Jupiter negotiated: Proserpina would spend half the year in the underworld (autumn/winter) and half with Ceres (spring/summer). This explains agricultural seasons—when Proserpina returns, Ceres restores fertility; when she departs, Ceres withdraws her blessings and winter comes.\n\nFestival honoring Ceres with games, offerings of grain, and agricultural rites. Foxes with burning torches tied to their tails were released in the Circus Maximus (commemorating farmers punishing a fox that raided grain stores). Prayers for successful planting and bountiful harvest.\n\nLocated on the Aventine Hill (dedicated 493 BCE), this temple housed not only Ceres but also Liber (wine/freedom) and Libera (identified with Proserpina ). It served as political headquarters for plebeians, storing grain reserves for distribution to the poor and housing plebeian assembly records.",
