  "subtitle": "Quetzalcoatl\n     \n     - \"Feathered Serpent\" / \"Precious Twin\"",
  "shortDescription": "The Feathered Serpent is one of the most important deities of ancient Mesoamerica. As god of wind, learning, and creation, Quetzalcoatl brought civilization to humanity - the calendar, writing, agriculture, and the arts. He represents the union of earth (serpent) and sky (quetzal bird), the boundary between the material and spiritual realms.",
  "longDescription": "After the destruction of the Fourth Sun, Quetzalcoatl journeyed to Mictlan , the underworld, to retrieve the bones of previous humans. He succeeded in stealing them from the death god Mictlantecuhtli, though he fell into a pit and shattered the bones into pieces of varying sizes (explaining why humans come in different heights). He brought the bone fragments to the paradise of Tamoanchan, where the goddess Cihuacoatl ground them into powder. The gods then mixed the powder with their own blood, creating the humans of the Fifth Sun.\n\nQuetzalcoatl discovered that ants were carrying corn kernels from inside a mountain. Transforming himself into a black ant, he followed them into Tonacatepetl (Mountain of Sustenance) and carried out maize to give to humanity. He then convinced the rain gods, the Tlaloque , to split open the mountain so all foods could be released for human cultivation. This gift of agriculture transformed humans from wandering hunters into a civilized people.\n\nIn the darkness after the Fourth Sun's destruction, the gods gathered at Teotihuacan to create a new sun. Two gods volunteered to become the new sun by throwing themselves into a divine fire. After the sacrifice, the new sun hung motionless in the sky. Only when all the gods sacrificed themselves did the sun begin its daily journey. This myth explains why humans must offer blood in return - the gods gave everything, so humanity must repay the debt.\n\nThe most dramatic myth involves the priest-king Ce Acatl Topiltzin Quetzalcoatl of Tollan (Tula). His rival Tezcatlipoca, jealous of his virtue and opposed to human sacrifice, tricked him into drinking pulque (alcohol) and committing incest with his sister. Overcome with shame, Quetzalcoatl abdicated his throne and journeyed east to the Gulf Coast.\n\nThere, according to various accounts, he either immolated himself on a funeral pyre (his heart rising to become Venus, the morning star) or sailed away on a raft of serpents, promising to return in a year \"One Reed\" ( Ce Acatl ). This prophecy gained significance when Hernan Cortes arrived in 1519, a One Reed year, leading some (controversially) to suggest Moctezuma believed him to be the returning god.\n\nUnlike most Aztec deities, Quetzalcoatl was traditionally associated with opposition to human sacrifice. As the culture hero who refused blood offerings and promoted self-sacrifice through bloodletting, he represents an alternative spiritual path. However, his temples still received offerings, and as Ehecatl (Wind), round temples were built to him so wind could flow freely.\n\nQuetzalcoatl remains one of the most recognized deities of pre-Columbian America. His image as the feathered serpent is found throughout Mesoamerican art from Teotihuacan to the Maya regions. The myth of his return has been the subject of much scholarly debate, particularly regarding the Spanish conquest.\n\nIn modern Mexico, Quetzalcoatl is celebrated as a symbol of pre-Hispanic heritage and indigenous wisdom. His association with learning, arts, and opposition to human sacrifice makes him an appealing figure for contemporary interpretations of Aztec spirituality. New Age movements have also adopted him as a symbol of transformation and cosmic consciousness.",
