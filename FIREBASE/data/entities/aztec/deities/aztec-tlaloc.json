  "subtitle": "Tlaloc\n     \n     - \"He Who Makes Things Sprout\" / \"Earth\"",
  "shortDescription": "Among the oldest and most revered deities of Mesoamerica, Tlaloc was the god of rain, fertility, and water. Predating the Aztecs by millennia, his goggle-eyed visage appears in the ruins of Teotihuacan. He brought the life-giving rains that made agriculture possible, but also the devastating floods, hail, and lightning that could destroy crops and lives. His paradise, Tlalocan, awaited those who died by water or lightning.",
  "longDescription": "In the Aztec creation cycle, Tlaloc presided over the Third Sun (Third World Age) called Nahui Quiahuitl (\"Four Rain\"). During this age, the world was destroyed by a rain of fire - some say volcanic eruptions, others a rain of burning stones from the sky. The survivors were transformed into turkeys, dogs, and butterflies.\n\nTlaloc rules over Tlalocan , one of the Aztec afterlife realms. Unlike the bleak underworld of Mictlan, Tlalocan is described as a verdant paradise of eternal spring, abundant with food, flowers, and gentle rains. Those who die by drowning, lightning strike, water-related diseases (like dropsy), or leprosy are taken directly to this paradise rather than journeying to Mictlan.\n\nTlaloc commands the Tlaloque (also called Tepictoton ), a host of smaller rain deities associated with mountains, clouds, and bodies of water. Each mountain had its own tlaloque, which stored rain in great jars. When Tlaloc commanded, they would break their jars with their lightning staffs, releasing rain. The type of rain depended on which jar was broken - some brought gentle, nourishing rain; others brought hail, frost, or floods.\n\nTlaloc is among the most ancient deities of Mesoamerica, his worship predating the Aztecs by over a thousand years. His distinctive goggle-eyed, fanged face appears in the murals and sculptures of Teotihuacan (circa 100 CE - 750 CE), the great city that influenced all later Mesoamerican cultures.\n\nWhen the Aztecs rose to power, they inherited this ancient rain god and elevated him to supreme importance. He shared the great Templo Mayor with Huitzilopochtli - representing the two pillars of Aztec civilization: agriculture and war. While Huitzilopochtli represented the conquering Mexica nation, Tlaloc represented the ancient land itself and the agricultural cycles that fed the empire.\n\nTlaloc's cult required some of the most emotionally difficult sacrifices in Aztec religion. Because he controlled the waters essential for agriculture, appeasing him was crucial for survival.\n\nThe Aztecs believed that the tears of children would call forth Tlaloc's rain. During droughts or at specific festival times, children (especially those with distinctive features like birthmarks or double cowlicks) were sacrificed to Tlaloc. They were often decorated with jade, blue flowers, and feathers before being led to mountain shrines or drowned in Lake Texcoco. The more the children cried, the more effective the sacrifice was believed to be.\n\nThe first month of the Aztec calendar was dedicated to Tlaloc and the water deities. During Atlcahualo (\"Stopping of Water\"), children were sacrificed at seven different locations around the Valley of Mexico, particularly at mountain shrines where clouds gathered.\n\nTlaloc remains one of the most recognizable figures of pre-Columbian Mexican art. His goggle-eyed visage appears on countless ancient artifacts and continues to influence Mexican art and identity. A massive stone sculpture of Tlaloc, weighing 168 tons, was controversially moved from the town of Coatlinchan to Mexico City in 1964, where it now stands outside the National Museum of Anthropology.\n\nLocal legend claims that on the day the statue was moved, a massive rainstorm struck Mexico City despite it being the dry season - as if Tlaloc was expressing his displeasure. This story reflects the ongoing cultural connection between modern Mexicans and their ancient religious heritage.\n\nIn indigenous communities that maintain traditional practices, offerings to rain and mountain spirits continue, representing an unbroken thread connecting contemporary Mexico to its Mesoamerican past.",
