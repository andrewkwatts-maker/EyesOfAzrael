  "shortDescription": "Shamash is the Babylonian sun god, divine judge , and upholder of cosmic justice. His all-seeing rays penetrate darkness, revealing truth and punishing wickedness. As he traverses the heavens each day, nothing escapes his gaze. He is the patron of law , justice , and divination , granting wisdom to kings and common people alike.",
  "longDescription": "Shamash embodies the principle that sunlight reveals all truth. As the sun traverses the sky, his rays penetrate every hidden place, making him the perfect divine judge. He sees all human actions and knows every secret, making oaths sworn in his name binding and terrible to break.\n\nShamash appears in ancient Babylonian /Akkadian cuneiform texts. Search the ORACC corpus to explore original texts in transliteration and translation.\n\nMajor texts include: Epic of Gilgamesh , Code of Hammurabi , solar hymns\n\nShamash 's primary temple was the Ebabbar (\"Shining House\") in Sippar, one of the oldest continuously worshipped sites in Mesopotamia. A second major temple, also called Ebabbar, stood in Larsa. These temples faced east to greet the rising sun. Temple courtyards contained sundials and astronomical observation platforms where priests tracked solar movements for calendar keeping and divination .\n\nDaily offerings of white bread, milk, and honey at sunrise. Golden vessels and solar disk imagery adorned his altars. Those seeking justice brought offerings asking Shamash to illuminate truth in legal disputes. Diviners offered incense and performed hepatoscopy (reading sheep livers) to receive Shamash 's prophetic guidance.\n\nTypical invocations addressed Shamash as \" Judge of heaven and earth \" and \"Light of the gods.\" Legal oaths began: \"By Shamash and Marduk , I swear...\" Breaking such an oath invited divine punishment. Morning prayers asked for his protection and guidance throughout the day. Evening prayers thanked him for his watchful care and asked for just dreams revealing truth.",
