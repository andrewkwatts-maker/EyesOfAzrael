  "title": "Babylonian - Ishtar",
  "subtitle": "Queen of Heaven\n     \n     , Lady of Battles",
  "shortDescription": "Goddess of love, sexuality, fertility, and war. The evening and morning star (Venus), Ishtar embodies passionate extremes - nurturing love and devastating violence. Most complex and powerful of the goddesses, she defies categorization, moving freely between traditional gender roles and divine hierarchies.",
  "longDescription": "Ishtar inherited characteristics from the Sumerian goddess Inanna , becoming the most prominent female deity in the Babylonian pantheon. Her myths emphasize her independence, fierce sexuality, and refusal to submit to male authority.\n\nIshtar appears in ancient Babylonian /Akkadian cuneiform texts. Search the ORACC corpus to explore original texts in transliteration and translation.\n\nMajor texts include: Descent of Ishtar , Epic of Gilgamesh , hymns and prayers to Ishtar\n\nIshtar 's primary cult center was Uruk, where the massive temple Eanna (\"House of Heaven\") served as her dwelling. Her worship was also prominent in Babylon, Nineveh, and Arbela. The Ishtar Gate of Babylon, decorated with her sacred bulls and dragons in brilliant blue glazed brick, stood as one of the ancient world's wonders. Sacred prostitution may have been practiced at her temples, with sexual acts serving as worship to the goddess of sexuality.\n\nOfferings to Ishtar included incense (especially cedar and juniper), wine, honey cakes, roses and myrtle, and animals (doves, sheep). Warriors offered her captured weapons and armor after victory. Personal offerings often related to love and sexuality - prayers for successful unions, fertility, or reconciliation. Her priestesses received offerings in exchange for temple services including divination and sacred sexuality.\n\nIshtar was invoked for matters of love, war, and political power. Lovers sought her blessing for passion and fertility. Warriors called upon her before battle for ferocity and victory. Kings invoked her as legitimizer of their rule. Typical invocation: \"O Ishtar , foremost among goddesses, brilliant one who rises in the heavens, torch of heaven and earth, grant me your favor!\" Her dual nature meant she could grant both blessing and curse with equal intensity.\n\nIshtar 's cult included individuals who transcended traditional gender categories. The assinnu , kurgarrû , and kulu'u were devotees who took on non-binary gender roles, sometimes castrated, who performed ecstatic dances and sang in Ishtar 's honor. Ancient texts describe how Ishtar \"turns men into women and women into men,\" suggesting her power over gender and sexuality extended beyond conventional boundaries. This made her both patron of heterosexual love and sacred protector of those who existed outside binary gender norms.",
