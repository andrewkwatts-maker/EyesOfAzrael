  "shortDescription": "Patron deity of scribes, scholars, and wisdom. Keeper of the Tablet of Destinies , recorder of divine decrees , and son of Marduk . Nabu embodies knowledge, prophecy, and the power of the written word to shape reality and preserve truth across time.",
  "longDescription": "Nabu 's prominence grew throughout the first millennium BCE, eventually rivaling his father Marduk in some periods. His cult emphasized literacy, learning, and the preservation of knowledge as sacred acts.\n\nNabu 's primary temple was the Ezida (\"True House\") at Borsippa, near Babylon. The temple complex included a major ziggurat and extensive libraries where cuneiform tablets were copied, studied, and preserved. He also had temples in Nineveh, Nimrud, and throughout Mesopotamia. These temples functioned as scribal schools where young men learned the complex art of cuneiform writing under Nabu 's patronage. Every temple library was considered under Nabu 's protection.\n\nOfferings to Nabu included fresh water (for mixing clay), styluses and writing tools, clay tablets inscribed with prayers, grain and dates (connecting writing to agriculture), incense (especially cedar), and the firstfruits of scribal work. Scholars dedicated copied texts to Nabu , with colophons praising the god and requesting his blessing on the work. Kings who commissioned libraries or renovated scribal schools made grand offerings to Nabu .\n\nScribes invoked Nabu daily before beginning work: \"O Nabu , lord of the stylus, open my understanding, guide my hand, grant me precision!\" Students prayed for clarity of mind and retention of lessons. Diviners sought Nabu 's aid in correctly interpreting omens. Typical prayer structure praised Nabu 's wisdom, requested specific assistance, and promised faithful service in return. Many cuneiform tablets end with \"Praise to Nabu !\" as a scribal signature.\n\nTo be a scribe in ancient Mesopotamia was to serve Nabu directly. The profession was hereditary and highly respected, as literacy was rare and powerful. Scribes underwent years of rigorous training in the \"tablet house\" (edubba), learning thousands of cuneiform signs, mathematical calculations, legal formulas, medical texts, and religious hymns. They were essential to administration, commerce, law, religion, and the preservation of culture itself.\n\nRoyal scribes recorded kings' deeds, temple scribes maintained ritual calendars and divination records, merchant scribes tracked trade, and scholarly scribes copied ancient texts . All worked under Nabu 's patronage, and the god's favor was seen as essential to accurate, clear writing. Scribal colophons often invoked curses (through Nabu ) on anyone who would damage or steal tablets.",
