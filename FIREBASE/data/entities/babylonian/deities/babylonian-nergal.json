  "title": "Babylonian - Nergal",
  "subtitle": "Lord of the Underworld - God of War, Plague, and Death",
  "shortDescription": "Nergal is the fierce god of war, plague, fire, and death—the scorching summer sun that brings fever and pestilence. As king of the underworld , he rules alongside his consort Ereshkigal over the land of no return . He embodies destructive power, martial prowess, and the inevitable mortality that claims all living beings. Warriors invoke him for victory, but all fear his wrath in the form of disease and violent death.",
  "longDescription": "Nergal 's mythology centers on his violent nature and his unlikely marriage to Ereshkigal , queen of the dead. He represents the terrifying aspects of divine power—the god who brings plague, devastates cities, and drags souls to the underworld. Yet his myths also show him as a god of necessary destruction, clearing away the old to make room for the new.\n\nNergal 's primary temple was E-meslam (\"House of Meslam\") in Kutha, a city associated with death and the underworld. The temple was feared as a gateway to the realm of the dead. Soldiers and those facing death made pilgrimages to seek Nergal 's favor. The temple complex included areas for apotropaic rituals meant to ward off Nergal 's destructive power during plague seasons.\n\nOfferings to Nergal were often apotropaic—meant to ward off his wrath rather than gain his favor. Red wine (symbolizing blood), meat from black animals, weapons, and military spoils. During plagues, desperate offerings sought to turn away his anger. Warriors dedicated captured enemy weapons to him after victories.\n\nPrayers addressed Nergal with fearful respect: \"O fierce Nergal , turn away your terrible face!\" Warriors invoked him: \"Grant me your strength in battle, let me not fall before my enemies!\" The sick pleaded: \"Remove your hand from me , O lord of fever!\" His worship balanced fear with necessary respect—he was terrible but also powerful, dangerous but potentially protective.",
