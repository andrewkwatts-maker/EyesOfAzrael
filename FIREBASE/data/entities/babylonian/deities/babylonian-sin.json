  "shortDescription": "Sin is the Babylonian moon god, ancient keeper of time, and father of celestial deities. His waxing and waning phases measure the passage of months, regulate festivals, and govern divination . As the luminous boat sailing through night's dark waters, Sin brings wisdom, prophetic dreams, and protection against nocturnal dangers. He is patron of astrology , calendar-keeping , and mystical knowledge.",

His worship centered in the city of Ur, where Abraham was said to have lived before his journey to Canaan. As father of Shamash (sun) and Ishtar (Venus), Sin heads the celestial triad governing the visible heavens.\n\nSin appears in ancient Babylonian /Akkadian cuneiform texts. Search the ORACC corpus to explore original texts in transliteration and translation.\n\nMajor texts include: Lunar hymns, Nabonidus inscriptions , prayers to Sin\n\nSin 's primary temple was the Ekišnugal (\"House of the Great Seed\") in Ur, one of the oldest and most continuously worshipped sites in Mesopotamia. The temple's ziggurat could be seen for miles across the flat plains. A second major temple stood in Harran in upper Mesopotamia, which remained a center of moon worship into late antiquity. These temples contained astronomical observation platforms for tracking lunar phases.\n\nDaily offerings of milk, beer, dates, and bread. Silver vessels (representing moonlight) held offerings. White cattle were especially sacred to Sin , their horns echoing the crescent moon. During new moon festivals, priests offered first fruits of the date harvest. Night-time offerings included burning of sweet-smelling incense and libations poured under moonlight.\n\nPrayers addressed Sin as \"Father Nanna \" and \"Lord of Destiny.\" Typical invocations : \"O Sin , bright moon, renewer of months, enlightener of darkness, reveal the meaning of dreams!\" Calendar priests prayed for clear skies to observe lunar phases. Diviners sought Sin 's guidance in interpreting celestial omens. Women prayed to Sin for fertility, linking his monthly renewal with menstrual cycles.",
