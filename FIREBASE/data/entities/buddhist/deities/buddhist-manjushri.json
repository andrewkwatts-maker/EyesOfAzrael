  "shortDescription": "Manjushri (Sanskrit: \"Gentle Glory\") embodies the prajna (transcendent wisdom) of all Buddhas. He wields the flaming sword of discriminating awareness that cuts through ignorance, delusion, and dualistic thinking, revealing the empty nature of all phenomena. He is the patron of scholars, teachers, and all who seek understanding of ultimate truth.",
  "longDescription": "Manjushri is typically depicted as a youthful prince (kumara) of sixteen years, representing the eternal freshness of wisdom. He sits in the vajrasana (lotus posture) or in lalitasana (royal ease), adorned with the ornaments of a bodhisattva: crown, earrings, necklaces, armlets, and flowing silk garments.\n\nHis right hand holds the flaming sword of discriminating wisdom (prajna khadga) raised high. This is not a weapon of violence but the sharp insight that:\n\nHis left hand holds a stem of an utpala lotus (blue lotus) which supports the Prajnaparamita Sutra (\"Perfection of Wisdom\" text). This represents:\n\nManjushri rides or sits upon a lion, sometimes shown with a white or golden mane. The lion symbolizes:\n\nIn tantric depictions, Manjushri appears with multiple forms:\n\nManjushri embodies prajna, which is not ordinary knowledge or intelligence but transcendent wisdom— the direct, non-conceptual insight into the ultimate nature of reality. This wisdom includes:\n\nManjushri 's two symbols represent the two aspects of prajna:\n\nTogether they embody the Buddhist Middle Way: neither nihilistic denial of all meaning nor eternalistic grasping at inherent existence, but the wisdom that sees emptiness and compassion as inseparable.\n\nOm A Ra Pa Ca Na Dhih (ॐ अ र प च न धीः)\n\nEach syllable represents one of the perfections and purifies obstacles to wisdom:",
