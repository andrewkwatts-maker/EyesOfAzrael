  "longDescription": "Born as Prince Siddhartha Gautama in Lumbini (present-day Nepal) around 563 BCE to King Suddhodana of the Shakya clan and Queen Maya. Seven days after his birth, his mother died, and he was raised by his maternal aunt Mahaprajapati Gotami. The sage Asita prophesied he would become either a great king (chakravartin) or a great spiritual teacher (buddha). His father, desiring him to be a king, surrounded him with luxury and shielded him from all suffering.\n\nAt age 29, despite his father's efforts, Siddhartha ventured beyond the palace walls on four occasions with his charioteer Channa. He encountered:\n\nThese \"Four Sights\" shattered his sheltered worldview and awakened his quest for understanding the nature of suffering and its cessation.\n\nOn the night of his son Rahula's birth, Siddhartha made the painful decision to leave the palace. He cut his long hair with his sword, exchanged his royal garments for simple robes, and sent his horse Kanthaka back with Channa. This \"Great Going Forth\" (Mahābhinishkramana) marked his complete renunciation of worldly life at age 29.\n\nFor six years, Siddhartha studied with renowned teachers including Alara Kalama and Uddaka Ramaputta, mastering advanced meditation states. Finding these insufficient for complete liberation, he turned to extreme asceticism, reducing his food intake to a single grain of rice per day and practicing severe austerities that brought him to the brink of death. Five ascetic companions joined him in these practices.\n\nRealizing that self-mortification was as futile as indulgence, Siddhartha discovered the Middle Way between extremes. He accepted milk-rice from a village woman named Sujata, regaining his strength. His five companions, thinking he had abandoned the path, left him.\n\nAt Bodh Gaya, he sat beneath a pipal tree (later known as the Bodhi Tree) on a grass mat offered by the grass-cutter Sotthiya, vowing: \"Let my skin, sinews, and bones dry up, let my blood dry up, but I will not rise from this seat until I have attained supreme enlightenment.\"\n\nDuring the night of the full moon in May (Vesak), he passed through progressively deeper states of meditation:\n\nBefore dawn, Mara, the demon of delusion, attacked with his armies and tempting daughters, attempting to prevent the awakening. Siddhartha touched the earth (Bhumisparsha mudra), calling the Earth Goddess Prithvi to witness his countless lifetimes of virtue. Mara was defeated.\n\nAt dawn, Siddhartha became the Buddha—\"the Awakened One\"—achieving complete liberation from suffering, ignorance, and the cycle of rebirth . He remained in meditation for 49 days, experiencing the bliss of liberation and contemplating whether to teach this profound truth.\n\nInitially, the Buddha hesitated to teach, thinking the Dharma too subtle for others to comprehend. Brahma Sahampati, lord of the gods, descended to request that he teach for the welfare of beings \"with little dust in their eyes.\" Moved by compassion, the Buddha agreed.\n\nHe traveled to the Deer Park at Sarnath near Varanasi and found his five former companions. To them, he delivered his first sermon, the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta (Setting in Motion the Wheel of Dharma), teaching the Middle Way, the Four Noble Truths, and the Noble Eightfold Path. Kondañña became the first to achieve enlightenment, exclaiming \"I understand!\" All five became arhats and formed the first Sangha (monastic community).\n\nFor 45 years, the Buddha wandered throughout the Gangetic plain teaching all who would listen— kings and beggars, brahmins and outcasts, men and women, monastics and laypeople. Notable events:\n\nAt age 80, the Buddha accepted a meal from the blacksmith Cunda that caused severe food poisoning. Despite intense pain, he insisted Cunda bore no fault—this was simply the natural time for his physical death. He instructed Ananda to tell Cunda his offering was of great merit, as it preceded the Buddha's final liberation.\n\nHe traveled to Kushinagar and lay down between two sal trees in the \"lion's posture\" (lying on his right side). Surrounded by grieving disciples and gods, he gave final instructions:\n\nHe passed through the jhanas (meditative absorptions) in ascending and descending order, finally entering parinirvana—complete extinction of the fires of greed, hatred, and delusion. The earth shook, and the gods wept.\n\nHis body was cremated with royal honors. His relics were divided into eight portions and enshrined in stupas throughout India, becoming objects of veneration and pilgrimage.\n\nThe foundation of all Buddhist teaching, realized during the Buddha's enlightenment:\n\nThe Buddha's profound insight into causality, showing how suffering arises and ceases through a chain of 12 links.
