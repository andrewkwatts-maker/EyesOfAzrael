  "subtitle": "The Lord Who Looks Down with Compassion",
  "shortDescription": "Avalokiteshvara (Sanskrit: \"The Lord Who Looks Down\"), known as Guanyin in China, Kannon in Japan, and Chenrezig in Tibet, is the bodhisattva of infinite compassion (karuna). He embodies the compassionate activity of all Buddhas, hearing the cries of suffering beings throughout the universe and responding with skillful means to liberate them. He has vowed not to enter final nirvana until all sentient beings are freed from Samsara .",
  "longDescription": "The most iconic manifestation features 1,000 arms radiating like a sun, each hand bearing an eye in its palm, representing Avalokiteshvara 's ability to see and respond to suffering throughout all realms simultaneously. The 1,000 arms symbolize his limitless capacity to help beings, while the eyes represent wisdom seeing the true nature of suffering. This form arose from his vow to help all beings—when he realized the immensity of suffering, his head split into eleven pieces from anguish. His spiritual father amitabha reconstructed him with eleven heads (representing the ten perfections plus enlightenment) and 1,000 arms to fulfill his vast compassionate vow.\n\nThe most common form in Tibetan Buddhism shows four arms:\n\nOften depicted in the lalitasana posture (royal ease), with one leg extended and one folded, wearing princely ornaments and silk garments, crowned with an image of Amitabha Buddha.\n\nThe simplest representation shows Avalokiteshvara with two arms in the Anjali mudra (prayer gesture), holding a lotus blossom, emphasizing accessibility and intimate connection with devotees.\n\nFeatures eleven faces arranged in tiers:\n\nIn Indian and Tibetan traditions, Avalokiteshvara appears primarily as male, embodying the masculine principle of active compassion (upaya - skillful means). In East Asian Buddhism (China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam), the deity gradually transformed into the feminine Guanyin/Kannon , the Goddess of Mercy, demonstrating the bodhisattva's teaching that ultimate compassion transcends gender. This feminine form became especially popular during the Song Dynasty (960-1279 CE) in the manifestation of White-Robed Guanyin (白衣觀音), often depicted holding a willow branch and water vase, granting children, healing, and protection to sailors.\n\nAvalokiteshvara 's defining characteristic is his bodhisattva vow to postpone his own final enlightenment until every sentient being across all realms and time is liberated from suffering. This vow represents the Mahayana ideal that individual liberation is incomplete while others suffer.\n\nAccording to the Karandavyuha Sutra , after eons of tireless work liberating beings, Avalokiteshvara looked out across the universe and saw that despite his efforts, the ocean of suffering remained as vast as ever. For every being he freed, countless more fell into Samsara . The realization of the seemingly infinite nature of his task caused his head to explode into eleven pieces from the anguish of compassion.\n\nHis spiritual father amitabha appeared and reassembled him with:\n\nThis transformation symbolizes that true compassion grows stronger, not weaker, when confronted with the magnitude of suffering. It also teaches that bodhisattva compassion is not naive optimism but clear-eyed recognition of suffering combined with unwavering commitment to alleviate it.\n\nॐ मणि पद्मे हूँ (Om Mani Padme Hum) is perhaps the most famous mantra in Buddhism, inseparable from Avalokiteshvara . It is said that all the teachings of the Buddha are contained within these six syllables.\n\nAccording to the Mani Kambum and other texts, reciting this mantra:\n\nTibetan: Om Mani Peme Hung (ཨོཾ་མ་ཎི་པདྨེ་ཧཱུྃ) Sanskrit: Om Mani Padme Hum (ॐ मणि पद्मे हूँ) Traditionally recited 108 times (one mala) or in multiples thereof. The mantra is often inscribed on prayer wheels, carved on mani stones, and written on prayer flags.",
