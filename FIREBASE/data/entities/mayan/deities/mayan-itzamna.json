  "shortDescription": "The supreme creator god of the Maya pantheon, Itzamna is the lord of the heavens, inventor of writing and the calendar, master of medicine and learning. Depicted as a wise, aged man or as a great cosmic caiman, he dwells in the highest of the thirteen heavens and is the father of countless gods. With his consort Ixchel, he presides over creation, knowledge, and the healing arts that sustain humanity.",
  "longDescription": "Itzamna stands among the first and greatest of Maya deities, existing before the world took shape. In some accounts, he is the supreme creative force who brought the universe into being through his divine will. As the great cosmic caiman, his body formed the framework of creation - his back became the earth, his scales the mountains, while the sky stretched above his domain.\n\nClassical period Maya inscriptions place Itzamna at the apex of the divine hierarchy. He appears as the patron deity of the day Ahau (Lord), the most prestigious day in the Maya calendar, and his blessing was essential for the legitimacy of Maya kings who claimed divine descent and connection to cosmic order.\n\nOne of Itzamna's most important manifestations is as Itzam Cab Ain , the \"Earth Caiman\" or cosmic crocodile. This vast reptilian being floats upon the primordial waters, his ridged back forming the surface of the earth. The World Tree grows from his spine, connecting the underworld in his belly to the heavens above.\n\nIn iconography, this cosmic caiman appears with a vegetation symbol on its head (representing the earth's fertility) and often with starry markings on its body (representing the night sky). The creature's dual nature - both earthly and celestial - embodies Itzamna's role as lord of both day and night, heaven and earth.\n\nTogether with his consort Ixchel, Itzamna fathered the Bacabs - four gods who support the four corners of the sky at the cardinal directions. He is also credited as the father of many other deities in the Maya pantheon. As the divine patriarch, he established the order of the cosmos and the proper relationships between gods, humans, and the forces of nature.\n\nAmong Itzamna's greatest gifts to humanity was the invention of writing. The Maya script - one of the few complete writing systems independently developed in human history - was attributed to this divine creator. Books ( huun ) were sacred objects, and scribes were honored as practitioners of a divine art inherited from Itzamna himself.\n\nItzamna also gave humanity the calendar, that remarkable mathematical and astronomical achievement that allowed the Maya to track time across vast cycles. The sacred Tzolk'in (260-day ritual calendar) and the solar Haab (365-day calendar) were divine knowledge essential for scheduling rituals, agricultural activities, and understanding one's destiny. Itzamna, as patron of the day Ahau, presided over the proper keeping of these sacred counts.\n\nItzamna was revered as the divine healer, the source of all medical knowledge. Colonial sources record that Maya healers invoked Itzamna and Ixchel in their healing rituals, seeking the blessing of these patron deities of medicine. The art of healing was seen as a sacred practice, connecting the human healer to divine knowledge.\n\nMaya medicine combined practical herbal knowledge with spiritual practices. Healers ( ah men ) used prayers, rituals, and plant medicines to treat both physical and spiritual ailments. Itzamna's patronage sanctified this tradition and connected it to the cosmic order he established.\n\nItzamna remains one of the most important figures in reconstructing Maya religion and understanding their cosmological concepts. His role as supreme creator and inventor of writing makes him central to scholarly understanding of Maya intellectual achievements.\n\nAmong contemporary Maya communities, particularly those maintaining traditional practices, Itzamna is still honored as the great creator and patron of knowledge. Traditional healers continue to invoke his blessing, and his connection to writing and learning resonates with modern Maya cultural revitalization movements that seek to preserve and promote the Maya script and languages.\n\nThe decipherment of Maya hieroglyphics - the writing Itzamna was said to have invented - represents one of the great intellectual achievements of the 20th century, allowing us to finally read the voices of the ancient Maya and understand their complex theological ideas about this cosmic creator.",
