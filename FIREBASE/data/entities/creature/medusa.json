  "fullDescription": "Medusa (Greek: Μέδουσα, 'guardian' or 'protectress') is the most famous of the three Gorgon sisters—Stheno, Euryale, and Medusa herself. Unlike her immortal sisters, Medusa was mortal. According to later traditions, particularly Ovid, Medusa was once a beautiful maiden who served as a priestess in Athena's temple. When Poseidon violated her in Athena's sacred space, the goddess punished Medusa by transforming her beautiful hair into writhing serpents and giving her a gaze that turned all who looked upon her to stone. Medusa dwelt in a remote location at the edge of the world, surrounded by the petrified remains of those who had attempted to face her. The hero Perseus, armed with divine gifts including a mirrored shield from Athena, successfully beheaded Medusa by viewing her reflection. From her severed neck sprang Pegasus the winged horse and Chrysaor, both offspring of Poseidon. Medusa's head retained its petrifying power even after death and was given to Athena, who placed it on her aegis shield. The Gorgoneion (Medusa's face) became one of the most powerful apotropaic symbols in Greek culture, used to ward off evil.",

      "symbolism": "Medusa embodies multiple symbolic layers: she represents the protective-destructive feminine, whose very gaze brings death. The serpent hair connects her to chthonic wisdom and the untamed aspects of nature. Her transformation story (in Ovid) represents the victimization of women and their transformation into monsters by patriarchal divine systems. Yet paradoxically, her severed head becomes the ultimate protective amulet—the victimized woman transformed into guardian. The Gorgoneion face shows how confronting the monstrous/terrifying directly (via reflection) allows one to gain its power. Medusa's ability to petrify represents the paralysis caused by encountering the terrible sublime, or by direct confrontation with trauma or the unconscious.",
      "culturalSignificance": "The Gorgoneion became one of the most widespread protective symbols in ancient Greece, appearing on shields, buildings, temples, coins, and amulets. Medusa represents the apotropaic principle—using a fearsome image to ward off evil. In modern interpretation, Medusa has become a feminist symbol representing women's rage against assault and violation. The phrase 'to turn to stone' derives from her power. Medusa appears throughout Western art as a symbol of beauty-become-terrible, from Caravaggio's painting to Cellini's sculpture. Psychologically, she represents the terrifying aspect of the feminine unconscious that must be confronted (via reflection/consciousness) to gain its transformative power."
