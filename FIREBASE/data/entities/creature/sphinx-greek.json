  "fullDescription": "The Greek Sphinx (Greek: Σφίγξ, from 'sphingein' meaning 'to squeeze' or 'to bind') is a treacherous creature with the head of a woman, the body of a lion, the wings of an eagle, and sometimes a serpent's tail. Unlike the benevolent guardian Sphinx of Egypt, the Greek Sphinx was a malevolent monster sent by the gods (or Hera specifically) to plague the city of Thebes. The Sphinx positioned herself on Mount Phicium outside Thebes and posed a riddle to all travelers: 'What walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening?' Those who failed to answer correctly were strangled and devoured. The plague continued until the hero Oedipus correctly answered 'Man' (who crawls as an infant, walks upright as an adult, and uses a cane in old age). Upon hearing the correct answer, the Sphinx threw herself from her rocky perch to her death. The Sphinx represents the deadly power of enigma, the guardian at the threshold who tests worthiness through intellect rather than strength, and the feminine wisdom that can destroy or elevate depending on one's ability to comprehend.",

      "symbolism": "The Greek Sphinx represents the power of enigma and the deadly nature of unsolved mysteries. Her riddle concerns the stages of human life, symbolizing self-knowledge as the key to passing life's trials—those who don't understand human nature itself are destroyed. The composite form (woman-lion-eagle-serpent) combines human intelligence, leonine strength, aerial perspective, and chthonic wisdom into a guardian who tests all aspects of the traveler. Her position at the threshold of Thebes makes her a liminal guardian who determines who may enter civilized space. The strangling death represents being choked by incomprehension—intellectual failure becomes physical doom. Her suicide upon being solved suggests that enigmas exist only while unsolved; truth defeats mystery. The feminine head represents wisdom's connection to the goddess principle, though turned destructive.",
      "culturalSignificance": "The Sphinx became the archetypal riddler in Western culture, inspiring countless later tales of enigmatic guardians. The term 'sphinx-like' means enigmatic or inscrutable. The riddle of the Sphinx is one of the most famous riddles in world literature, representing the puzzle of human existence itself. The Sphinx guards the boundary between ignorance and knowledge, wilderness and civilization. In the Oedipus cycle, solving the Sphinx's riddle ironically demonstrates Oedipus's intelligence while foreshadowing his failure to solve the riddle of his own identity. The Sphinx inspired philosophical discussions about the nature of riddles, knowledge, and self-understanding. Unlike the Egyptian Sphinx (guardian), the Greek Sphinx is an active threat, making her defeat a true heroic achievement."
