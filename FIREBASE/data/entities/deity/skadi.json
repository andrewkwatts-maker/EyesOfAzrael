The gods offered her a husband from among them, but she could only choose by looking at their feet. She chose what she thought were Baldr's beautiful feet, but they belonged to Njord. The marriage failed because Skadi could not bear the cries of seagulls at the shore, and Njord could not sleep with the howling of wolves in the mountains. She is also associated with the binding and torture of Loki, whom she helped bind with his son's entrails."
