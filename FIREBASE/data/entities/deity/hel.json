Hel agreed to release Baldr only if all things in the world would weep for him. When one giantess (Loki in disguise) refused to weep, Hel kept Baldr, saying \"Let Hel hold what she has.\"\n\nThe Journey to Helheim: The road to Hel is long and dark, crossing the bridge Gjallarbrú over the river Gjöll. The giantess Modgud guards the bridge, and the terrible hound Garmr guards the gates."
