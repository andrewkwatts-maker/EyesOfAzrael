Born of nine mothers, the shining god needs less sleep than a bird and waits eternally for the day he must blow Gjallarhorn to summon the gods to their final battle.",

        "content": "Guardian of Bifrost: Heimdall dwells in Himinbjorg (\"Heaven's Cliffs\") at the top of the rainbow bridge, watching for any approach of giants or enemies to Asgard. His senses are so keen he can hear grass growing on the earth and wool growing on sheep. He can see equally well by night as by day, for a hundred leagues in any direction. He needs less sleep than a bird, making him the perfect eternal sentinel.\n\nGjallarhorn - The Ringing Horn: Heimdall possesses the great horn Gjallarhorn (\"Resounding Horn\"), which can be heard throughout all the Nine Worlds. It hangs hidden beneath Yggdrasil or rests at Mimir's well where Odin sacrificed his eye. When Ragnarok begins, Heimdall will blow Gjallarhorn to summon all gods and Einherjar to the final battle.\n\nThe Rigsthula - Father of Mankind's Classes: In the Eddic poem Rigsthula, Heimdall walks among humans disguised as \"Rig\" (King). He visits three households - poor, middle-class, and noble - and fathers children by each wife. From these unions come the three classes of Norse society: thralls (slaves), karls (free farmers), and jarls (nobles). This myth establishes Heimdall as a divine ancestor of humanity and explains the social order.\n\nRecovery of Freyja's Necklace: When Loki stole Brisingamen, the famous necklace of Freyja, it was Heimdall who pursued him. The two gods fought in the form of seals on a skerry at Singastein, and Heimdall emerged victorious, recovering the precious jewel. This tale establishes the ancient enmity between Heimdall and Loki."

Harbors and promontories with clear views of approaching ships were considered under his protection. The threshold of the home - the boundary between domestic and outer worlds - was his domain in daily worship.",
          "offerings": "Heimdall received offerings appropriate to his nature: mead poured at dawn, gold objects reflecting his golden teeth and horse, white animals (especially rams), and libations at doorways and harbor entrance stones. Unlike the blood sacrifices to Odin, Heimdall's offerings tended toward the symbolic - light, sound (bells, horns), and items representing vigilance."
