Originally a pillar used by the Dragon King of the Eastern Sea to measure ocean depths, this divine iron staff can shrink to the size of a needle or grow to cosmic proportions. Weighing 13,500 jin (17,550 lbs), it is inscribed with gold bands and responds to its master's commands. The staff is nearly indestructible and serves as both weapon and tool throughout the Journey to the West.",
