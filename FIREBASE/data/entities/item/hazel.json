  "fullDescription": "The Hazel tree (Corylus avellana) was revered in Celtic tradition as the tree of wisdom, poetry, and divination. According to Irish mythology, nine hazel trees grew around the Well of Wisdom, dropping their nuts into the water where they were eaten by the Salmon of Knowledge. The consumption of hazelnuts was believed to grant poetic inspiration, prophecy, and mystical insight. Hazel rods were the preferred wood for divination wands and dowsing.",
