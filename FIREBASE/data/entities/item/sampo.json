  "fullDescription": "The Magical Mill of Endless Prosperity The Sampo stands as the most enigmatic and central artifact in Finnish mythology, featured\n                    prominently in the Kalevala, the Finnish national epic compiled by Elias Lonnrot from traditional\n                    folk poems. Despite its crucial importance to the narrative, the exact nature of the Sampo remains\n                    deliberately mysterious. It is described as a magical object that brings prosperity and good fortune\n                    to its possessor, but its precise form has been interpreted variously as a mill, a world pillar, a\n                    magical vessel, or something entirely beyond physical categorization.",
