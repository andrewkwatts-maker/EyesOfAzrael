According to the Gospel of John, this was the lance used\n                    by a Roman soldier to pierce the side of Jesus Christ as he hung upon the cross, verifying his death\n                    and fulfilling ancient prophecy. The act, though intended as a final indignity, became instead a moment\n                    of profound theological significance, as blood and water flowed from Christ's wound.",
