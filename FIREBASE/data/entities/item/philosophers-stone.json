Far more\n                    than a mere chemical compound, the Stone embodies the culmination of alchemical knowledge, spiritual\n                    development, and cosmic understanding. Its creation was considered the Magnum Opus, the Great Work\n                    that occupied alchemists from ancient Alexandria through medieval Europe and into the Renaissance.",
