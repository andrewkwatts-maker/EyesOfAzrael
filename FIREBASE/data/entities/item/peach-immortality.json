  "fullDescription": "The Peaches of Immortality (蟠桃, pántáo) are celestial fruits that grow in the sacred garden of Xi Wangmu, the Queen Mother of the West, on Mount Kunlun. These divine peaches ripen only once every 3,000, 6,000, or 9,000 years depending on the tree, with the oldest granting the highest levels of immortality and cosmic power. Consuming these peaches grants eternal life, supernatural abilities, and transformation into a xian (immortal). The Jade Emperor hosts the legendary Peach Banquet every 3,000 years where celestial beings feast on these fruits.",

Peach imagery appears in art, literature, birthday celebrations (especially for elders), and festivals. The peach blossom is also a symbol of spring renewal and romantic love."
