  "longDescription": "The Aesir represent the structured, ordered aspects of Norse cosmology - war, sovereignty, law, and civilization. Led by Odin the Allfather, they dwell in the fortified realm of Asgard at the crown of Yggdrasil. After warring with the Vanir (fertility gods), the two tribes merged through an exchange of hostages, creating the unified Norse pantheon. The Aesir's fate is sealed at Ragnarök, where they will fall defending the cosmos against chaos.",
