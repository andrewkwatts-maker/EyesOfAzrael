  "shortDescription": "The supreme judicial and legislative council of ancient Israel, consisting of seventy-one elders, which provided the model for early church decision-making including the selection of Matthias",
  "fullDescription": "The Sanhedrin (Greek: Συνέδριον, 'sitting together'; Hebrew: סנהדרין) was the supreme council of the Jewish people during the Second Temple period and beyond. Rooted in Moses' appointment of seventy elders to share the burden of leadership (Numbers 11:16-17), the Great Sanhedrin consisted of seventy-one members: the High Priest as president, and seventy elders representing scholarly and priestly families. The council met in the Chamber of Hewn Stone (Lishkat Ha-Gazit) within the Temple complex, deliberating on matters of religious law, capital cases, and national policy. Its procedures emphasized careful deliberation: in capital cases, the youngest members spoke first (to avoid influence by elders), a simple majority could acquit but conviction required a majority of two, and verdicts could not be rendered on the same day as the trial. This model of communal discernment profoundly influenced early church governance. When the apostles gathered to select Matthias as Judas's replacement (Acts 1:15-26), they followed Jewish council procedures: gathering the community (about 120 - similar to the quorum for establishing community institutions), presenting qualified candidates, praying for divine guidance, and making a corporate decision. The Jerusalem Council (Acts 15), where apostles and elders debated Gentile inclusion, explicitly mirrors Sanhedrin procedures with its formal deliberation, testimony, and consensus declaration. The Sanhedrin's combination of human deliberation with seeking divine will through prayer and, earlier, through Urim and Thummim provided the pattern for Christian discernment.",
