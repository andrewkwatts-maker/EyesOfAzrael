  "fullDescription": "Dharma (Sanskrit: धर्म) is one of the most fundamental and complex concepts in Hinduism, representing cosmic law, natural order, righteousness, duty, and moral principles that sustain the universe. Derived from the root 'dhr' meaning 'to sustain' or 'to support,' Dharma encompasses the ethical, moral, social, and spiritual principles that govern individual conduct and cosmic order. At the cosmic level, Dharma is the universal law that maintains the order of the universe (rita). At the individual level, it represents one's specific duties and obligations based on age, caste, gender, and occupation (svadharma). Following one's dharma leads to harmony, prosperity, and spiritual progress, while violating it leads to chaos and suffering. The Bhagavad Gita teaches that performing one's dharma without attachment to results is the path to liberation. Dharma is considered one of the four purusharthas (goals of human life), along with artha (prosperity), kama (pleasure), and moksha (liberation).",

The concept includes religious duties (puja, rituals), moral conduct (ahimsa, truthfulness), social obligations (family duties), and cosmic law. Texts like the Dharma Shastras and Manusmriti codify dharma for different life stages and social classes. The Mahabharata is fundamentally a story about dharma, its complexity, and the consequences of adhering to or violating it.",

      "symbolism": "Dharma represents the fundamental order that holds the cosmos together. Like the laws of physics govern the material world, dharma governs the moral and spiritual dimensions. The wheel (chakra) often symbolizes dharma, representing its constant turning and application in all situations. Dharma's connection to 'sustaining' shows that righteousness literally holds reality together. The complexity of dharma - that different people have different dharmas - represents the nuanced, contextual nature of ethics rather than absolute commandments.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Dharma is arguably the most important concept in Hindu thought, influencing every aspect of life from daily routines to major life decisions. The pursuit of dharma has shaped Indian civilization, law, social structure, and ethics for millennia. Political leaders invoke dharma, businesses claim to operate according to dharma, and individuals constantly navigate dharmic dilemmas. The concept has influenced Buddhism (as dhamma) and Jainism. Modern Hindu reform movements often reinterpret dharma to address contemporary issues."
