  "shortDescription": "Heroic glory and renown won through great deeds, granting immortality through lasting fame",
  "fullDescription": "Kleos (Greek: κλέος, 'glory' or 'renown') is the immortal fame and glory earned through heroic deeds, particularly in battle. For Homeric heroes, kleos represented the highest aspiration—since mortals cannot achieve physical immortality, they could gain kleos aphthiton (imperishable glory) through extraordinary achievements remembered by posterity. Achilles faced the archetypal choice: long life in obscurity or short life with eternal kleos—he chose glory. Kleos was won through arete (excellence), demonstrated in combat, athletic contests, wise counsel, or exceptional generosity. Poets and bards perpetuated kleos through song and story, making the poet essential to the hero's immortality. The concept embodies Greek values of competitive excellence, masculine honor, and the human drive to transcend mortality through memorable deeds.",

      "symbolism": "Kleos symbolizes humanity's response to mortality—if death is inevitable, fame makes life meaningful. The concept represents the social dimension of identity—one exists truly through others' recognition and memory. Kleos embodies competitive excellence (agon) as path to transcendence. The glory won in youth outlasts the aging body, suggesting that spiritual/memorial immortality surpasses physical existence. Kleos also reveals the power of poetry and song—bards grant immortality, making art essential to human meaning.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Kleos was the driving motivation in Homeric society and Greek heroic culture, shaping values of courage, excellence, and memorable achievement. The concept influenced Western ideals of honor, glory, and lasting legacy. 'Glory' and 'renown' in Western military and athletic culture trace to kleos. The tension between life and glory influenced countless literary works exploring heroism's costs. Modern 'hall of fame' institutions embody the kleos principle. The concept remains relevant in discussions of legacy, fame, and what makes life meaningful."
