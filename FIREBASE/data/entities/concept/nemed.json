  "shortDescription": "Sacred space or sanctuary, a consecrated area set apart from the profane world",
  "fullDescription": "Nemed (Irish: sacred, privileged) refers to sacred space in Celtic tradition - areas consecrated and set apart from ordinary use. These include stone circles, sacred groves, springs, burial mounds, and ritual enclosures. A nemed is protected by spiritual power and often by legal prohibition; violating the sanctuary of a nemed brings supernatural punishment. The concept extends to sacred persons (druids, poets) and times (festivals) that share this quality of being set apart.",

The term 'neimheadh' (modern Irish) still means 'sacred' or 'holy.' The legal protection of sacred spaces in Brehon law influenced medieval European concepts of sanctuary."
