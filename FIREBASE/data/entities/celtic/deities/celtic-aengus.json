  "name": "Aengus Óg",
  "icon": "🦢",
  "title": "Celtic - Aengus Óg",
  "subtitle": "God of Love, Youth, and Poetic Inspiration",
  "shortDescription": "The Young Son, born of a love affair between the Dagda and the river goddess Boann. Aengus embodies romantic love, youth that never fades, dreams and visions, and the sweet magic of poetry and music. He is perpetually young and beautiful, surrounded by birds that are kisses transformed, and his harp music can enchant any heart.",
  "longDescription": "Aengus appears in some of Irish mythology's most romantic and moving tales. His stories celebrate love's power to overcome obstacles, the magic of dreams, and the lengths to which one will go for true love. He is also a trickster figure who uses cleverness and magic to achieve his ends.\n\nBrugh na Bóinne (Newgrange), the great Neolithic passage tomb in County Meath, is Aengus's primary dwelling. This ancient monument, older than the pyramids of Egypt, was believed to be a sidhe mound - a fairy dwelling - and specifically the palace of Aengus. The River Boyne (named for his mother Boann) and all its surrounding landscape are sacred to him. Any place where swans gather, especially in pairs, is a place where Aengus's presence may be felt.\n\nTraditional offerings to Aengus include:\n\nAengus is invoked for finding true love, protecting existing love relationships, poetic and musical inspiration, prophetic dreams (especially of one's destined love), eternal youth and beauty, and healing a broken heart.\n\n\"Aengus Óg, Young Son of the Dagda, Lord of Love and Dreams, you who searched all Ireland for your heart's desire, Hear my prayer. Send your birds of kisses to sing in my beloved's ear, Let your music enchant our hearts together, Grant us love as enduring as your own, As beautiful as swans upon the water. Aengus of the Brugh, Dream Lord, by the power of your eternal youth, Bless this love and make it true.\"\n\nAengus 's myth, particularly \"The Dream of Aengus,\" has inspired artists and writers for centuries:\n\nW.B. Yeats: The great Irish poet was deeply influenced by Aengus mythology. His poem \"The Song of Wandering Aengus\" (1899) reimagines the god as a mortal seeking his dream-woman: \"I went out to the hazel wood, / Because a fire was in my head...\" The poem captures the eternal longing and quest for idealized love that Aengus represents.\n\nCeltic Revival Art: During the Irish Celtic Revival of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Aengus appeared frequently in paintings and illustrations, usually depicted as an ethereally beautiful young man surrounded by birds and swans.\n\nNewgrange Connection: The association of Aengus with Newgrange adds archaeological mystery to his mythology. The passage tomb's famous roof-box, which allows sunlight to penetrate the chamber only at winter solstice dawn, may connect to myths of time-manipulation (like the sun standing still for his birth) or the liminal nature of his conception between day and night.\n\nModern Paganism: Contemporary Celtic practitioners honor Aengus as a god of love, making him an important figure in handfasting ceremonies (Celtic wedding rituals) and love magic. His story of dreaming his beloved into existence resonates with visualization and manifestation practices.",
