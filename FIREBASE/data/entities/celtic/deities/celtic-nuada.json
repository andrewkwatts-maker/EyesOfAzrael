  "icon": "🗡️",
  "title": "Celtic - Nuada Airgetlám",
  "subtitle": "King of the Tuatha Dé Danann - He of the Silver Hand",
  "shortDescription": "First king of the Tuatha Dé Danann , the divine tribe who brought magic and civilization to Ireland. Nuada lost his hand in battle against the Fir Bolg, rendering him unfit to rule by Celtic law. Restored to kingship by a magical silver hand crafted by the divine physician Dian Cécht , he embodies sovereignty, justice, martial prowess, and the sacred bond between ruler and land.",
  "longDescription": "Nuada stands at the center of the mythological history of Ireland, leading the Tuatha Dé Danann through their greatest trials. His story spans two great battles - the First and Second Battles of Mag Tuired (Moytura) - which established the gods' dominion over Ireland and their ultimate victory against chaos.\n\nNuada wielded one of the Four Treasures of the Tuatha Dé Danann - the Sword of Light (Claíomh Solais). This was one of four magical objects the Tuatha Dé brought with them when they came to Ireland:\n\nThese treasures represent the divine gifts that legitimize sacred kingship: the sword of justice, the spear of protection, the cauldron of abundance, and the stone of sovereignty.\n\nAs king, Nuada 's primary sacred site was Tara (Teamhair), the seat of the High Kings of Ireland. The Hill of Tara in County Meath was the ceremonial and spiritual center of Irish sovereignty, where the Stone of Fál would cry out to confirm the rightful king. Other sites associated with Nuada include Mag Tuired (the Plain of Pillars) where both great battles were fought.\n\nTraditional offerings to Nuada would include:\n\nNuada is invoked for rightful leadership and just rule, victory in battle, healing from wounds (physical and symbolic), restoration after loss, sovereignty and legitimate authority, and protection of one's people.\n\n\"Nuada Airgetlám, King of the Shining Ones, Wielder of the Sword that knows no defeat, Though wounded, you rose to rule again. Grant me the courage to face my battles, The wisdom to lead with justice, The strength to rise after every fall. Silver-Handed Lord, first king of the gods, Hear my prayer and guide my sword arm. By the light of Claíomh Solais, May I stand as you did - unbroken.\"\n\nNuada shows strong connections to other Indo-European sky/sovereignty gods:\n\nNodens (Romano-British): Nuada is linguistically and mythologically connected to the British god Nodens, worshipped at the temple of Lydney in Gloucestershire. Nodens was associated with healing, hunting, and the sea. The name Nuada/Nodens derives from a root meaning \"to acquire, possess\" or \"cloud-maker.\"\n\nThe Fisher King: Many scholars see Nuada as a prototype for the Fisher King of Arthurian legend - a wounded king whose injury affects the prosperity of his land, who can only be healed by a worthy hero. The theme of the maimed king whose restoration brings fertility to the land is central to both figures.\n\nTyr (Norse): Both Nuada and Tyr are kings/judges among their respective gods who lose a hand in service to their people. Tyr lost his to the wolf Fenrir; Nuada lost his in battle. Both represent the willing sacrifice of the ruler for the good of the community.",
