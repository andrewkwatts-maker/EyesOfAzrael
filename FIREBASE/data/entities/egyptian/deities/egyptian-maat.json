  "shortDescription": "Ma'at is both goddess and cosmic principle, embodying truth , justice , harmony, balance, order , and righteousness. She is the foundation of Egyptian civilization and the moral law that governs both gods and humans. Ma'at represents the opposite of chaos ( isfet ) and her feather weighs souls in the afterlife. To \"do ma'at \" meant to live righteously, maintain social order , and uphold divine law.",
  "longDescription": "Ma'at is unique among Egyptian deities as she represents both a goddess and an abstract cosmic principle. Living according to ma'at was the highest duty of pharaohs, priests, and commoners alike.\n\nMa'at was honored in every temple throughout Egypt, as she was essential to all divine worship. She had no major independent temples, as her presence was required everywhere. Every act of worship, every offering, every prayer was an affirmation of ma'at .\n\nLiving according to ma'at was a daily practice for all Egyptians:\n\nIn the afterlife judgment, the deceased recites the Negative Confession before 42 divine judges, denying sins:\n\n\"I have not committed sin. I have not robbed. I have not slain people. I have not told lies. I have not been angry without cause. I have not committed adultery. I have not made anyone suffer. I have not diminished the food offerings in temples. I have not caused pain. I have not killed sacred animals...\"\n\nEach denial affirms the deceased lived according to ma'at and deserves eternal life .\n\nMa'at transcended simple goddess worship to become the foundational philosophy of Egyptian civilization:",
