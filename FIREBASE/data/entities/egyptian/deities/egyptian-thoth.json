  "title": "Thoth - God of Wisdom & Writing | Egyptian Mythology",
  "subtitle": "God of Wisdom, Writing, Magic, and the Moon",
  "shortDescription": "Thoth is the ibis-headed god of knowledge, writing, science, and magic. As the divine scribe, he records the judgment of souls and maintains the cosmic order . Master of hieroglyphs and sacred wisdom, Thoth embodies the intellectual and magical power of the written word and serves as mediator, messenger, and keeper of divine secrets.",
  "longDescription": "Thoth 's mythology emphasizes his role as mediator, healer, and keeper of sacred knowledge. He serves the gods through wisdom rather than force, resolving conflicts through words and magic.\n\nThoth 's primary cult center was Hermopolis Magna (Khmun, \"City of Eight\") in Middle Egypt, where he was worshipped as creator god and leader of the Ogdoad (eight primordial deities ). Sacred baboons and ibises were kept, mummified, and buried in catacombs at Tuna el-Gebel near Hermopolis. He was also venerated at Abydos, Memphis, and throughout Egypt in temples where scribes worked.\n\nOfferings to Thoth included: papyrus scrolls, writing implements, incense (frankincense), white linen, ibis feathers, offerings of baboon or ibis (symbolic or actual mummies), wine, milk, bread. Scribes made offerings before beginning important writings, asking for Thoth 's guidance to write accurately and powerfully.\n\nScribes invoked: \" Thoth , Lord of Divine Words , guide my hand. Grant me skill in writing, clarity in thought, power in my words. Make my hieroglyphs perfect, my calculations true. As you recorded the judgment of the gods, so make my records accurate and enduring.\"\n\nStudents prayed: \" Thoth , open my mind to wisdom. Grant me understanding of sacred knowledge. Make me swift in learning, retentive in memory, skilled in all arts. As you are master of all sciences, make me worthy to learn your secrets.\"\n\nMagicians called upon Thoth 's power in spells, as his words carried divine authority and creative force.\n\nThoth 's influence extended far beyond ancient Egypt:",
