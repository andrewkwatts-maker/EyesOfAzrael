  "subtitle": "Guardian of the Dead, Lord of Mummification, Guide of Souls",
  "shortDescription": "Anubis is the ancient jackal-headed god of death, mummification, and the afterlife. As the original lord of the necropolis and guide of souls through the Duat , Anubis stands as protector of the dead and guardian of the scales of judgment. His presence ensures proper burial rites and safe passage to the realm of Osiris .",
  "longDescription": "Anubis 's mythology centers on death, preservation, and judgment. As one of the oldest gods in the Egyptian pantheon, his role evolved from lord of the dead to psychopomp and guardian of mummification secrets.\n\nAnubis 's primary cult center was Cynopolis (Hardai, \"City of the Dog\") in Upper Egypt. He was also worshipped at necropolis sites throughout Egypt, particularly at Abydos , Memphis, and Thebes. Every tomb and embalming workshop was considered sacred to Anubis , and his priests (called \"Imy-ut\" or \"He who is in the place of embalming\") performed funerary rites.\n\nOfferings to Anubis included: myrrh and frankincense (embalming materials), natron (purification salt), linen bandages, black dogs or jackals (symbolic), bread and beer, ox meat, incense. Offerings were placed at tomb entrances and in funerary temples, asking for Anubis 's protection of the deceased and safe passage through the underworld .\n\nPrayers to Anubis emphasized his protective role: \"Homage to you, Anubis , who dwells in the embalming chamber. Grant that I may enter the Hall of Two Truths with a pure heart. Guard my body in the sacred land. Lead me safely through the passages of the Duat . Let your hand be upon me in the hour of judgment. May I stand justified before Osiris , my heart lighter than the feather of Ma'at .\"\n\nEmbalmers invoked: \" Anubis , Lord of Secrets, guide my hands in this sacred work. Preserve this flesh that the ba may return. Purify this body that it may be worthy of eternal life . As you preserved Osiris , so preserve this servant of the gods.\"\n\nAnubis appears in several iconic forms:\n\nHis black color represents both the color of decomposition and the fertile black soil of the Nile, symbolizing regeneration and rebirth after death.",
