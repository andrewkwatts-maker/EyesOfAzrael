  "shortDescription": "Nephthys is the mysterious goddess of death, night, and mourning in ancient Egyptian mythology. As the \"Lady of the House\" and \"Lady of Hidden Things,\" she presides over funerary rites, protects the dead on their journey through the underworld , and stands as the divine mourner alongside her sister Isis . Though wife of Set , she aided Isis in resurrecting Osiris and is mother to Anubis through a union with Osiris . Her presence represents the unseen aspects of existence—darkness, secrets, and the transition between life and death.",
  "longDescription": "Nephthys 's mythology centers on her roles as divine mourner, protector of the dead, and guardian of hidden knowledge. Though married to Set , she allied with Isis and Osiris , representing the complexity of loyalty and the power of compassion over obligation.\n\nNephthys is most commonly depicted as a woman wearing the hieroglyphic symbols for \"house\" and \"basket\" on her head—her name itself. She often appears with outstretched wings, protecting the dead, or standing as one of the four guardian goddesses at the corners of coffins and canopic shrines. In her role as divine mourner, she mirrors Isis , both appearing as kite birds circling the body of Osiris .\n\nHer presence represents the necessary darkness that complements light, the death that makes resurrection meaningful, and the hidden knowledge accessible only to those who pass through the veil. As \"Lady of the House,\" she guards the temples and tombs—the sacred houses of gods and the eternal houses of the dead.",
