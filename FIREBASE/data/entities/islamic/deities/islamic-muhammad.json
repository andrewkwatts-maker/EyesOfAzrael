  "longDescription": "محمد - The Seal of Prophets (Khatam an-Nabiyyin)\n\nThe final prophet and messenger of Allah, born 570 CE in Makkah. Through him, Allah delivered the complete and final revelation—the Quran—bringing the message of pure monotheism to all humanity until the Day of Judgment.\n\nMuhammad was born in 570 CE during the \"Year of the Elephant,\" when Abraha's army attempted to destroy the Kaaba. His father Abdullah died before his birth, and his mother Aminah passed away when he was six. Raised first by his grandfather Abdul-Muttalib, then by his uncle Abu Talib, Muhammad experienced the vulnerability of orphanhood—a condition that would later deeply influence his teachings on social justice and care for the vulnerable.\n\nEven before prophethood, Muhammad was renowned for his impeccable character. The Quraysh tribe gave him the title \"Al-Amin\" (The Trustworthy) and \"Al-Sadiq\" (The Truthful). He worked as a merchant, known for honesty in business dealings. At age 25, he married Khadijah bint Khuwaylid, a wealthy merchant woman 15 years his senior, who recognized his integrity and character.\n\nMuhammad had a contemplative nature and would retreat to the Cave of Hira on Mount Jabal al-Nour for meditation and reflection. He was troubled by the idolatry, social injustice, and moral decay in Makkan society. These retreats prepared him for the momentous event that would change history.\n\nFirst Revelation: Angel Jibreel appears in Cave Hira with the command \"Iqra!\" (Read/Recite). The first verses of Surah Al-Alaq are revealed, marking the beginning of prophethood.\n\nPrivate Preaching: Muhammad shares the message with close family and friends. Early converts include Khadijah (wife), Ali (cousin), Abu Bakr (friend), and Zayd (adopted son).\n\nPublic Declaration: Commanded to preach publicly. Stands on Mount Safa and calls the Quraysh to monotheism. Persecution of Muslims begins.\n\nFirst Migration to Abyssinia: Due to intense persecution, some Muslims emigrate to the Christian kingdom of Abyssinia (Ethiopia), where King Negus offers them protection.\n\nGreat Loss: Deaths of Khadijah (beloved wife and first supporter) and Abu Talib (protective uncle). Muhammad loses his greatest personal and political protectors.\n\nIsra and Mi'raj: The miraculous Night Journey from Makkah to Jerusalem, followed by ascension through seven heavens to the Divine Presence. Five daily prayers ordained.\n\nHijrah (Migration): Muhammad and Muslims migrate from Makkah to Yathrib (later named Madinah). This marks Year 1 of the Islamic calendar. Constitution of Madinah established.\n\nBattle of Badr: Muslims defend against Makkan aggression. Victory despite being outnumbered 3:1, seen as divine assistance. Angels led by Jibreel reportedly participated.\n\nBattle of Uhud: Muslims suffer setback due to tactical error. Muhammad wounded but survives. Lesson in following prophetic leadership and maintaining discipline.\n\nBattle of the Trench: Madinah defended by innovative trench warfare strategy suggested by Persian companion Salman al-Farsi. Confederate forces unable to breach defenses.\n\nTreaty of Hudaybiyyah: Peace treaty with Makkah. Initially disappointing to Muslims, it becomes a \"clear victory\" allowing peaceful spread of Islam.\n\nLetters to Kings: Muhammad sends emissaries to Byzantine, Persian, and other rulers, inviting them to Islam. Universal message declared beyond Arabian Peninsula.\n\nConquest of Makkah: After Quraysh break treaty, Muslims peacefully enter Makkah with 10,000 followers. Muhammad forgives former persecutors, destroys idols in Kaaba.\n\nYear of Delegations: Arabian tribes send representatives to pledge allegiance to Islam. Arabia largely unified under monotheistic message.\n\nFinal Sermon: Muhammad delivers comprehensive sermon at Mount Arafat, emphasizing human equality, rights of women, sanctity of life and property. Revelation completed: \"Today I have perfected your religion for you\" (Quran 5:3).\n\nDeath: After brief illness, Muhammad passes away in Madinah, head in Aisha's lap. Buried where he died. Abu Bakr addresses shocked companions: \"Whoever worshipped Muhammad, know that Muhammad is dead. Whoever worshipped Allah, know that Allah is alive and never dies.\"\n\nWhen asked about Muhammad's character, his wife Aisha said: \"His character was the Quran.\" He embodied the principles he preached: honesty, justice, mercy, patience, and complete submission to Allah. His companions noted that he never sought revenge for personal wrongs but only defended divine boundaries.\n\nMuhammad's primary miracle is the Quran itself—an illiterate man producing literary masterpiece that has remained unchanged for 1400 years. The Quran challenged contemporaries to produce even one chapter matching its eloquence; none succeeded despite Arabia's rich literary culture.\n\nMuhammad's sayings (Hadith) and actions (Sunnah) form the second source of Islamic law after the Quran. His daily practices—from hygiene to worship to social conduct—provide Muslims with practical guidance for every aspect of life. The science of Hadith authentication became one of history's most rigorous systems of historical verification.\n\nSufis view Muhammad as the Perfect Human (Al-Insan al-Kamil), the complete manifestation of divine attributes in human form. He represents the goal of spiritual development—complete annihilation of ego (fana) and subsistence in Allah (baqa).\n\nSome Sufi traditions teach that Muhammad's spiritual essence was the first creation—a primordial light from which all existence emerged. This concept emphasizes his cosmic significance beyond historical personhood. The phrase \"Were it not for you, I would not have created the universe\" is attributed to this understanding.",
