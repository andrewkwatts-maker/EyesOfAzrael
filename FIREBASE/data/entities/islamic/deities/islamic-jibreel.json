  "longDescription": "The Angel of Revelation - Ruh al-Qudus (The Holy Spirit)\n\nThe greatest and most honored of all angels, entrusted with delivering divine revelation from Allah to His prophets. Jibreel is the intermediary between the Divine and humanity, the bringer of guidance and spiritual strength.\n\nJibreel is the greatest of all angels, standing closest to Allah's throne. Created from pure light, he possesses no free will and exists solely to execute Allah's commands. His primary function is delivering divine revelation, but he also serves as a source of spiritual strength and guidance.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad saw Jibreel in his true angelic form only twice. The angel's magnificence was so overwhelming that his 600 wings filled the horizon from east to west. Each wing was adorned with pearls and rubies. However, Jibreel typically appeared to prophets in human form, most commonly as a man named Dihya al-Kalbi, known for his extraordinary beauty.\n\nJibreel appeared to Muhammad in the Cave of Hira in 610 CE, commanding him to \"Read!\" (Iqra!). This was the beginning of the Quranic revelation that would continue for 23 years. Jibreel would visit periodically to deliver verses, and Muhammad would memorize and recite them to his companions.\n\nJibreel accompanied the Prophet Muhammad on the miraculous night journey from Makkah to Jerusalem (Isra) and then through the seven heavens to the Divine Presence (Mi'raj). During this journey, the five daily prayers were ordained. Jibreel served as guide, protector, and witness to this extraordinary spiritual experience.\n\nIn one of the most famous hadith, Jibreel appeared to the Prophet's companions in the form of a man dressed in pure white with jet-black hair, showing no signs of travel. He questioned Muhammad about Islam, Iman (faith), and Ihsan (excellence), effectively teaching the fundamental structure of the religion. After he departed, the Prophet revealed: \"That was Jibreel; he came to teach you your religion.\"\n\nJibreel's relationship with the Prophet Muhammad was unique in scope and intimacy. For 23 years, he was Muhammad's constant spiritual companion, teacher, and friend. The angel would appear sometimes daily, sometimes weekly, delivering revelation, answering questions, and providing guidance on complex matters.\n\nJibreel represents the intermediary link in the chain of divine communication: Allah → Jibreel → Prophet → Humanity\n\nThis chain emphasizes that prophets do not access divine knowledge directly but receive it through angelic mediation, maintaining the transcendence of Allah while enabling human guidance.\n\nBelief in angels, particularly Jibreel, is one of the six pillars of Islamic faith (Iman). The Quran explicitly states that denial of Jibreel is equivalent to disbelief:\n\nSufi tradition views Jibreel as the archetype of the spiritual guide and the embodiment of active intellect. He represents the bridge between divine knowledge and human understanding. Some Sufis interpret the appearance of Jibreel as symbolic of the awakening of spiritual consciousness within the seeker.",
