Creator and Sustainer of all existence, beyond all comparison, possessing absolute perfection in all attributes.\n\nTawhid (absolute monotheism) is the cornerstone of Islamic theology. Allah is One in essence, attributes, and worship. He has no partners, equals, parents, or offspring. He is eternal (no beginning), everlasting (no end), self-sufficient (needs nothing), and unlike anything in creation.\n\nAllah has 99 names mentioned in Islamic tradition, each revealing a different aspect of His perfect nature. The Prophet Muhammad said: \"Allah has ninety-nine names, one hundred minus one. Whoever knows them will enter Paradise.\" (Sahih Bukhari)\n\nNote: There exists a 100th name known only to Allah Himself, or to those to whom He reveals it through spiritual unveiling (kashf).\n\nIn the name of Allah, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful.\n\nAll praise is for Allah—Lord of all worlds,\n\nthe Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful,\n\nMaster of the Day of Judgment.\n\nYou alone we worship. You alone we ask for help.\n\nGuide us along the Straight Path—\n\nthe path of those You have blessed, not those You are displeased with, or those who are astray.\n\n- Quran 1:1-7",
