Above him, beyond all the archontic spheres,\n                dwelling in ineffable light and perfect silence, is the Monad - the true Father revealed by\n                Christ. This is the distinction between the god of this world and the\n                God of eternity, between the ruler of matter and the source of spirit, between law and grace, judgment and love,\n                fear and gnosis. Understanding this difference is the key to spiritual liberation.",
