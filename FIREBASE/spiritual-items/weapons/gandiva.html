            <div class="content-text">
                <p>
                    Gandiva (Sanskrit: गाण्डीव, Gāṇḍīva) stands as the most celebrated bow in Hindu epic literature,
                    a celestial weapon of such power and prestige that its very name became synonymous with martial
                    excellence and divine favor. As the primary weapon of Arjuna—third Pandava brother and greatest
                    archer of the Mahabharata—Gandiva represents not merely a tool of warfare but the manifestation
                    of dharma (righteousness) enacted through martial prowess.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike mortal-crafted bows that require constant maintenance and eventually wear out, Gandiva is
                    eternal and indestructible, crafted by Lord Brahma himself at the dawn of creation. The bow
                    possesses its own consciousness and will, choosing its wielders carefully and granting victory
                    only to those who fight for righteous causes. It is said that the bow contains within it the
                    combined power of one hundred thousand ordinary bows, making its wielder effectively invincible
                    against conventional forces.

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4 class="subsection-title">Physical Characteristics:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Construction:</strong> Fashioned from celestial wood that never decays or breaks,
                    with a bowstring (jyā) made from cosmic energy that never requires replacement and cannot be cut
                    by any earthly weapon</li>
                    <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Radiant golden-yellow hue that glows with divine light, adorned
                    with intricate carvings of celestial beings and cosmic symbols representing the elements and
                    divine forces</li>
                    <li><strong>Size and Proportions:</strong> Perfectly balanced for Arjuna's use, appearing as a
                    tall bow (approximately six feet) that adapts to its wielder, though descriptions vary from text
                    to text regarding exact dimensions</li>
                    <li><strong>Sound:</strong> When drawn, Gandiva produces a distinctive thunderous twang
                    (Gāṇḍīva-dhvani) that reverberates across the battlefield, striking terror into enemies and
                    rallying allies—the sound alone could frighten opposing armies</li>
                    <li><strong>Weight:</strong> Seemingly light as a feather to Arjuna but impossibly heavy to
                    unworthy wielders; only those blessed with divine strength and proper authorization could even
                    lift it, much less draw it</li>
                    <li><strong>Mystical Properties:</strong> The bow emanates divine energy (tejas) visible as an
                    aura of golden light surrounding both weapon and wielder, marking them as divinely favored</li>
                    <li><strong>Self-Sustaining Nature:</strong> Never requires repair, restringing, or maintenance;
                    the bowstring remains perpetually taut and ready, the wood never warps or cracks despite endless
                    use in the most extreme conditions</li>
                    <li><strong>Quiver Association:</strong> Accompanied by two inexhaustible quivers (akṣayya
                    tūṇīra) gifted alongside the bow, ensuring the archer never runs out of arrows regardless of how
                    many are fired—each arrow is perfectly crafted and flies true</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="content-text">
                <p>
                    The visual representation of Gandiva in temple art, manuscript illustrations, and folk
                    traditions shows remarkable consistency: always depicted as luminous and larger than ordinary
                    bows, often shown with Arjuna in his iconic pose with the bow drawn, Krishna by his side as
                    charioteer. The bow's curvature follows the classical Indian bow design (dhanu), with pronounced
                    recurve at the tips, though its supernatural nature transcends normal functional requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ancient texts describe how the battlefield itself seemed to transform when Arjuna wielded
                    Gandiva. The sky would darken with the density of his arrows, each shaft flying with such
                    precision that they could weave patterns in the air, create defensive walls, or pierce through
                    multiple enemies in succession. The bow enabled Arjuna to engage in incredible feats such as
                    the "Bhāradvāja Astra"—a technique where arrows would split mid-flight and multiply, creating
                    an impenetrable storm of projectiles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The symbolic meaning embedded in Gandiva's physical form reflects Hindu cosmological concepts.
                    The bow's arc represents the vault of heaven, the string symbolizes cosmic order (ṛta), and the
                    arrow stands for individual action aligned with universal dharma. When Arjuna draws Gandiva, he
                    metaphorically draws together all these cosmic elements, becoming an instrument through which
                    divine will manifests in the material world.

        <!-- CREATION MYTH -->
        <div class="glass-card">
            <h3 class="section-title">Creation Myth and Crafting</h3>
            <div class="content-text">
                <p>
                    The origin of Gandiva reaches back to the earliest moments of cosmic creation, making it one of
                    the primordial weapons forged when the universe itself was young. According to the Mahabharata
                    and various Puranic sources, Lord Brahma—the creator deity responsible for manifesting the
                    material universe—personally crafted this bow to serve as the ultimate weapon for maintaining
                    dharma (cosmic order and righteousness) through the ages.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Brahma's Divine Craftsmanship</h4>
                <p>
                    Brahma created Gandiva during a period when the cosmic balance between dharma and adharma
                    (unrighteousness) was being established. The gods (devas) required supremely powerful weapons to
                    combat the asuras (demons/anti-gods) who threatened to overthrow cosmic order. While other
                    divine weapons were created for specific purposes or deities, Gandiva was fashioned as an
                    instrument of pure martial supremacy—a bow that would guarantee victory to any righteous warrior
                    who wielded it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The materials used in Gandiva's construction came from the most sacred and powerful sources in
                    the cosmos. Some traditions state that Brahma used wood from the celestial Kalpavriksha (the
                    wish-fulfilling tree of Indra's paradise), while others suggest he gathered materials from the
                    cosmic tree Ashvattha (the eternal fig that represents the universe itself). The bowstring was
                    woven from threads of pure cosmic energy—the same primordial force that binds the universe
                    together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Brahma infused Gandiva with several divine blessings during its creation. He chanted mantras
                    from the Vedas as he worked, embedding sacred sound vibrations into the weapon's very structure.
                    He invoked the power of all five elements—earth, water, fire, air, and ether—ensuring the bow
                    could channel any elemental force. Most significantly, he granted it sentience and purpose:
                    Gandiva would serve only righteousness and could never be used for unjust causes.
                </p>

                    Upon its completion, Gandiva did not immediately pass to Arjuna but went through a succession of
                    divine and semi-divine wielders across the ages, each using it to uphold cosmic order in their
                    respective epochs:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>First Wielder - Soma (Chandra):</strong> The Moon God, Soma, was Gandiva's first
                    bearer. During an ancient conflict between the devas and asuras, Soma used the bow to defend the
                    celestial realms. The association with the Moon God is significant—Soma represents the mind
                    (manas) in Vedic thought, suggesting that Gandiva requires not just physical strength but mental
                    clarity, emotional control, and strategic wisdom to wield effectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Second Wielder - Varuna:</strong> After Soma, the bow passed to Varuna, the ancient
                    Vedic god of cosmic order, oceans, and truth. Varuna is the guardian of ṛta (cosmic law), making
                    him an ideal custodian for a weapon that enforces righteousness. During Varuna's tenure, Gandiva
                    was used to bind and punish oath-breakers and maintain the moral order of the universe. Varuna
                    kept the bow for thousands of divine years, stored in his underwater palace.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Transfer to Agni:</strong> Eventually, Varuna gifted Gandiva to Agni, the god of fire,
                    who would become instrumental in passing it to Arjuna. The reason for this transfer is connected
                    to a specific need: Agni required assistance in consuming the Khandava Forest (described below),
                    and only with Gandiva's power could this task be accomplished against the opposition of Indra.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Arjuna Receives Gandiva - The Khandava-daha Parva</h4>
                <p>
                    The transfer of Gandiva to Arjuna is one of the most significant events in the Mahabharata,
                    detailed in the Khandava-daha Parva (The Burning of Khandava Forest). This episode occurs during
                    the Pandavas' prosperous period in Indraprastha, before the infamous dice game that would lead
                    to their exile.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Agni, the fire god, appeared to Arjuna and Krishna in the form of a Brahmin, seeking their help.
                    Agni had been cursed to suffer from digestive ailments after consuming excessive amounts of
                    sacrificial ghee at King Svetaki's prolonged yajna (ritual sacrifice). The only cure was to
                    consume the Khandava Forest—a vast, ancient woodland teeming with life, including the Naga
                    (serpent) king Takshaka and his kin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, Indra (king of gods and Arjuna's divine father) protected Khandava Forest because his
                    friend Takshaka lived there. Whenever Agni attempted to burn the forest, Indra would send rain
                    to extinguish the flames. Agni needed warriors powerful enough to prevent Indra's intervention—
                    and only Arjuna and Krishna possessed such capability.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "O Phalguna, take this celestial bow Gandiva, imperishable and foremost among all bows, and these
                two inexhaustible quivers. With this bow, you will be invincible in battle, like unto a second
                Mahadeva (Shiva) himself. This bow was created by Brahma, wielded by Soma, then by Varuna, and now
                by me. I now give it to you, who are worthy of wielding it."
                <br><br>— Agni to Arjuna, Mahabharata, Adi Parva
            </div>

            <div class="content-text">
                <p>
                    Agni invoked Varuna, who immediately appeared from the waters with Gandiva, the two
                    inexhaustible quivers, and a divine chariot with celestial horses bearing the emblem of Hanuman.
                    Agni also provided Krishna with the Sudarshana Chakra (though Krishna, being an avatar of
                    Vishnu, already possessed it in his divine form) and the Kaumodaki mace.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus armed, Arjuna and Krishna assisted Agni in consuming Khandava Forest over fifteen days.
                    Arjuna created a canopy of arrows to prevent Indra's rain from reaching the flames, demonstrating
                    Gandiva's power for the first time. He shot arrows with such speed that they formed an unbroken
                    shield over the entire forest. Even when Indra himself appeared with the full host of heaven,
                    Arjuna—wielding Gandiva—matched his divine father's might, neutralizing every celestial weapon
                    Indra deployed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This event established several crucial facts: First, Gandiva could enable a mortal (albeit a
                    divinely-born one) to contend with the king of gods. Second, Arjuna had been tested and proven
                    worthy—the bow accepted him as its rightful wielder. Third, Krishna and Arjuna's partnership was
                    divinely sanctioned, a preview of their roles in the Kurukshetra War where Krishna would serve
                    as Arjuna's charioteer and guide.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">The Sacred Bond</h4>
                <p>
                    From the moment Arjuna first drew Gandiva, a mystical bond formed between archer and bow. The
                    weapon became an extension of Arjuna's will, responding to his thoughts as much as his physical
                    actions. This connection was so profound that when Arjuna doubted or wavered in righteousness—
                    as he did at the beginning of the Kurukshetra War—even Gandiva could not grant him its full
                    power until Krishna's Bhagavad Gita discourse restored his clarity of purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The tradition holds that Gandiva chose Arjuna specifically because of his unique combination of
                    qualities: unmatched martial skill, unwavering devotion to dharma, humility despite supreme
                    prowess, and most importantly, his relationship with Krishna. Arjuna was not merely a warrior
                    but an instrument of divine will, and Gandiva recognized in him the perfect vessel for its
                    power.

                <p>
                    Gandiva's powers extend far beyond those of any mortal-crafted weapon, placing it among the most
                    formidable divine arms in Hindu mythology. The bow does not merely amplify the wielder's
                    strength—it transforms them into a force of nature, capable of facing gods, demons, and entire
                    armies with equal confidence. The Mahabharata and associated texts enumerate numerous specific
                    abilities granted by this celestial bow.

                    <strong>Inexhaustible Ammunition</strong>
                    The two divine quivers provided with Gandiva contain an infinite supply of arrows. No matter
                    how many arrows Arjuna fired—whether thousands in a single minute or millions over days of
                    continuous battle—the quivers magically replenished themselves. Each arrow was perfectly crafted,
                    perfectly balanced, and imbued with celestial energy.

                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Infallible Accuracy (Akṣaya Accuracy)</strong>
                    Arrows fired from Gandiva never miss their intended target unless countered by equally powerful
                    divine weapons. The bow grants perfect accuracy at any distance, in any conditions. Arjuna could
                    strike specific points on an enemy's body, pierce through armor and shields, or thread arrows
                    through impossibly small gaps with absolute certainty.

                    <strong>Supernatural Penetration</strong>
                    Gandiva's arrows could pierce any material—armor, shields, even mystical defenses—unless
                    specifically protected by divine blessings of equal or greater power. Multiple warriors could be
                    pierced by a single shaft, which would continue traveling until Arjuna willed it to stop or
                    until it encountered a supernatural barrier.

                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Rapid-Fire Capability</strong>
                    Arjuna could draw and release arrows from Gandiva with supernatural speed, creating the
                    illusion of continuous streams of projectiles filling the air. Texts describe him firing "a
                    hundred thousand arrows" in rapid succession, creating arrow-storms that blotted out the sun and
                    appeared as solid walls of shafts moving through the air.

                    <strong>Astra Channeling</strong>
                    Gandiva served as the perfect vehicle for launching astras—divine weapons invoked through
                    mantras. While other bows might shatter or burn when channeling such power, Gandiva could safely
                    discharge any astra, from the Agneyastra (fire weapon) to the devastating Brahmastra. The bow
                    amplified the power of these astras beyond their normal capacity.

                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Defensive Capabilities</strong>
                    Beyond offense, Gandiva enabled Arjuna to create defensive barriers by firing arrows in
                    patterns that would intercept incoming weapons, create walls of shafts, or even weave net-like
                    structures in mid-air. He could shoot down other arrows, stop rain, or create protective canopies
                    over allied forces.

                    <strong>Sound Weapon (Dhvani-astra)</strong>
                    The distinctive thunderous sound (Gāṇḍīva-dhvani) produced when drawing Gandiva served as a
                    weapon itself. This terrifying roar could cause enemy warriors to lose courage, horses to bolt,
                    and elephants to panic. The sound announced Arjuna's presence on the battlefield and often caused
                    opponents to flee before a single arrow was fired.

                    <strong>Invincibility in Battle</strong>
                    The Mahabharata explicitly states that no warrior bearing Gandiva could be defeated in
                    righteous combat. While this didn't make Arjuna literally immortal or immune to injury, it meant
                    that as long as he fought for dharma and wielded the bow, ultimate victory was assured. The
                    weapon's power guaranteed that justice would prevail.

                    <strong>Energy Manifestation</strong>
                    Gandiva could fire arrows of pure energy that carried no physical substance yet dealt
                    devastating damage. These energy projectiles were particularly effective against supernatural
                    beings who might be immune to physical weapons. The bow could also channel elemental forces—
                    creating arrows of fire, water, wind, or other elements as needed.

                    enemies who used maya (illusion) or fought under cover of magical darkness. The bow's radiance
                    represented truth cutting through deception.

                    The mere sight of Arjuna wielding Gandiva had profound psychological effects on opponents.
                    The bow's legendary reputation meant that warriors often lost hope before combat even began.
                    Conversely, allied forces gained tremendous morale from seeing their champion armed with the
                    invincible bow.

                    <strong>Divine Durability</strong>
                    Gandiva could not be damaged, burned, broken, or worn out by any means. It remained pristine
                    through years of constant warfare, exposure to divine weapons, and the channeling of incredible
                    destructive forces. The bow was, in essence, indestructible—eternal and unchanging like the
                    dharma it served.

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Limitations and Conditions</h4>
                <p>
                    Despite its overwhelming power, Gandiva was not without limitations—primarily moral and
                    spiritual rather than physical. The bow's sentient nature meant it would not grant its full
                    power to a wielder who acted unrighteously or fought for unjust causes. If Arjuna's purpose
                    wavered or his actions strayed from dharma, Gandiva's effectiveness would diminish proportionally.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This limitation manifested most dramatically at the beginning of the Kurukshetra War. When
                    Arjuna experienced moral crisis and refused to fight his relatives, he found himself unable to
                    even lift Gandiva. The bow became heavy, his hands trembled, and his famous skill abandoned him.
                    Only after Krishna's teachings in the Bhagavad Gita restored Arjuna's understanding of his
                    dharmic duty did Gandiva's power fully return to him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, while Gandiva made its wielder nearly invincible, it could not overturn fate or
                    the will of the supreme divine. When the time came for Arjuna to relinquish the bow (after
                    Krishna's departure from the world), Gandiva's power waned. The weapon had fulfilled its cosmic
                    purpose, and no force—not even Arjuna's skill or devotion—could maintain its might beyond its
                    destined span.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, Gandiva required proper respect and ritual maintenance. While it never physically
                    degraded, the sacred relationship between bow and archer needed to be preserved through
                    appropriate worship, mantras, and righteous conduct. Arjuna performed regular pujas (worship
                    ceremonies) for Gandiva, treating it not merely as a weapon but as a divine presence deserving
                    reverence.

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Arjuna - The Third Pandava</h4>
                <p>
                    Arjuna (Sanskrit: अर्जुन, meaning "bright," "shining," or "white"), also known as Partha,
                    Dhananjaya ("winner of wealth"), and Phalguna, stands as the central hero of the Mahabharata.
                    Son of Pandu and Kunti, but divinely fathered by Indra (king of gods), Arjuna embodied the
                    ideal Kshatriya (warrior)—combining martial excellence, devotion to dharma, humility, and
                    spiritual wisdom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Arjuna's character represents the synthesis of action and knowledge, warrior prowess and
                    philosophical depth. He was the only student of Drona to master all forms of warfare, including
                    the use of divine weapons (astras). His devotion to Krishna, whom he recognized as the Supreme
                    Being, made him the ideal recipient for the Bhagavad Gita's teachings—spiritual wisdom delivered
                    in the midst of a battlefield crisis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The relationship between Arjuna and Gandiva symbolizes the proper alignment of power with
                    purpose. Without Arjuna's righteousness, Gandiva would be merely a powerful weapon; without
                    Gandiva's power, Arjuna could not fulfill his cosmic role as the instrument through which
                    dharma was restored to the world. Together, archer and bow became a single unified force for
                    cosmic justice.

                        As described in the creation section, Arjuna first demonstrated Gandiva's power during the
                        burning of Khandava Forest. Facing Indra himself—his divine father and king of gods—Arjuna
                        wielded Gandiva to create an impenetrable canopy of arrows that prevented rain from
                        extinguishing Agni's flames. For fifteen days and nights, Arjuna maintained this defense,
                        shooting down Indra's weapons and neutralizing the attacks of the entire celestial host.

                        This event established several crucial precedents: Gandiva could enable a mortal to contend
                        with gods, Arjuna had proven himself worthy of the bow's power, and the partnership between
                        Krishna and Arjuna was divinely sanctioned. During this episode, Arjuna also saved Maya, the
                        great asura architect, who out of gratitude built the magnificent Maya Sabha (assembly hall)
                        for the Pandavas in Indraprastha.

                    <p><strong>The Defeat of the Nivatakavachas</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        During the Pandavas' exile, Arjuna undertook a journey to Indra's heaven (Svarga) where his
                        divine father requested his help against the Nivatakavachas—a race of powerful demons who
                        lived in the ocean and possessed impenetrable armor. These asuras had obtained boons making
                        them immune to weapons of the gods, and even Indra could not defeat them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Arjuna, wielding Gandiva and channeling divine astras taught to him by Indra, descended to
                        the undersea realm of the Nivatakavachas. In a fierce battle lasting several days, Arjuna
                        systematically destroyed the demon armies. Gandiva's power proved superior to their
                        supposedly impenetrable defenses, as the bow's arrows carried the force to bypass their
                        magical protections. This victory further established Arjuna's reputation as the greatest
                        warrior across all the three worlds (Earth, Heaven, and the Underworld).
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>The Battle at Virata (Revealing After Incognito)</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        At the end of the Pandavas' thirteenth year of exile, spent incognito at King Virata's
                        court, Arjuna had hidden Gandiva and his other weapons in a Shami tree outside the city.
                        When the Kauravas attacked Virata's kingdom, the Pandavas revealed themselves, and Arjuna
                        retrieved Gandiva from its hiding place.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Facing an entire Kaurava army single-handedly (with Prince Uttara as his charioteer), Arjuna
                        wielded Gandiva to defeat all the Kaurava warriors including Bhishma, Drona, Karna, Kripa,
                        and Ashvatthama—the most formidable fighters of their age. He used the Sammohana Astra
                        (sleep-inducing weapon) to incapacitate the entire army without killing them, demonstrating
                        both Gandiva's power and his own merciful discrimination. This battle confirmed that the
                        Pandavas had completed their exile and showcased Gandiva's might to both armies before the
                        great war.

                    <p><strong>The Kurukshetra War - Eighteen Days of Combat</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Gandiva's most extensive use came during the eighteen-day Kurukshetra War, the climactic
                        conflict of the Mahabharata. Throughout this cosmic battle, Arjuna wielded Gandiva to
                        accomplish seemingly impossible feats:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Day One:</strong> After Krishna's Bhagavad Gita teachings restored his resolve,
                        Arjuna used Gandiva to wreak havoc on the Kaurava forces, the bow's roar announcing his
                        renewed commitment to battle</li>
                        <li><strong>The Slaying of Bhishma:</strong> Though bound by a vow not to directly kill his
                        grandsire, Arjuna used Gandiva to fire the arrows that brought down Bhishma—after placing
                        Shikhandi (whom Bhishma would not fight) before him</li>
                        <li><strong>Jayadratha's Death:</strong> When the sun was about to set on the fourteenth day,
                        Arjuna had sworn to kill Jayadratha before sunset or immolate himself. Krishna created an
                        illusion of sunset, and when Jayadratha emerged in celebration, Krishna removed the illusion.
                        Arjuna then used Gandiva to fire an arrow that not only killed Jayadratha but carried his
                        head to his father's lap, fulfilling the curse that whoever dropped Jayadratha's head would
                        have their own head explode</li>
                        <li><strong>The Destruction of Abhimanyu's Killers:</strong> After his son Abhimanyu was
                        unjustly killed by multiple warriors attacking simultaneously, Arjuna went on a rampage of
                        vengeance with Gandiva, destroying vast portions of the Kaurava army</li>
                        <li><strong>The Final Duel with Karna:</strong> The climactic confrontation between Arjuna
                        and Karna saw Gandiva matched against Karna's Vijaya bow (another celestial weapon). Through
                        Krishna's guidance and Gandiva's supreme power, Arjuna ultimately prevailed, killing his
                        half-brother in single combat</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>The Return of Gandiva</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        After Krishna's death and the end of the Dwapara Yuga, Arjuna found his powers waning. When
                        bandits attacked a group of women he was protecting, Arjuna discovered he could barely draw
                        Gandiva, and his arrows had lost their power. He realized that Gandiva's full might was
                        connected to Krishna's presence and his own dharmic purpose, both of which had been fulfilled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Following Krishna's instruction and understanding that his time as a warrior was complete,
                        Arjuna returned Gandiva to Varuna by casting it into the ocean. The bow returned to the god
                        of waters, completing the cycle that had begun when Varuna first entrusted it to Agni for
                        transfer to Arjuna. This poignant moment symbolized the end of an age—the Dwapara Yuga gave
                        way to Kali Yuga, and the time of gods directly intervening through chosen heroes came to a
                        close.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>The Encounter with Hanuman</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        During the Pandavas' exile, Arjuna once encountered Hanuman, the great devotee of Rama and
                        one of the Chiranjivi (immortals). Arjuna, proud of his archery and Gandiva's reputation,
                        questioned why Rama needed to build a bridge of stones to cross to Lanka when he had
                        powerful arrows and could have simply built a bridge of arrows.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hanuman, in humility but also to teach Arjuna a lesson, suggested that perhaps Rama's
                        arrows weren't strong enough to bear weight. Arjuna, stung by this implied criticism of his
                        ancestor, declared he would build a bridge of arrows strong enough to bear Hanuman's weight.
                        Arjuna used Gandiva to create an elaborate bridge of arrows, and Hanuman, in his small form,
                        began to walk across it. But with each step, Hanuman expanded his size and weight until the
                        arrow-bridge collapsed despite Gandiva's power.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Humbled and about to fulfill his vow of self-immolation for failing, Arjuna was stopped by
                        Krishna (revealed as Rama himself). Krishna explained that Hanuman had been testing Arjuna's
                        pride, and that Hanuman in his full form could not be supported by any mortal-created
                        structure, even one made with Gandiva's arrows. This taught Arjuna humility and the
                        understanding that even divine weapons have their place within the cosmic order. Hanuman
                        blessed Arjuna and agreed to reside on Arjuna's chariot banner throughout the Kurukshetra
                        War, providing protection and auspicious presence.

        <!-- SYMBOLISM -->
        <div class="glass-card">
            <h3 class="section-title">Symbolism and Spiritual Meaning</h3>
            <div class="content-text">
                <h4 class="subsection-title">Dharma as Weapon and Purpose</h4>
                <p>
                    Gandiva represents the power of dharma (righteousness) made manifest. The bow's inability to
                    serve unrighteous causes demonstrates the Hindu philosophical principle that true power can only
                    exist in alignment with cosmic order. Arjuna's invincibility while wielding Gandiva is not
                    merely physical superiority but the inevitable triumph of righteousness over unrighteousness.
                    The weapon symbolizes that when action is properly aligned with duty and moral law, success is
                    assured—not through might alone but through the universe's inherent tendency toward dharmic
                    balance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This symbolic dimension explains why Gandiva's power failed when Arjuna's purpose was fulfilled.
                    The bow was not simply a tool but an instrument of cosmic justice, relevant only when the cosmic
                    need for such justice existed. Its return to the gods after the Mahabharata war signified that
                    the particular dharmic crisis requiring such overwhelming power had been resolved.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">The Mind as Bow, Intention as Arrow</h4>
                <p>
                    Hindu spiritual texts often use the metaphor of archery to describe spiritual practice, and
                    Gandiva embodies this symbolism perfectly. The Mundaka Upanishad describes the pranava (Om) as
                    the bow, the atman (self/soul) as the arrow, and Brahman (ultimate reality) as the target. In
                    this metaphorical framework, Gandiva represents the disciplined mind—perfectly controlled,
                    unfailing in its aim, and capable of piercing through the illusions of maya to reach the divine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Arjuna's mastery of Gandiva parallels the yogi's mastery of the mind. Just as Arjuna could fire
                    arrows with perfect accuracy regardless of external conditions, the accomplished spiritual
                    practitioner maintains focus on the divine despite worldly distractions. The bow's infallible
                    nature reflects the efficacy of properly directed spiritual intent—when the mind is truly
                    concentrated on the highest truth, realization becomes inevitable.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Divine Grace and Human Effort</h4>
                <p>
                    Gandiva symbolizes the interplay between divine grace (prasāda) and human effort (puruṣārtha).
                    While the bow granted tremendous power, it still required Arjuna's skill, training, devotion,
                    and unwavering commitment to righteousness. Neither element alone was sufficient—divine favor
                    without human worthiness would have been wasted, while human effort without divine support could
                    not have achieved such cosmic impact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This reflects a central Hindu theological concept: moksha (liberation) requires both grace and
                    effort. The divine provides the means and the opportunity, but the individual must be prepared
                    to receive and properly utilize these gifts. Arjuna's reception of Gandiva came only after years
                    of disciplined training, demonstrated virtue, and proven commitment to duty—he had to be worthy
                    before grace could fully manifest.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">The Kshatriya Ideal</h4>
                <p>
                    Gandiva embodies the Kshatriya (warrior class) dharma in its highest form. The bow represents
                    the power that protects society, maintains order, and defends righteousness through force when
                    necessary. However, this power is tempered by strict moral limitations—Gandiva serves only
                    righteous causes, just as the ideal Kshatriya uses violence only in service of justice, never
                    for personal gain or unjust conquest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The tradition of Kshatriya dharma emphasized that martial power without moral guidance becomes
                    tyranny, while moral principles without the power to defend them become mere idealism. Gandiva
                    symbolizes power and principle united—strength in service of righteousness, violence constrained
                    by ethics, and martial skill directed by wisdom.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">The Guru-Disciple Relationship</h4>
                <p>
                    The transmission of Gandiva through successive divine beings—from Brahma to Soma to Varuna to
                    Agni to Arjuna—reflects the guru-parampara (lineage of teachers) concept central to Hindu
                    spiritual tradition. Sacred knowledge and power are not randomly distributed but carefully passed
                    from worthy teacher to worthy disciple, each guardian maintaining and honoring what they receive
                    before passing it to the next generation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Arjuna's reception of Gandiva was not merely a transaction but an initiation into a lineage of
                    cosmic guardians. He received not just a weapon but a responsibility, a legacy, and a sacred
                    trust. His eventual return of the bow to Varuna completed the cycle, demonstrating that even the
                    greatest gifts are held in stewardship, not ownership—they must ultimately return to their
                    source.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Sound and Creation</h4>
                <p>
                    The distinctive thunderous sound of Gandiva's bowstring (Gāṇḍīva-dhvani) connects to the Hindu
                    concept of shabda (sacred sound) as a creative and destructive force. Just as the universe was
                    created through the cosmic sound Om, and just as mantras possess power through their vibrations,
                    Gandiva's sound carried tangible force—striking fear, inspiring courage, and announcing divine
                    presence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This sonic aspect emphasizes that in Hindu cosmology, sound is not merely an effect but a cause—
                    vibrations that can alter reality itself. The bow's roar was not just noise but a manifestation
                    of cosmic power, a verbal command from the divine realm enforcing order upon the material world.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Modern Relevance</h4>
                <p>
                    In contemporary Hindu thought and Indian cultural consciousness, Gandiva remains a powerful
                    symbol of several virtues:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Excellence and Mastery:</strong> "Like Arjuna with Gandiva" is a common idiom for
                    supreme skill in any field</li>
                    <li><strong>Righteous Power:</strong> The bow represents power that serves justice rather than
                    self-interest, relevant in discussions of ethical leadership and governance</li>
                    <li><strong>Divine Partnership:</strong> Arjuna-and-Gandiva symbolizes the perfect alignment of
                    tool and user, relevant in discussing human relationship with technology and power</li>
                    <li><strong>Focused Intent:</strong> In motivational and educational contexts, Gandiva's
                    infallible accuracy represents the power of concentrated attention and clear purpose</li>
                    <li><strong>National Identity:</strong> As part of India's epic heritage, Gandiva appears in
                    national discourse about Indian military tradition, valor, and strategic capability</li>
                </ul>
