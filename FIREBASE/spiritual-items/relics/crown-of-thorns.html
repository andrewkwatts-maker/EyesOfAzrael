                <p>
                    The Crown of Thorns is one of the most significant relics in Christian tradition, believed to be the
                    woven crown of thorny branches placed upon Jesus Christ's head by Roman soldiers during his Passion.
                    This instrument of mockery and torture, intended to ridicule Christ's claim to kingship, has become
                    one of the most powerful symbols of Christian devotion, representing the suffering Christ endured
                    for humanity's salvation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The relic currently preserved at Notre-Dame de Paris (temporarily housed at the Louvre following
                    the 2019 fire) consists of a ring of woven rushes or reeds, approximately 21 centimeters in diameter,
                    bound together without visible thorns. The thorns themselves were distributed as separate relics
                    throughout medieval Christendom, with various churches claiming to possess individual thorns from
                    the original crown.

            <h3 class="section-title">Biblical Origin and Passion Narrative</h3>
            <div class="content-text">
                <p>
                    The Gospel accounts describe the crowning with thorns as part of the mockery Jesus endured following
                    his condemnation by Pontius Pilate. Roman soldiers, aware that Jesus had been accused of claiming
                    to be King of the Jews, fashioned a crown from thorny branches as a cruel parody of royal regalia.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand:
                and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!"
                <br><br>— Matthew 27:29 (KJV)
            </div>

            <div class="content-text">
                <h4 class="subsection-title">The Theological Significance</h4>
                <p>
                    In Christian theology, the Crown of Thorns carries profound symbolic meaning beyond its historical
                    reality. The thorns connect to the Genesis narrative, where thorns and thistles were part of the
                    curse placed upon the ground after Adam's sin. Christ's wearing of thorns represents his taking
                    upon himself the consequences of human sin and the curse of the Fall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The crown also inverts earthly kingship. While Roman emperors wore laurel wreaths and earthly kings
                    wore golden crowns, Christ accepted a crown of pain. This paradox lies at the heart of Christian
                    understanding: true kingship comes through service and suffering, not through power and domination.
                    The mocking soldiers unwittingly proclaimed a profound truth through their cruelty.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Historical Journey</h4>
                <p>
                    According to tradition, the Crown of Thorns remained in Jerusalem until the fourth century, when
                    Saint Helena, mother of Emperor Constantine, discovered it along with the True Cross and other
                    Passion relics. The crown was subsequently transferred to Constantinople, the new capital of
                    the Christian Roman Empire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1238, Baldwin II, the Latin Emperor of Constantinople, facing severe financial difficulties,
                    offered the Crown of Thorns to King Louis IX of France. Louis paid an enormous sum for the relic
                    and constructed the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris specifically to house it. The stunning Gothic chapel,
                    with its walls of stained glass, became one of the architectural marvels of medieval Europe.

                <p>
                    Unlike some relics associated with miraculous powers, the Crown of Thorns has primarily served
                    as an object of devotion and meditation rather than a source of reported miracles. Its power
                    lies in its capacity to inspire contemplation of Christ's suffering and to deepen the spiritual
                    lives of the faithful.

                    <li><strong>Penitential Focus:</strong> Inspires believers to unite their own sufferings with Christ's</li>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Veneration Practices</h4>
                <p>
                    The Crown of Thorns is venerated with particular solemnity during Holy Week, especially on Good
                    Friday. At Notre-Dame de Paris, the relic was traditionally displayed for public veneration on
                    the first Friday of each month and every Friday during Lent. The Knights of the Holy Sepulchre
                    and other religious organizations serve as guardians of the relic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The veneration typically involves the faithful processing past the displayed relic, often kissing
                    the reliquary or making a sign of the cross. The sight of the ancient crown, preserved through
                    nearly two millennia, connects believers directly to the events of the Passion.

                    The earliest references to the Crown of Thorns as a preserved relic date from the fourth century.
                    Paulinus of Nola mentions it around 409 CE, and subsequent pilgrims to Jerusalem report seeing
                    it displayed at various holy sites. The crown apparently remained in the Byzantine capital after
                    the fall of the Western Roman Empire, housed in the imperial chapel.

                    The acquisition of the Crown of Thorns became the defining achievement of Saint Louis IX's reign.
                    When Baldwin II offered the crown in 1238, Louis saw an opportunity to bring the most precious
                    relic of Christendom to France. He paid 135,000 livres (about half the annual revenue of the
                    French crown) to Venetian bankers who held it as collateral.

                    Louis personally carried the crown barefoot into Paris, wearing only a simple tunic, in a display
                    of humble piety. He then commissioned the construction of Sainte-Chapelle, completed in 1248,
                    which cost more than the relic itself. The chapel's soaring stained glass windows told the story
                    of the relics it contained and became a masterpiece of Rayonnant Gothic architecture.

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Revolutionary Peril and Survival</h4>
                <p>
                    During the French Revolution, the Crown of Thorns faced destruction along with other religious
                    treasures. The revolutionaries melted down its golden reliquary and scattered its contents.
                    However, local believers secretly preserved the crown itself, hiding it until religious practice
                    was restored under Napoleon. The relic was given a new reliquary and eventually transferred to
                    the treasury of Notre-Dame de Paris.

                <h4 class="subsection-title">The 2019 Fire and Rescue</h4>
                <p>
                    When fire engulfed Notre-Dame de Paris on April 15, 2019, the Crown of Thorns faced its greatest
                    modern peril. Father Jean-Marc Fournier, chaplain of the Paris Fire Brigade, entered the burning
                    cathedral and retrieved the crown from its chapel, ensuring its survival. The relic is currently
                    stored safely at the Louvre until Notre-Dame's restoration is complete.

                    The Crown of Thorns is traditionally grouped with other relics from Christ's Passion, many of
                    which were allegedly discovered by Saint Helena or preserved through similar channels.
