                <h3>The Great Transgression</h3>
                <p>
                    In the days when humanity began to multiply upon the earth, 200 angels known as the Watchers
                    descended from heaven to Mount Hermon. Led by Samyaza and Azazel, they swore a binding oath
                    to take human wives and teach forbidden knowledge to mankind. This catastrophic rebellion
                    against divine law would bring corruption, violence, and ultimately the Great Flood upon the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Book of Enoch names the chief Watchers: Samyaza their leader, Azazel who taught warfare,
                    Araqiel who taught earth's signs, Shamsiel who taught sun signs, Sariel who taught moon courses,
                    Penemue who taught writing, Kasdeja who taught abortion and dark arts, and many more. Each
                    revealed secrets that heaven had forbidden humans to know.

                    from "metator" (guide) or represent the divine throne itself. He is the Voice of God, speaking with
                    divine authority to angels and humans alike.

                <h3>The Divine Names</h3>
                <p>
                    Each angel bears a name ending in -el ("of God") or -yah (shortened YHVH), signifying their
                    divine origin and purpose. These names hold power, and knowing an angel's true name grants
                    authority over them - as Solomon learned when he bound demons. The Books of Enoch preserve
                    hundreds of angelic names, each encoding the angel's function and position in the cosmic hierarchy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Notable Name Patterns:</strong> Michael ("Who is like God?"), Gabriel ("Strength of God"),
