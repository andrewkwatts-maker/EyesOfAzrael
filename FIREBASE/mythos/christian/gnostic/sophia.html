    <h2>The Cosmic Drama of Divine Wisdom</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; max-width: 800px; margin: 1rem auto; line-height: 1.7;">
        Sophia (Σοφία, "Wisdom") stands at the heart of Gnostic theology—the youngest Aeon whose
        passionate desire to know the unknowable Father led to her fall from the Pleroma. Her story
        is humanity's story: separation from divine source, suffering in exile, and ultimate redemption
        through love. She is the divine feminine whose scattered light-sparks are the souls of humanity.
    </p>
</div>

<section class="glass-card">
    <h2 style="color: var(--color-primary); margin-top: 0;">Who is Sophia?</h2>
    <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.1rem;">
        Sophia is the <strong>youngest and final Aeon</strong> of the Pleroma, paired with Theletos (Will).
        She embodies divine wisdom, understanding, and the feminine aspect of God. Her name appears throughout
        scripture—Proverbs personifies Wisdom as a divine woman present at creation. In Gnostic myth, she
        becomes the central figure of the cosmic drama of fall and redemption.
    </p>

    <div class="quote-card">
        "Wisdom calls aloud in the street, she raises her voice in the public squares... 'The Lord brought me forth as the first of his works, before his deeds of old; I was formed long ages ago, at the very beginning, when the world came to be.'"
        <cite>— Proverbs 1:20, 8:22-23 (Sophia in Hebrew Scripture)</cite>
    </div>

    <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 1.5rem;">
        In Gnostic texts, Sophia has multiple aspects:
    </p>
    <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin-left: 2rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
        <li><strong>Sophia (Higher):</strong> The Aeon dwelling in the Pleroma</li>
        <li><strong>Achamoth (Lower Sophia):</strong> Her fallen aspect suffering in the material realm</li>
        <li><strong>Pistis Sophia:</strong> "Faith-Wisdom," emphasizing her trust in redemption</li>
        <li><strong>Barbelo-Sophia:</strong> Sometimes identified with or daughter of Barbelo</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="color: var(--color-primary);">The Three Acts of Sophia's Drama</h2>

    <div class="act-section">
        <h3>Act I: The Fall - Passion Without Balance</h3>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.05rem;">
            Sophia, dwelling in perfect bliss within the Pleroma, conceived a desire that would alter
            the cosmos: she longed to <strong>comprehend the incomprehensible Father</strong>, to know
            the unknowable Monad directly. This desire was not evil—it arose from love and the seeking
            of divine knowledge. But she acted <strong>without her syzygy partner</strong>, Theletos,
            breaking the principle of divine balance.
        </p>

        <div class="quote-card">
            "Sophia... desired to bring forth a likeness out of herself without the consent of the Spirit, and without her consort... And because of the invincible power within her, her thought did not remain idle, and something came out of her which was imperfect and different from her appearance."
            <cite>— The Apocryphon of John</cite>
        </div>

        <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 1.5rem;">
            Her solitary emanation produced a flawed, ignorant being: <strong>Yaldabaoth</strong>, the
            Demiurge—a creature born of passion without knowledge, will without wisdom. Horrified by what
            she had created, Sophia <strong>fell from the Pleroma</strong>, descending into the lower regions.
        </p>

        <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin-left: 2rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
            <li><strong>The Passion:</strong> Desire to know the Father independently</li>
            <li><strong>The Error:</strong> Acting alone, without syzygy balance</li>
            <li><strong>The Product:</strong> Yaldabaoth, ignorant creator</li>
            <li><strong>The Consequence:</strong> Fall from Pleroma, exile in darkness</li>
            <li><strong>The Result:</strong> Creation of material cosmos from her suffering</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="act-section">
        <h3>Act II: The Suffering - Exile and Lamentation</h3>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.05rem;">
            Separated from the Pleroma, Sophia experiences profound suffering. She is in darkness, chaos,
            the formless void—unable to return to the light yet retaining memory of her divine origin.
            Her emotions become the substance of creation:
        </p>

        <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin-left: 2rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
            <li><strong>Her Tears:</strong> Become the waters of the cosmos</li>
            <li><strong>Her Laughter:</strong> Forms light</li>
            <li><strong>Her Fear:</strong> Creates darkness and shadow</li>
            <li><strong>Her Grief:</strong> Solidifies into matter</li>
            <li><strong>Her Longing:</strong> Animates souls with desire for return</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="quote-card">
            "Pistis Sophia cried out loudly towards the Light of lights which she had seen from the beginning, in which she had had faith, and she pronounced this repentance, saying: 'O Light of lights, in whom I have had faith from the beginning, hearken now, O Light, unto my repentance.'"
            <cite>— Pistis Sophia, First Repentance</cite>
        </div>

        <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 1.5rem;">
            Meanwhile, her offspring Yaldabaoth, ignorant of the higher realms, declares himself the only
            god and creates the material cosmos as a prison to trap the light-sparks that fell from Sophia.
            Humanity is formed—bodies of matter but containing <strong>pneuma</strong>, divine sparks of
            Sophia's scattered light.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 1rem; font-weight: bold; color: var(--color-primary);">
            Thus human souls are fragments of Sophia herself, exiled from the Pleroma, longing for home.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="act-section">
        <h3>Act III: The Redemption - Christ's Descent and Sophia's Restoration</h3>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.05rem;">
            The Pleroma does not abandon Sophia. Moved by compassion, the divine realm sends forth
            <strong>Christ</strong>, the divine Savior, who descends through the spheres to accomplish
            a threefold redemption:
        </p>

        <ol style="line-height: 1.8; margin-left: 2rem; margin-top: 1rem; font-weight: 500;">
            <li><strong>Redeem Sophia:</strong> Unite with her, restore her to wholeness</li>
            <li><strong>Enlighten Humanity:</strong> Bring gnosis revealing divine origin</li>
            <li><strong>Defeat Ignorance:</strong> Expose the Demiurge's false claims</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="quote-card">
            "Jesus the Living One answered: 'When I came, I opened the path, and I taught them about the passage through which they will pass, the elect and the solitary, who have known the Father.'"
            <cite>— Gospel of Thomas, Saying 50</cite>
        </div>

        <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 1.5rem;">
            Christ's mission is not to die for sins but to <strong>reveal truth</strong>—to show humanity
            their divine nature, teach the path of return, and reunite with Sophia. Their union is the
            sacred marriage (hieros gamos), the restoration of divine syzygy. As Sophia is redeemed, so
            are all souls that contain her light.
        </p>

    <h2 style="color: var(--color-primary); margin-top: 0;">Sophia's Thirteen Repentances</h2>
    <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
        The text <em>Pistis Sophia</em> records thirteen psalms of repentance spoken by Sophia in her
        suffering, calling out to the Light. These profound prayers express her anguish, faith, and
        ultimate hope in salvation:
    </p>

    <div class="quote-card">
        <strong>From the First Repentance:</strong><br/>
        "O Light of lights, in whom I have had faith from the beginning, hearken now, O Light, unto my repentance. Save me, O Light, for evil thoughts have entered into me... I gazed into the lower regions and saw a light there, and I thought I would reach that region to find the light... But darkness came and seized me."
        <cite>— Pistis Sophia</cite>
    </div>

    <div class="quote-card">
        <strong>From the Thirteenth Repentance:</strong><br/>
        "Hearken unto me, O Light, for thy grace is precious, and look down upon me according to thy great mercy. Turn not thy face from me, for I am exceedingly tormented. Haste thee, hearken unto me, and save my power."
        <cite>— Pistis Sophia</cite>

        <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.05rem;">
            Sophia's drama is not merely cosmic myth but the pattern of <strong>every soul's journey</strong>:
        </p>

        <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin-left: 2rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
            <li><strong>Origin in Light:</strong> Like Sophia, we begin in the Pleroma</li>
            <li><strong>Passionate Seeking:</strong> Our desires, though misdirected, arise from divine longing</li>
            <li><strong>The Fall:</strong> We descend into matter, forgetting our divine origin</li>
            <li><strong>Suffering in Exile:</strong> We experience the pain of separation from the divine</li>
            <li><strong>Retained Spark:</strong> We carry the divine light even in darkness</li>
            <li><strong>The Call:</strong> Christ's gnosis awakens us to remember who we are</li>
            <li><strong>Repentance and Return:</strong> We turn toward the light and ascend</li>
            <li><strong>Ultimate Reunion:</strong> We return to the Pleroma, restored to fullness</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; color: var(--color-primary);">
            To know Sophia's story is to know your own story. Her redemption is the promise of universal
            salvation—all souls will return, all light will be gathered, all will be restored.

    <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.05rem;">
        Sophia represents the recovery of the <strong>divine feminine</strong> suppressed in patriarchal
        theology. Unlike the passive, obedient women of orthodox tradition, Sophia is:
    </p>

    <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin-left: 2rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
        <li><strong>Active Creator:</strong> Her emanation, though flawed, shows creative power</li>
        <li><strong>Passionate Seeker:</strong> Her desire for knowledge drives cosmic drama</li>
        <li><strong>Suffering Redeemer:</strong> Her pain gives birth to souls</li>
        <li><strong>Co-Savior with Christ:</strong> Her reunion with Christ completes redemption</li>

    <div class="quote-card">
        "I am the first and the last. I am the honored one and the scorned one. I am the whore and the holy one. I am the wife and the virgin. I am the mother and the daughter... I am the silence that is incomprehensible and the gnosis whose remembrance is frequent."

    <h2 style="color: var(--color-primary); margin-top: 0;">The Holy Spirit: Feminine Divine Presence Within</h2>

    <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.05rem;">
        In Hebrew, the word for Spirit is <strong>Ruach</strong> (רוח), which is grammatically <em>feminine</em>.
        The Holy Spirit—the indwelling divine presence—carries the feminine aspect of God that Christianity often suppresses.
        When we recognize the Spirit dwelling within us, we encounter the <strong>Sophia-aspect of God</strong>: divine
        Wisdom, nurturing presence, the Mother-Spirit indwelling her children.
    </p>

    <div class="key-teaching">
        <h3>The Spirit Dwelling WITHIN: Feminine Immanence</h3>
        <div class="quote-card">
            "What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God,
            and ye are not your own?"

        </div>
        <div class="quote-card">

        </div>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 1rem;">
            The Spirit <strong>dwells in you</strong>—this is the divine feminine, the Sophia-presence, making her home
            in the human soul. Not the distant Father-God in the sky, but the immanent Mother-Spirit dwelling within,
            nurturing, teaching, comforting. This is Sophia's redemption: she returns from exile by taking up residence
            in every awakened soul.

        <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 1rem;">
            The Comforter (Παράκλητος - <em>Paraklētos</em>) is the Holy Spirit who <strong>abides in you</strong>,
            teaching from within. This is Sophia's role: divine Wisdom dwelling internally, bringing gnosis, awakening
            souls to truth. The anointing <strong>abideth in you</strong>—permanent indwelling of the feminine divine.

        <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 1rem; font-weight: bold; color: var(--color-primary);">
            Notice: "ye need not that any man teach you"—the indwelling Spirit-Sophia teaches directly, eliminating

            Mutual indwelling: we in God, God in us. This is accomplished through the Spirit—the feminine divine presence.
            <strong>"I will dwell IN them and walk IN them"</strong>—not external observation but internal habitation.
            The Mother-Spirit makes her home in her children, dwelling as intimate presence, not distant authority.

        <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 1rem;">
            The Spirit's groaning within us mirrors Sophia's lament in Gnostic texts—the divine feminine in exile,
            longing for reunion with the Pleroma, interceding from within our hearts. The Spirit <strong>itself</strong>
            (not "himself"—the Greek is neuter, preserving the mystery beyond gender) groans within, expressing the
            soul's homesickness for divine origin.

        <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 1rem; font-weight: bold; color: var(--color-primary);">
            This is Sophia's story in biblical language: the divine presence trapped in matter, groaning for liberation,

        The Spirit that <strong>dwelleth in you</strong> is resurrection power—Sophia's divine light quickening dead
        matter, transforming flesh into spirit, raising souls from ignorance to gnosis. The indwelling Spirit-Sophia
        is the hope of universal restoration, dwelling in ALL, awaiting recognition, working toward the day when every
        scattered spark returns to the Pleroma.

    <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.1rem;">
        The Sophia myth culminates in universal hope: as Christ redeems Sophia, gathering all her scattered
        light-sparks, <strong>every soul</strong> will ultimately return to the Pleroma. There is no
        eternal damnation, only varying durations of ignorance before awakening.

    <div class="quote-card">
        "None will be left behind. All the souls that were trapped in matter will be freed. The light will gather all its own, and the Pleroma will be complete again."

    <p style="line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; color: var(--color-primary);">
        Sophia's redemption is humanity's redemption. Her return to the Pleroma is the promise that
        none are lost, all are loved, all will come home to the light.
