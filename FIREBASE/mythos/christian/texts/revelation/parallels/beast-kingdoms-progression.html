<h2>Introduction: Four Empires Become One</h2>
<p>
            Daniel received two visions of world empires: the metallic statue (Daniel 2) and four beasts (Daniel 7-8).
            Both outline the same succession of kingdoms from Babylon to the end times. Revelation 13 and 17 reveal that
            the final antichrist kingdom will be a <strong>composite</strong> of all previous empires—combining the worst
            characteristics of Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome into one ultimate beast system.

<h4>1st Beast: Lion with Eagle's Wings</h4>
<p class="verse-ref">Daniel 7:4</p>
<p class="verse-text">"The first was like a <strong>lion</strong>, and it had the <strong>wings of an eagle</strong>. I watched until its wings were torn off and it was lifted from the ground so that it stood on two feet like a human being, and the mind of a human was given to it."</p>
<p><strong>Kingdom:</strong> <span class="kingdom-gold">Babylon</span></p>
<p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Lion = king of beasts (Babylonian symbol), eagle wings = swift conquest, humanized = Nebuchadnezzar's humbling (Dan 4)</p>
</div>

<h4>2nd Beast: Bear Raised Up</h4>
<p class="verse-ref">Daniel 7:5</p>
<p class="verse-text">"And there before me was a second beast, which looked like a <strong>bear</strong>. It was <strong>raised up on one of its sides</strong>, and it had <strong>three ribs in its mouth</strong> between its teeth. It was told, 'Get up and eat your fill of flesh!'"</p>
<p><strong>Kingdom:</strong> <span class="kingdom-silver">Medo-Persia</span></p>
<p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Bear = strength and ferocity, raised on one side = Persia dominant over Media, three ribs = Babylon, Lydia, Egypt conquered</p>
</div>

<div class="beast-card">
<h4>3rd Beast: Leopard with Four Wings</h4>
<p class="verse-ref">Daniel 7:6</p>

<p><strong>Kingdom:</strong> <span class="kingdom-bronze">Greece</span></p>
<p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Leopard = speed and agility, four wings = Alexander's unprecedented rapid conquest, four heads = empire divided among four generals (Ptolemy, Seleucus, Cassander, Lysimachus)</p>
</div>

<div class="beast-card">
<h4>4th Beast: Terrifying with Iron Teeth</h4>
<p class="verse-ref">Daniel 7:7-8</p>
<p class="verse-text">"After that... there before me was a fourth beast—<strong>terrifying and frightening and very powerful</strong>. It had <strong>large iron teeth</strong>; it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. It was <strong>different from all the former beasts, and it had ten horns</strong>. While I was thinking about the horns, there before me was <strong>another horn, a little one</strong>, which came up among them; and three of the first horns were uprooted before it."</p>
<p><strong>Kingdom:</strong> <span class="kingdom-iron">Rome</span> → <span class="kingdom-final">Final Antichrist Empire</span></p>
<p><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Indescribable = unique brutality, iron teeth = matches iron legs of statue, ten horns = ten-kingdom confederation, little horn = Antichrist</p>

<h4>Theological Significance: The Ultimate Evil Empire</h4>
<p>
            <strong>Why Reverse Order?</strong> Revelation lists the beasts backward (leopard-bear-lion instead of lion-bear-leopard)
            because John is looking <em>back</em> through history from the final empire. The composite beast embodies:
        </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leopard body (Greece):</strong> Speed, cunning, Hellenistic culture and philosophy</li>
<li><strong>Bear feet (Persia):</strong> Crushing strength, overwhelming military might</li>
<li><strong>Lion mouth (Babylon):</strong> Royal authority, idolatrous pride, claim to divine glory</li>
<li><strong>Ten horns (Rome/Final):</strong> Political confederation, iron strength, global dominion</li>
</ul>
<p>
            The final Antichrist kingdom is not just <em>another</em> empire—it is the <strong>summation of all previous empires</strong>,
            combining their worst elements into one satanically-empowered system. All the accumulated evil of human history converges
            in the beast.

<h3>Identification of the Seven Kingdoms</h3>
<p>From John's perspective on Patmos (c. 95 AD):</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="kingdom-gold">Egypt</span> - First great oppressor of God's people (fallen)</li>
<li><span class="kingdom-silver">Assyria</span> - Conquered Northern Kingdom (fallen)</li>
<li><span class="kingdom-bronze">Babylon</span> - Destroyed Jerusalem, exiled Judah (fallen)</li>

<p>
            <strong>Alternative interpretation:</strong> Seven heads = seven specific Roman emperors. Either way, the pattern holds:
            sequential empires culminating in a final satanic ruler who embodies all previous kingdoms.

<h3>Revelation's Synthesis</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revelation 13:</strong> Composite beast (leopard-bear-lion + 10 horns) = All empires unified in Antichrist</li>
<li><strong>Revelation 17:</strong> Seven heads = Seven successive kingdoms (Egypt → Assyria → Babylon → Persia → Greece → Rome → Final)</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> The entire history of human rebellion against God culminates in one final beast system that combines the characteristics of every previous empire</li>
<li><strong>Defeat:</strong> Christ returns as the Stone (Dan 2) and the Son of Man (Dan 7) to crush the statue, slay the beasts, and establish His eternal kingdom (Rev 19-20)</li>
</ul>
