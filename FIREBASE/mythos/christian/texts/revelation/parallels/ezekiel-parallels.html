<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Ezekiel's visionary experiences profoundly shape Revelation's imagery. Both prophets received visions by rivers (Ezekiel by Chebar, John by the sea), both saw God's throne surrounded by living creatures, and both witnessed the New Jerusalem/Temple as God's dwelling with humanity.</p>

<h2>1. The Throne Vision and Four Living Creatures</h2>
<table class="comparison-table">
<thead><tr><th width="50%">Ezekiel 1</th><th width="50%">Revelation 4</th></tr></thead>

<tr>
<td>
<p class="verse-ref">Ezekiel 1:4-5, 10</p>
<p class="verse-text">"I looked, and I saw a windstorm coming... an immense cloud with flashing lightning and surrounded by brilliant light... In the fire was what looked like <strong>four living creatures</strong>... Their faces looked like this: Each of the four had <strong>the face of a human being, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle</strong>."</p>
</td>

<p class="verse-ref">Revelation 4:6-8</p>
<p class="verse-text">"In the center, around the throne, were <strong>four living creatures</strong>... The first living creature was <strong>like a lion</strong>, the second was <strong>like an ox</strong>, the third had <strong>a face like a man</strong>, the fourth was <strong>like a flying eagle</strong>. Each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around, even under its wings."</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<div class="connection-box">
<h4>Theological Connection</h4>
<p>Both visions feature <strong>four cherubim</strong> around God's throne representing all creation (lion = wild animals, ox = domestic animals, man = humanity, eagle = birds). John simplifies Ezekiel's complex description, assigning one face to each creature rather than four faces per creature.</p>

<h2>2. Gog and Magog - The Final Battle</h2>

<p class="verse-ref">Ezekiel 38:2, 15-16; 39:4</p>
<p class="verse-text">"Son of man, set your face against <strong>Gog, of the land of Magog</strong>, the chief prince of Meshek and Tubal... You will come from your place in the far north, you and many nations with you, all of them riding on horses, <strong>a great horde, a mighty army</strong>. You will advance against my people Israel like a cloud that covers the land... On the mountains of Israel you will fall, you and all your troops."</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="verse-ref">Revelation 20:8-9</p>
<p class="verse-text">"[Satan] will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth—<strong>Gog and Magog</strong>—and to gather them for battle. In number they are <strong>like the sand on the seashore</strong>. They marched across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of God's people, the city he loves. But fire came down from heaven and devoured them."</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<div class="connection-box">
<h4>Theological Connection</h4>
<p><strong>Ezekiel 38-39</strong> prophesies a northern invasion against Israel led by Gog. <strong>Revelation 20</strong> uses "Gog and Magog" as symbolic names for the final rebellion of nations against God's people. The ultimate fulfillment comes after the millennium when Satan is released for a short time.</p>

<h2>3. The River of Life from the Temple</h2>
<table class="comparison-table">
<thead><tr><th width="50%">Ezekiel 47</th><th width="50%">Revelation 22</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p class="verse-ref">Ezekiel 47:1, 7, 12</p>
<p class="verse-text">"The man brought me back to the entrance to the temple, and I saw <strong>water coming out from under the threshold of the temple</strong> toward the east... When I arrived there, I saw a great number of trees on each side of the river... <strong>Fruit trees of all kinds will grow on both banks of the river</strong>. Their leaves will not wither, nor will their fruit fail. Every month they will bear fruit, because the water from the sanctuary flows to them. <strong>Their fruit will serve for food and their leaves for healing</strong>."</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="verse-ref">Revelation 22:1-2</p>
<p class="verse-text">"Then the angel showed me <strong>the river of the water of life</strong>, as clear as crystal, <strong>flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb</strong> down the middle of the great street of the city. On each side of the river stood <strong>the tree of life</strong>, bearing twelve crops of fruit, yielding its fruit every month. And <strong>the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations</strong>."</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<div class="connection-box">
<h4>Theological Connection</h4>
<p>Ezekiel's temple river finds its ultimate fulfillment in the <strong>New Jerusalem's river of life</strong>. The source shifts from the temple to <strong>God's throne</strong> because in the new creation, God Himself is the temple (Rev 21:22). Life-giving water and healing leaves signify complete restoration.</p>

<h2>4. Eating the Scroll</h2>
<table class="comparison-table">
<thead><tr><th width="50%">Ezekiel 2-3</th><th width="50%">Revelation 10</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p class="verse-ref">Ezekiel 2:9-10; 3:1-3</p>
<p class="verse-text">"Then I looked, and I saw a hand stretched out to me. In it was a scroll... 'Son of man, eat this scroll I am giving you and fill your stomach with it.' So <strong>I ate it, and it tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth</strong>."</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="verse-ref">Revelation 10:9-10</p>
<p class="verse-text">"So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little scroll. He said to me, 'Take it and eat it. It will turn your stomach sour, but in your mouth it will be <strong>as sweet as honey</strong>.' I took the little scroll from the angel's hand and ate it. <strong>It tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it, my stomach turned sour</strong>."</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<div class="connection-box">
<h4>Theological Connection</h4>
<p>Both prophets <strong>internalize God's Word</strong> before proclaiming it. The sweetness represents the joy of God's truth; the bitterness (in John's case) represents the harsh judgments he must prophesy. The prophet embodies the message.</p>

<h2>5. Measuring the Temple</h2>
<table class="comparison-table">
<thead><tr><th width="50%">Ezekiel 40-42</th><th width="50%">Revelation 11, 21</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p class="verse-ref">Ezekiel 40:3-5</p>
<p class="verse-text">"I saw a man whose appearance was like bronze; he was standing in the gateway with <strong>a linen cord and a measuring rod</strong> in his hand... He said to me, 'Son of man, look carefully and listen closely and pay attention to everything I am going to show you, for that is why you have been brought here. <strong>Tell the people of Israel everything you see</strong>.'"</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="verse-ref">Revelation 11:1; 21:15-16</p>
<p class="verse-text">"I was given <strong>a reed like a measuring rod</strong> and was told, 'Go and measure the temple of God and the altar, with its worshipers.'" (11:1)<br/><br/>"The angel who talked with me had <strong>a measuring rod of gold to measure the city</strong>, its gates and its walls. The city was laid out like a square..." (21:15-16)</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<div class="connection-box">
<h4>Theological Connection</h4>
<p>Ezekiel measured the future temple (chapters 40-48); John measures both the tribulation temple (11:1) and the New Jerusalem (21:15-17). <strong>Measuring signifies God's ownership, protection, and precise design</strong>. What is measured belongs to God and will be preserved.</p>

<h2>6. The Glory of God Fills the Temple</h2>
<table class="comparison-table">
<thead><tr><th width="50%">Ezekiel 43</th><th width="50%">Revelation 15, 21</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p class="verse-ref">Ezekiel 43:2, 4-5</p>
<p class="verse-text">"And I saw <strong>the glory of the God of Israel</strong> coming from the east... and <strong>the land was radiant with his glory</strong>... Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court, and <strong>the glory of the LORD filled the temple</strong>."</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="verse-ref">Revelation 15:8; 21:11, 23</p>
<p class="verse-text">"And the temple was <strong>filled with smoke from the glory of God</strong> and from his power, and no one could enter the temple..." (15:8)<br/><br/>"It shone with <strong>the glory of God</strong>, and its brilliance was like that of a very precious jewel... The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for <strong>the glory of God gives it light</strong>." (21:11, 23)</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<div class="connection-box">
<h4>Theological Connection</h4>
<p>God's <strong>Shekinah glory</strong> that filled the tabernacle (Exodus 40:34-35) and Solomon's temple (1 Kings 8:10-11), which departed before the exile (Ezekiel 10-11), returns in Ezekiel's vision and reaches ultimate fulfillment when <strong>God's glory fills the New Jerusalem</strong>. No temple is needed because God Himself dwells there (Rev 21:22).</p>
</div>

<h2>7. No More Tears or Death</h2>
<table class="comparison-table">
<thead><tr><th width="50%">Ezekiel 37</th><th width="50%">Revelation 21</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p class="verse-ref">Ezekiel 37:12-14, 27</p>
<p class="verse-text">"Therefore prophesy and say to them: 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: My people, I am going to open your graves and bring you up from them... I will put my Spirit in you and <strong>you will live</strong>... <strong>My dwelling place will be with them</strong>; I will be their God, and they will be my people.'"</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="verse-ref">Revelation 21:3-4</p>
<p class="verse-text">"And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, 'Look! <strong>God's dwelling place is now among the people</strong>, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God. He will wipe every tear from their eyes. <strong>There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain</strong>, for the old order of things has passed away.'"</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<div class="connection-box">
<h4>Theological Connection</h4>
<p>Ezekiel's vision of the <strong>valley of dry bones coming to life</strong> and God dwelling with His people finds its consummation in the New Jerusalem. Resurrection, God's presence, and the end of death, tears, and suffering are all fulfilled in the new creation.</p>
