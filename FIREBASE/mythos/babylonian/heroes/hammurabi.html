<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Hammurabi" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../mythos/babylonian/corpus-search.html?term=hammurabi" title="Search corpus for 'Hammurabi'">Hammurabi</a> was the sixth king of the First Dynasty of Babylon, who transformed a minor city-state into the dominant
power of Mesopotamia. He is best known for the Code of <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Hammurabi" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../mythos/babylonian/corpus-search.html?term=hammurabi" title="Search corpus for 'Hammurabi'">Hammurabi</a>, one of the oldest deciphered writings of significant
length in the world, which established comprehensive laws governing Babylonian society. His reign marked the beginning
of Babylon's ascendancy and the establishment of legal principles that would influence civilizations for millennia.
</p>

<h2>Rise to Power</h2>
<h3>Early Reign and Consolidation</h3>
<p>
When <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Hammurabi" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../mythos/babylonian/corpus-search.html?term=hammurabi" title="Search corpus for 'Hammurabi'">Hammurabi</a> ascended to the throne around 1792 BCE, Babylon was a relatively minor power, overshadowed by stronger
neighboring kingdoms such as Larsa, Eshnunna, Elam, and Mari. The first decades of his reign were spent consolidating
power, building infrastructure, and strengthening the city's defenses. He focused on:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fortifying Babylon's walls and expanding the city</li>
<li>Building and maintaining irrigation canals to ensure agricultural prosperity</li>
<li>Establishing temples to honor <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Marduk" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../mythos/babylonian/corpus-search.html?term=marduk" title="Search corpus for 'Marduk'">Marduk</a> and other deities</li>
<li>Cultivating diplomatic relationships through strategic alliances</li>
</ul>

<h3>Strategic Alliances and Conflicts</h3>
<p>
<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Hammurabi" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../mythos/babylonian/corpus-search.html?term=hammurabi" title="Search corpus for 'Hammurabi'">Hammurabi</a> proved himself a masterful diplomat and strategist. He formed alliances with Larsa and Mari against Elam,
then later turned against his former allies to expand Babylonian territory. His military campaigns were methodical:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Year 7-11:</strong> Defeated Uruk and Isin, securing southern Mesopotamia</li>
<li><strong>Year 30:</strong> Conquered Larsa, eliminating his greatest southern rival</li>
<li><strong>Year 31:</strong> Defeated Eshnunna in the north</li>
<li><strong>Year 33-38:</strong> Conquered Mari and other northern territories, unifying Mesopotamia under Babylonian rule</li>
</ul>
<p>
These conquests were not merely military victories but were presented as divinely ordained missions to establish justice
and order throughout the land, fulfilling the will of <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Marduk" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../mythos/babylonian/corpus-search.html?term=marduk" title="Search corpus for 'Marduk'">Marduk</a>.
</p>

<h2>The Code of <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Hammurabi" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../mythos/babylonian/corpus-search.html?term=hammurabi" title="Search corpus for 'Hammurabi'">Hammurabi</a></h2>
<h3>The Great Law Stele</h3>
<p>
<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Hammurabi" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../mythos/babylonian/corpus-search.html?term=hammurabi" title="Search corpus for 'Hammurabi'">Hammurabi</a>'s most enduring achievement is his law code, inscribed on a massive black diorite stele over seven feet tall.
The stele, discovered at Susa in 1901 (where it had been taken as war booty by Elamite invaders), is now housed in the
Louvre Museum in Paris. At the top of the stele is a relief depicting <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Hammurabi" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../mythos/babylonian/corpus-search.html?term=hammurabi" title="Search corpus for 'Hammurabi'">Hammurabi</a> receiving the rod and ring—symbols
of divine authority—from <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Shamash" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../mythos/babylonian/corpus-search.html?term=shamash" title="Search corpus for 'Shamash'">Shamash</a>, the sun god and god of justice.
</p>

<h3>Structure of the Code</h3>
<p>
The Code consists of 282 laws organized thematically, covering:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Civil law:</strong> Property rights, inheritance, contracts, trade regulations</li>
<li><strong>Criminal law:</strong> Murder, theft, assault, false accusations</li>
<li><strong>Family law:</strong> Marriage, divorce, adoption, custody, adultery</li>
<li><strong>Commercial law:</strong> Wages, prices, liability of merchants and professionals</li>
<li><strong>Agricultural law:</strong> Land rental, irrigation responsibilities, crop damage</li>
<li><strong>Professional liability:</strong> Responsibilities of builders, physicians, boat pilots</li>
</ul>

<h3>Legal Principles</h3>
<div class="golden-box">
<p><strong>Lex Talionis:</strong> The code famously established the principle of "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth"—
proportional justice where punishment matches the crime. However, this applied differently based on social class:</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
<li>If a noble injured another noble, the same injury was inflicted</li>
<li>If a noble injured a commoner, a fine was paid</li>
<li>If a commoner injured a noble, harsher penalties applied</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Notable Laws</h3>
<ul class="attribute-list">
<li><strong>Law 196:</strong> "If a man destroy the eye of another man, they shall destroy his eye."</li>
<li><strong>Law 229-230:</strong> If a builder's house collapses and kills the owner, the builder shall be put to death;
if it kills the owner's son, the builder's son shall be put to death (principle of equivalent compensation)</li>
<li><strong>Law 138:</strong> If a man wishes to divorce his wife who has not borne him children, he shall give her money
equivalent to her bride-price and shall make good to her the dowry which she brought from her father's house</li>
<li><strong>Law 215-225:</strong> Set fees for physicians and penalties if their treatment caused harm</li>
</ul>

<h3>Prologue and Epilogue</h3>
<p>
The Code begins with a lengthy prologue where <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Hammurabi" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../mythos/babylonian/corpus-search.html?term=hammurabi" title="Search corpus for 'Hammurabi'">Hammurabi</a> declares he was chosen by the gods "to bring about
the rule of righteousness in the land, to destroy the wicked and the evil-doers; so that the strong should not harm the
weak." The epilogue contains blessings for those who respect the laws and curses upon future rulers who deface or ignore
them, invoking various deities to punish violators.
</p>

<h2>Administration and Governance</h2>
<h3>Centralized Bureaucracy</h3>
<p>
<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Hammurabi" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../mythos/babylonian/corpus-search.html?term=hammurabi" title="Search corpus for 'Hammurabi'">Hammurabi</a> established an efficient centralized administration, personally involving himself in matters great and small.
Thousands of letters have been discovered showing his attention to detail in:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Judicial decisions and legal appeals</li>
<li>Canal maintenance and irrigation projects</li>
<li>Temple construction and religious festivals</li>
<li>Tax collection and resource allocation</li>
<li>Appointment of officials and governors</li>
</ul>

<h3>Economic Policies</h3>
<p>
Under Hammurabi's rule, Babylon flourished economically through:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Standardization of weights, measures, and commercial practices</li>
<li>Regulation of interest rates and debt forgiveness decrees</li>
<li>Protection of merchants and regulation of trade</li>
<li>Major irrigation projects that increased agricultural yields</li>
<li>Building projects that employed thousands and stimulated the economy</li>
</ul>

<h2>Religious Role</h2>
<h3>Champion of <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Marduk" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../mythos/babylonian/corpus-search.html?term=marduk" title="Search corpus for 'Marduk'">Marduk</a></h3>
<p>
<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Hammurabi" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../mythos/babylonian/corpus-search.html?term=hammurabi" title="Search corpus for 'Hammurabi'">Hammurabi</a> promoted <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Marduk" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../mythos/babylonian/corpus-search.html?term=marduk" title="Search corpus for 'Marduk'">Marduk</a> (patron deity of Babylon) to supremacy in the Mesopotamian pantheon. As Babylon
rose to political dominance, <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Marduk" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../mythos/babylonian/corpus-search.html?term=marduk" title="Search corpus for 'Marduk'">Marduk</a> displaced older gods like Enlil as king of the gods. This religious elevation
paralleled and legitimized Babylon's political ascendancy. <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Hammurabi" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../mythos/babylonian/corpus-search.html?term=hammurabi" title="Search corpus for 'Hammurabi'">Hammurabi</a> presented himself as <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Marduk" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../mythos/babylonian/corpus-search.html?term=marduk" title="Search corpus for 'Marduk'">Marduk</a>'s earthly
representative, chosen to establish divine order.
</p>

<h3>Temple Builder</h3>
<p>
<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Hammurabi" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../mythos/babylonian/corpus-search.html?term=hammurabi" title="Search corpus for 'Hammurabi'">Hammurabi</a> constructed and restored temples throughout his kingdom, including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The Esagila (temple of <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Marduk" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../mythos/babylonian/corpus-search.html?term=marduk" title="Search corpus for 'Marduk'">Marduk</a> in Babylon)</li>
<li>Temples to <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Shamash" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../mythos/babylonian/corpus-search.html?term=shamash" title="Search corpus for 'Shamash'">Shamash</a> (god of justice and the sun)</li>
<li>Shrines to <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Ishtar" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../mythos/babylonian/corpus-search.html?term=ishtar" title="Search corpus for 'Ishtar'">Ishtar</a>, <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Sin" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../mythos/babylonian/corpus-search.html?term=sin" title="Search corpus for 'Sin'">Sin</a>, and other deities</li>
</ul>
<p>
These building projects were both acts of piety and political statements, demonstrating Babylonian wealth and divine favor.
</p>

<h2>Legacy and Death</h2>
<h3>End of Reign</h3>
<p>
<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Hammurabi" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../mythos/babylonian/corpus-search.html?term=hammurabi" title="Search corpus for 'Hammurabi'">Hammurabi</a> died around 1750 BCE after a 42-year reign. He was succeeded by his son Samsu-iluna, who faced immediate
rebellions and invasions. The empire <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Hammurabi" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../mythos/babylonian/corpus-search.html?term=hammurabi" title="Search corpus for 'Hammurabi'">Hammurabi</a> built proved difficult to maintain, and southern Mesopotamia was lost

<h3>Divine Mandate</h3>
<p>
<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Hammurabi" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../mythos/babylonian/corpus-search.html?term=hammurabi" title="Search corpus for 'Hammurabi'">Hammurabi</a> presented himself not merely as a conqueror but as a divinely appointed shepherd of his people. The prologue
to his law code states: "When <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Marduk" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../mythos/babylonian/corpus-search.html?term=marduk" title="Search corpus for 'Marduk'">Marduk</a> sent me to rule the people and to bring help to the land, I established law
and justice in the language of the land and promoted the welfare of the people."
</p>

<h3>The Just King Archetype</h3>
<p>
<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Hammurabi" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../mythos/babylonian/corpus-search.html?term=hammurabi" title="Search corpus for 'Hammurabi'">Hammurabi</a> embodied the Mesopotamian ideal of the just king who:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Protects the weak from the strong</li>
<li>Ensures widows and orphans receive justice</li>
<li>Maintains irrigation systems for agricultural prosperity</li>
<li>Defends the realm from enemies</li>
<li>Honors the gods through temple construction and proper rituals</li>
</ul>
