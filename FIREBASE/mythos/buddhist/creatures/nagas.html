<h2>Nagas (नाग / ཀླུ།)</h2>
<p class="subtitle" style="font-size: var(--font-size-2xl); margin: 0.5rem 0;">Serpent Deities, Guardians of Waters and Wisdom</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-top: var(--spacing-md);">
                Nagas are semi-divine serpent beings who inhabit underwater realms, lakes, rivers, and springs. In Buddhist
                cosmology, they possess great magical power, vast treasures, and the ability to control weather, especially
                rain. While they can be benevolent protectors of the <a class="inline-search-link" href="../deities/gautama_buddha.html">Buddha's</a>
                teachings and guardians of sacred texts, they can also be wrathful when disrespected, bringing drought, floods,
                or disease. They represent the primal forces of nature—powerful, necessary, but potentially dangerous if not
                honored properly.

<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
<li><strong>Full Serpent Form:</strong> Massive multi-headed cobras, often with 5, 7, or 9 heads representing
                    magical power. Can be hundreds of feet long.</li>

                    spreading from shoulders</li>
<li><strong>Human Form:</strong> Appear as beautiful men or women, though often betrayed by some snake-like
                    feature (forked tongue, jewel on forehead, snake shadow)</li>
<li><strong>Hybrid Forms:</strong> Various combinations including human bodies with multiple snake heads
                    emerging from shoulders</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">Magical Powers</h3>
<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">

<li><strong>Shape-shifting:</strong> Transform between serpent, semi-human, and human forms at will</li>
<li><strong>Treasure Guardianship:</strong> Possess and protect vast hoards of jewels, gold, and sacred objects</li>
<li><strong>Venom:</strong> Deadly poison breath or bite that can kill instantly or cause disease</li>
<li><strong>Longevity:</strong> Live for thousands of years, witnessing ages pass</li>
<li><strong>Size Alteration:</strong> Shrink to human size or expand to mountain-filling proportions</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">Dwelling Places</h3>
<p>Nagas inhabit liminal aquatic spaces:</p>
<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
<li>Underwater palaces in oceans, lakes, and rivers made of crystal, coral, and jewels</li>
<li>Springs, wells, and sacred bathing pools</li>
<li>The roots of great trees near water</li>
<li>Caves behind waterfalls</li>

                        "In a former life, the Bodhisattva was born as Bhuridatta, a naga prince. To accumulate merit, he would take human form and observe the precepts. Each fortnight he would lie on an anthill in serpent form, vowing not to move even if attacked, as an exercise in perfect patience. A snake charmer captured him and forced him to perform for crowds. Though possessing the power to kill his captor with a breath, Bhuridatta endured humiliation to maintain his vow. Eventually a prince recognized his noble nature and freed him. This tale teaches that even nagas—powerful, wrathful beings—can practice perfect virtue."

<h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary);">Mucalinda - <a class="inline-search-link" href="../deities/gautama_buddha.html">The Buddha</a>'s Protector</h3>
<p>
                The most famous naga in Buddhism protected the newly-enlightened Buddha from a great storm by coiling around
                him seven times and spreading his hood overhead for seven days. This image—Buddha in meditation posture with
                cobra hood canopy—is one of the most iconic in Buddhist art. Mucalinda represents nature's reverence for
                enlightenment.
            </p>
<h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">Sagara (Ocean) - Father of the Dragon Princess</h3>
<p>
                King of all nagas dwelling in the ocean depths, Sagara's eight-year-old daughter achieved instant enlightenment
                in the <em>Lotus Sutra</em>, demonstrating that even beings in non-human realms (and female forms) could swiftly
                attain Buddhahood. This challenged traditional views and supported Mahayana universalism.
            </p>
<h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">Anavatapta (Unheated Lake)</h3>
<p>
                Ruler of the legendary lake Anavatapta (modern Lake Manasarovar in Tibet), from which the four great rivers
                of India were believed to flow. His realm is described as a pure land where illness cannot exist and the
                temperature is always perfect. Great sages would visit his palace to receive teachings.
            </p>
<h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">Nanda and Upananda - Brother Nagas</h3>
<p>
                Twin naga kings who attended <a class="inline-search-link" href="../deities/gautama_buddha.html">the Buddha</a>'s birth, causing miraculous streams of hot and cold water to appear
                for bathing the infant bodhisattva. They represent the balancing of complementary forces.
            </p>
<h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">Elapatra - The Reformer</h3>
<p>
                A naga who heard <a class="inline-search-link" href="../deities/gautama_buddha.html">the Buddha</a> preach and experienced deep regret for his past wrathful actions. He became so
                devoted to Dharma that <a class="inline-search-link" href="../deities/gautama_buddha.html">the Buddha</a> predicted he would be reborn human in his next life and eventually become
                a <em>pratyekabuddha</em> (solitary buddha). His story demonstrates that even those who've committed terrible
                acts can transform through sincere practice.

<h2 style="color: var(--color-primary);">The Eight Great Naga Kings</h2>
<p>
                Tantric Buddhism identifies eight principal naga rulers who protect the Dharma:
            </p>
<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
<li><strong>Nanda:</strong> Joy, rules eastern waters</li>
<li><strong>Upananda:</strong> Little Joy, rules southern waters</li>
<li><strong>Sagara:</strong> Ocean, rules all seas</li>
<li><strong>Vasuki:</strong> Excellent, king of snakes (used in churning cosmic ocean)</li>
<li><strong>Takshaka:</strong> Swift, rules northern waters (most wrathful)</li>
<li><strong>Anavatapta:</strong> Unheated, rules perfect lake in Himalayas</li>
<li><strong>Manasvin:</strong> Thoughtful, rules western waters</li>
<li><strong>Utpalaka:</strong> Lotus-colored, rules underground waters</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top: var(--spacing-md);">
                These eight are invoked in protection rituals, weather ceremonies, and agricultural blessings. Each has
                distinct personality and preferred offerings.

<h2 style="color: var(--color-primary);">Naga Afflictions and Remedies</h2>

<li>Mental disturbances and nightmares featuring snakes</li>

<p>Traditional remedies include:</p>

<li><strong>Vase Rituals (bum pa):</strong> Elaborate ceremonies with consecrated vases buried near water sources</li>
<li><strong>Environmental Restoration:</strong> Cleaning polluted waters, protecting wetlands</li>
<li><strong>Recitation:</strong> Naga-specific mantras and dharanis for protection and healing</li>
