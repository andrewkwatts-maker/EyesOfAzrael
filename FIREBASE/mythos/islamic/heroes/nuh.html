<h2>Nuh - The Patient Prophet</h2>
<p>
<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Nuh" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../mythos/islamic/index.html" title="Search corpus for 'Nuh'">Nuh</a> (Noah) is one of the five greatest prophets in Islam (ulul-azm, those of great resolve), sent to humanity to call
them to the worship of Allah alone. He preached for 950 years, enduring constant rejection, mockery, and persecution from
his people before Allah commanded him to build the Ark and saved only the believers from the Great Flood. His story,
mentioned in multiple chapters of the Quran including an entire surah named after him (Surah Nuh), exemplifies patience,
perseverance, and unwavering faith in the face of overwhelming opposition.
</p>

<h2>The Mission</h2>
<h3>Call to Monotheism</h3>
<p>
<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Nuh" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../mythos/islamic/index.html" title="Search corpus for 'Nuh'">Nuh</a>'s people had fallen into idolatry, worshiping false gods including Wadd, Suwa, Yaghuth, Ya'uq, and Nasr. These were
originally righteous men who died, but Shaytan (Satan) deceived subsequent generations into making images of them for
remembrance, which eventually became objects of worship. <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Nuh" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../mythos/islamic/index.html" title="Search corpus for 'Nuh'">Nuh</a> was sent as a warner to call them back to tawhid (pure
monotheism)—the worship of Allah alone.
</p>

<h3>950 Years of Preaching</h3>
<p>
The Quran describes <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Nuh" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../mythos/islamic/index.html" title="Search corpus for 'Nuh'">Nuh</a> calling his people day and night, publicly and privately, openly and in secret. He used every
method of persuasion:
</p>
<ul>
<li>He reminded them of Allah's blessings—rain, crops, children, gardens</li>
<li>He warned them of punishment in the Hereafter</li>
<li>He appealed to their reason, pointing out Allah's creation of the heavens, earth, and moon</li>
<li>He promised them forgiveness and increase in wealth and children if they repented</li>
<li>He never asked for payment, seeking only Allah's reward</li>
</ul>

<p>
Despite 950 years of tireless effort, only a few believed—according to tradition, perhaps 80 people total. The wealthy and
powerful were the most hostile, mocking him as a madman and threatening to stone him. They accused him of being merely a
human (how could a human be a prophet?) and of seeking worldly gain. The elders commanded their children never to abandon
their idols, ensuring the perpetuation of disbelief.
</p>

<h2>The Divine Command</h2>
<h3>Building the Ark</h3>
<p>
When <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Nuh" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../mythos/islamic/index.html" title="Search corpus for 'Nuh'">Nuh</a> despaired of their repentance, he prayed: "My Lord, do not leave upon the earth any inhabitant from among the
disbelievers. Indeed, if You leave them, they will mislead Your servants and not beget except [every] wicked one and
[confirmed] disbeliever" (Quran 71:26-27). Allah answered his prayer and commanded him to build an ark under divine
inspiration.
</p>

<p>
<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Nuh" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../mythos/islamic/index.html" title="Search corpus for 'Nuh'">Nuh</a> began constructing the massive ship far from any body of water. His people mocked him mercilessly: "You claim to be a
prophet, yet you've become a carpenter!" He replied, "If you mock us, we will mock you as you mock. You will come to know
who will receive a humiliating punishment and upon whom will descend an enduring punishment."
</p>

<h3>The Command to Board</h3>
<p>
When the Ark was complete, Allah commanded <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Nuh" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../mythos/islamic/index.html" title="Search corpus for 'Nuh'">Nuh</a>: "Embark in it, of each [creature] two mates, and your family, except those
about whom the word has preceded, and [include] whoever has believed." The believers—few in number—boarded, along with a
pair of every animal species to preserve life on earth.
</p>

<h2>The Great Flood</h2>
<h3>The Waters Rise</h3>
<p>
The Quran describes how the "oven burst forth" (water gushing from the earth) and torrential rain fell from the sky. Water
came from above and below, covering the entire earth. The waves towered like mountains. <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Nuh" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../mythos/islamic/index.html" title="Search corpus for 'Nuh'">Nuh</a>'s Ark sailed through the
raging flood while those who rejected Allah's message drowned.
</p>

<h3>The Tragedy of Nuh's Son</h3>
<p>
One of <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Nuh" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../mythos/islamic/index.html" title="Search corpus for 'Nuh'">Nuh</a>'s sons (name not mentioned in the Quran, but traditional sources call him Yam or Canaan) refused to
board the Ark, believing he could escape to a mountain. <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Nuh" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../mythos/islamic/index.html" title="Search corpus for 'Nuh'">Nuh</a> called out to him: "O my son, come aboard with us and be not
with the disbelievers!" The son replied arrogantly, "I will take refuge on a mountain to protect me from the water." <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Nuh" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../mythos/islamic/index.html" title="Search corpus for 'Nuh'">Nuh</a>
warned, "There is no protector today from Allah's decree except for whom He gives mercy." A wave came between them, and the
son was drowned.
</p>

<p>
Heartbroken, <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Nuh" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../mythos/islamic/index.html" title="Search corpus for 'Nuh'">Nuh</a> cried out to Allah, "My Lord, indeed my son is of my family!" Allah gently corrected him: "O Noah,
indeed he is not of your family; indeed, he is [one whose] work was other than righteous." This teaches that true family
in Islam is based on faith, not mere blood relation. <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Nuh" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../mythos/islamic/index.html" title="Search corpus for 'Nuh'">Nuh</a> immediately submitted: "My Lord, I seek refuge in You from
asking that of which I have no knowledge."
</p>

<h2>After the Flood</h2>
<h3>Landing on Mount Judi</h3>
<p>
When Allah's decree was fulfilled, He commanded: "O earth, swallow your water, and O sky, withhold [your rain]." The water
receded, and the Ark settled on Mount Judi (identified with mountains in present-day Turkey or Kurdistan). <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Nuh" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../mythos/islamic/index.html" title="Search corpus for 'Nuh'">Nuh</a> and the
believers disembarked, and Allah blessed them: "O Noah, disembark in security from Us and blessings upon you and upon
nations [descending] from those with you."
</p>

<h3>Covenant and Promise</h3>
<p>
Islamic tradition teaches that all humanity descends from the believers who survived with <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Nuh" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../mythos/islamic/index.html" title="Search corpus for 'Nuh'">Nuh</a>—making him a second
father of mankind after Adam. Allah established a covenant never to destroy the earth by flood again. <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Nuh" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../mythos/islamic/index.html" title="Search corpus for 'Nuh'">Nuh</a> lived many
more years after the flood, continuing to worship Allah and teach the survivors.
</p>

<h2>Lessons from Nuh's Story</h2>
<p>
The story of <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Nuh" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../mythos/islamic/index.html" title="Search corpus for 'Nuh'">Nuh</a> teaches Muslims profound lessons:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Patience in Da'wah:</strong> <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Nuh" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../mythos/islamic/index.html" title="Search corpus for 'Nuh'">Nuh</a> preached for 950 years without losing hope, exemplifying patient perseverance</li>
<li><strong>Sincerity:</strong> He never asked for payment or worldly benefit, seeking only Allah's pleasure</li>
<li><strong>Reliance on Allah:</strong> When people threatened him, he trusted Allah's protection</li>
<li><strong>Obedience:</strong> He built the Ark despite mockery, trusting Allah's wisdom</li>
<li><strong>Faith over Family:</strong> Blood relations mean nothing without shared faith</li>
<li><strong>Divine Justice:</strong> Allah gave the people 950 years to repent—His punishment comes only after
ample warning and opportunity</li>
<li><strong>Futility of Worldly Power:</strong> Wealth, status, and mountains cannot save one from Allah's decree</li>
</ul>

<h2>Significance in Islam</h2>
<p>
<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Nuh" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../mythos/islamic/index.html" title="Search corpus for 'Nuh'">Nuh</a> is mentioned 43 times in the Quran and is considered one of the ulul-azm (prophets of great resolve), alongside
Ibrahim (Abraham), Musa (Moses), <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Isa" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../mythos/islamic/index.html" title="Search corpus for 'Isa'">Isa</a> (Jesus), and Muhammad. He is the first messenger sent to warn humanity after the
time of Adam. His steadfastness despite nearly a millennium of rejection makes him a model for Muslims facing opposition.
The flood serves as a warning of Allah's power and the certainty of judgment for those who reject His message.
</p>

<p>
Prophet Muhammad said: "On the Day of Resurrection, the people will come to Noah and say, 'You are the first of the
messengers to the people of the earth, and Allah named you a grateful servant.'" This title—"grateful servant" (abd
shakur)—captures <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Nuh" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../mythos/islamic/index.html" title="Search corpus for 'Nuh'">Nuh</a>'s essential character: despite trials, he remained thankful to Allah, patient, and obedient.
