The journey involves crossing treacherous rivers, facing judgment, and eternal residence\n                in one of several realms based on one's life. Unlike many traditions, most souls face neither eternal bliss\n                nor torment, but rather a dim existence in the Asphodel Meadows.",

      "description": "Sumerian creation mythology describes the emergence of order from the primordial sea and the\n                establishment of cosmic structure through divine action. Unlike creation ex nihilo (from nothing),\n                Sumerian creation is the organization of pre-existing chaotic matter. The gods themselves emerge\n                from nature, then shape it. Humanity is created not as beloved children but as laborers to serve\n                the gods and maintain the cosmic order.",
