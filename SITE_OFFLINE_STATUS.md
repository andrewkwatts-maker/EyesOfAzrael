## Current Visitor Experience

When someone visits **www.eyesofazrael.com**, they will see:

### 👁️ Eyes of Azrael
**Mythology, Physics & Esoteric Knowledge**

### ⚠️ SITE TEMPORARILY OFFLINE

**Message:**
> The Eyes of Azrael website is currently offline for maintenance and content review.

**What's Happening:**
- All theory pages have been enhanced with comprehensive intellectual honesty warnings
- Content is being reviewed for accuracy and proper framing
- Speculative material is being clearly labeled as thought experiments, not factual claims
- The site will return with improved critical thinking frameworks

**Recent Updates:**
- Added "Reality Check" warnings to all correlation claims
- Implemented correlation rating system (⭐⭐⭐ Strong to ⭐ Weak)
- Removed weakest correlations (e.g., Wu Xing 5-forces mapping)
- Emphasized parsimonious explanations (mathematical universality, confirmation bias)
- Positioned content as "intellectual entertainment" and "pattern exploration"

**Expected Return:**
- Timeline: To be determined pending final content review
- GitHub Repository: https://github.com/andrewkwatts-maker/EyesOfAzrael
- All code and content remains publicly accessible on GitHub

3. **Git History:**

## Why Offline?

The site was taken offline to allow for:

1. **Content Review** - Final assessment of all theory page claims
2. **Quality Control** - Ensuring intellectual honesty enhancements are sufficient
3. **Risk Mitigation** - Preventing potential misinterpretation of speculative content
4. **Professional Presentation** - Better than having unfinished/problematic content live

- Can update maintenance page with new timeline/information as needed

### If You Want to Restore Site:
- Follow one of the restoration options above
- Consider which version to restore (with or without intellectual honesty updates)
- The enhanced theory pages are significantly more defensible than originals

### If You Want to Update Maintenance Page:
- Edit `index.html` with new information
- Commit and push changes

## Recommendation

Given that we just completed comprehensive intellectual honesty enhancements, the **enhanced theory pages are now much more defensible** than before. Consider:

1. **Keep offline short-term** (1-3 days) for final review
2. **Restore with enhanced pages** - They're significantly improved
3. **Monitor feedback** - The new warnings should prevent most criticism

The enhanced pages demonstrate:
- ✅ Maximum intellectual honesty
- ✅ Clear skeptical framing
- ✅ Honest correlation ratings
- ✅ Parsimonious alternative explanations
- ✅ "Thought experiment" positioning

These improvements make the site much more professionally defensible.
