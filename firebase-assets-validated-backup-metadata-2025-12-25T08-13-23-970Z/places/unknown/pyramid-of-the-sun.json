Standing approximately 66 meters (216 feet) high with a base\n                measuring 225 by 222 meters, it dominates the cityscape along the famous Avenue of the Dead. Built around\n                100 CE, the pyramid was constructed over a sacred cave that was likely a pilgrimage site for centuries before\n                the city's founding. The Teotihuacanos considered this cave a place of origin - where humanity emerged from\n                the underworld and where the sun and moon were born.",
