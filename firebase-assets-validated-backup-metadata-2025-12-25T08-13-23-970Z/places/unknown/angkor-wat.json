Built in the early 12th century (1113-1150 CE)\n                by Khmer King Suryavarman II, it was originally constructed as a Hindu temple dedicated to Vishnu, but\n                gradually transformed into a Buddhist temple by the end of the 12th century. The temple complex represents\n                the pinnacle of classical Khmer architecture and has become a symbol of Cambodia, appearing on the national\n                flag and serving as the country's prime tourist attraction.",
