  "longDescription": "The rosary is a string of prayer beads used primarily in Roman Catholic devotion, serving as both a counting device for prayers and a physical aid to meditation. A standard rosary consists of five decades (groups of ten beads), separated by single beads, attached to a shorter strand containing a crucifix and additional beads. The complete object forms a loop with a pendant section, designed to be held and manipulated during prayer.",
