Magatama are comma-shaped or curved beads that have been found in Japan dating back to prehistoric times, often made of jade, agate, or quartz.

It was given to Ninigi when he descended from Takamagahara and has been passed down through the Imperial line. The jewel is currently kept in the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, in the Sword and Jewel Sanctuaries. Like the other regalia, it has never been publicly displayed, and its exact appearance, size, and material composition remain uncertain.",
