  "description": "The six realms of existence (Sanskrit: gati or bhava) are the destinations for rebirth in Buddhist cosmology, depicted in the Bhavachakra (Wheel of Becoming). These realms are driven by karma—the consequences of intentional actions—and the three root poisons: greed, hatred, and ignorance."
