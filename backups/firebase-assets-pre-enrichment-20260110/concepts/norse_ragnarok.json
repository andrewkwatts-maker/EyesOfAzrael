  "typologicalReading": "Ragnarok represents the Norse peoples' natural eschatological awareness - the intuition that history is moving toward a cataclysmic confrontation between order and chaos, followed by renewal. The structural parallels with Christian apocalyptic (cosmic signs, fire destruction, final battle, new creation) suggest a common human apprehension of eschatological truth. However, the crucial difference lies in the nature of divinity: Norse gods die at Ragnarok, subject to fate; the Christian God is eternal, victorious, and raises the dead. Where Ragnarok offers cyclical renewal, Christianity proclaims irreversible victory: 'Death is swallowed up in victory' (1 Corinthians 15:54). Medieval missionaries could present Christian eschatology as the fulfillment of what Norse myth anticipated - not endless cycles but final consummation in Christ.",
