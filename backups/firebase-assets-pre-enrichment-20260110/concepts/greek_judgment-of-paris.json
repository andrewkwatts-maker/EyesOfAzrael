    "temptationPattern": "The three offers - power (Hera), wisdom (Athena), pleasure (Aphrodite) - mirror the threefold temptation of Christ (Matthew 4:1-11) and 1 John 2:16's 'lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, pride of life'",

      "temptationOfChrist": "Where Paris succumbed to the offer of worldly pleasure, Christ rejected all three temptations - bread (flesh), glory (eyes), kingdoms (pride of life)",
      "wisdomRejected": "Paris's rejection of Athena's wisdom parallels those who 'did not see fit to acknowledge God' and 'exchanged the truth about God for a lie' (Romans 1:21-25)",
      "beautyAsIdol": "Choosing Aphrodite represents idolatry of created beauty over the Creator - 'they worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator' (Romans 1:25)",
      "consequentialChoice": "The Trojan War's destruction from one bad choice illustrates how 'sin when it is fully grown brings forth death' (James 1:15)",

    "justinMartyr": "Justin noted that Greek mythology's tales of divine immorality show why paganism failed to produce true virtue, unlike the holy God of Scripture",
    "augustine": "Augustine's 'City of God' extensively critiques the immoral Greek gods, including the divine vanity displayed in the Paris judgment",

  "typologicalReading": "The Judgment of Paris serves as a negative type illustrating fallen humanity's tendency to choose sensual pleasure over wisdom and justice. Where Paris chose Aphrodite and brought destruction, Christ faced similar temptations and chose the Father's will, bringing salvation. The myth exposes the inadequacy of pagan religion's gods - petty, jealous, bribing mortals - and points by contrast to the holy God of Israel whose covenant love offers freely without manipulation.",
