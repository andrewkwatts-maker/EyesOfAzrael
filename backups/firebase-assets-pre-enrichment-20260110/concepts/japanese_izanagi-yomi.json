After his beloved wife Izanami dies giving birth to the fire god, Izanagi descends to the underworld realm of Yomi to retrieve her. His journey reveals the absolute boundary between life and death—once crossed, it cannot be undone without terrible consequences.",

      "failedRescue": "Like Orpheus, Izanagi's failed rescue of his spouse points to humanity's inability to conquer death through its own power - requiring a divine Savior",

  "typologicalReading": "Izanagi's journey to Yomi represents humanity's universal but futile attempt to overcome death through its own efforts. The prohibition against looking, the corruption of the beloved's body, and the necessity of purification all point to deep truths that find their resolution only in Christ. Where Izanagi fails and flees, sealing the realm of the dead with a boulder, Christ descends victoriously and rises again, rolling away the stone. The misogi purification ritual anticipates the Christian sacrament of baptism, where believers are truly cleansed from death's power and united to the Risen Lord. What Shinto recognizes as permanent separation in death, Christianity proclaims as overcome: 'O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?' (1 Corinthians 15:55).",
