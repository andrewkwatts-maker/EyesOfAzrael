  "description": "The Descent of Inanna is one of the oldest recorded myths in human history, preserved on cuneiform tablets from ancient Sumer. The goddess Inanna, Queen of Heaven and Earth, descends to the underworld realm of Kur to visit her sister Ereshkigal, Queen of the Dead. At each of seven gates, she is stripped of her divine powers and regalia, arriving naked and powerless before the throne of death itself.",

  "typologicalReading": "The Descent of Inanna represents humanity's most ancient literary expression of the hope that a divine figure can enter the realm of death and return victorious. The structural parallels with Christ's descent are striking: the willing entry into death's realm, the stripping away of divine glory (kenosis), three days of death, revival by life-giving sustenance, and triumphant return. However, crucial differences illuminate Christian distinctives: Inanna descends for ambiguous purposes, perhaps to extend her power, while Christ descends out of love to free captives; the substitute Dumuzi is unwilling and condemned, while Christ is the willing substitute who takes our place. The Church Fathers understood pagan myths as shadows pointing toward the substance in Christ. Inanna's descent is thus a profound preparatio evangelica - the human longing for divine victory over death that finds its fulfillment when Christ 'descended into the lower regions of the earth' (Ephesians 4:9) and rose victorious.",
