  "description": "The most revolutionary claim of Gnostic Christianity: the god of the Old Testament - the creator of the material world,\n                the lawgiver of Sinai, the jealous deity demanding worship - is not the supreme God. That is\n                Yaldabaoth, the Demiurge, the ignorant craftsman born from\n                Sophia's defective emanation. Above him, beyond all the archontic spheres,\n                dwelling in ineffable light and perfect silence, is the Monad - the true Father revealed by\n                Christ. This is the distinction between the god of this world and the\n                God of eternity, between the ruler of matter and the source of spirit, between law and grace, judgment and love,\n                fear and gnosis. Understanding this difference is the key to spiritual liberation.",
