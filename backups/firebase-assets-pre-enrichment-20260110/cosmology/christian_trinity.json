This doctrine, developed through centuries of theological reflection on Scripture and defined at the Councils of Nicaea (325) and Constantinople (381), distinguishes Christianity from all other monotheistic faiths while affirming the absolute oneness of God.",

  "theologicalSignificance": "The Trinity is not merely an abstract doctrine but the foundation of Christian life and worship. It reveals that God is not solitary but eternally relational - a communion of love into which believers are invited through Christ in the Spirit. Trinitarian theology shapes Christian understanding of salvation (the Father's plan, accomplished by the Son, applied by the Spirit), the Church (icon of trinitarian communion), and the human person (made for relationship, bearing the image of the Triune God).",
