  "description": "Grace (from Latin gratia, Greek charis) is the fundamental principle of God's dealings with humanity in Christian theology. It represents God's free and unmerited favor—His kindness toward those who deserve punishment, His love toward those who are unlovely, His mercy toward those who are guilty. Grace is not something God owes to humanity; it flows from His own character as a loving, compassionate, and merciful God.",
