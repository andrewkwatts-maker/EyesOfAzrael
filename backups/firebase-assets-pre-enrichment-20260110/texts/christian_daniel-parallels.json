  "description": "The Daniel-Revelation parallels represent one of the most significant intertextual connections in biblical prophecy. Daniel's visions of four beast kingdoms, the Son of Man coming on clouds to receive dominion, the little horn speaking blasphemies, and time prophecies (time, times, half a time) form the foundational framework that John extensively adapts in Revelation. The composite beast of Revelation 13 combines all four of Daniel's beasts; the Son of Man imagery runs throughout Revelation; the 42-month period appears repeatedly. Understanding Daniel is essential to interpreting Revelation.",
  "longDescription": "The Book of Daniel provides the primary Old Testament framework for Revelation's apocalyptic symbolism. Key parallels include:\n\nThe Four Beasts and the Composite Beast:\nDaniel 7 presents four beasts rising from the sea: a lion with eagle's wings (Babylon), a bear (Persia), a four-headed leopard (Greece), and a terrifying fourth beast with iron teeth and ten horns (Rome). Revelation 13:1-2 combines all four: 'The beast I saw resembled a leopard, but had feet like those of a bear and a mouth like that of a lion.' John's composite beast concentrates all previous imperial power into one end-time entity.\n\nThe Son of Man:\nDaniel 7:13-14 presents 'one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven,' who approaches the Ancient of Days and receives 'authority, glory and sovereign power.' This foundational Christological title appears throughout Revelation: Christ's self-identification (1:13; 14:14), the cloud coming (1:7), and the reception of kingdom power (11:15).\n\nThe Little Horn:\nDaniel 7:8, 24-25 describes a 'little horn' arising among the ten, speaking 'boastfully,' waging war against the saints for 'a time, times and half a time.' Revelation's beast similarly has 'a mouth to utter proud words and blasphemies' and authority 'for forty-two months' (13:5-7).\n\nTime Prophecies:\nDaniel's 'time, times and half a time' (7:25; 12:7) appears in Revelation as 42 months (11:2; 13:5), 1,260 days (11:3; 12:6), and 'a time, times, and half a time' (12:14). This 3.5-year period structures Revelation's tribulation narrative.\n\nThe Ancient of Days and the Throne:\nDaniel 7:9-10's throne vision - with fire, wheels, and opened books - informs Revelation 4-5's heavenly throne room and 20:11-12's Great White Throne judgment.\n\nThe Resurrection:\nDaniel 12:2 - 'Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt' - provides background for Revelation's first and second resurrections (20:4-6, 12-15).",
  "historicalContext": "Daniel was likely composed during the Maccabean crisis (167-164 BCE), addressing persecution under Antiochus IV Epiphanes through the literary device of Babylonian exile prophecy. The four kingdoms are typically identified as Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome (or a Greek sub-kingdom). The book established the apocalyptic literary genre that Jewish writers developed through the intertestamental period.\n\nJohn, writing in the 90s CE, inherited this developed tradition. His Roman audience would recognize the fourth beast as their own empire. The connection between Daniel and Revelation was recognized from the earliest church: Hippolytus (c. 200 CE) wrote commentaries on both, treating them as a continuous prophetic tradition.\n\nThe textual traditions of both books are complex. Daniel exists in Hebrew/Aramaic and expanded Greek versions (LXX, Theodotion). Revelation's manuscripts show remarkable stability. John's Greek follows the tradition of Daniel-Theodotion rather than the LXX, suggesting he used a Greek text close to the later standard.",
  "theologicalSignificance": "The Daniel-Revelation connection establishes crucial theological principles:\n\n1. Prophetic Continuity: Revelation fulfills and expands Daniel's visions, demonstrating God's consistent prophetic purpose across centuries.\n\n2. Christological Climax: Daniel's 'son of man' who receives the kingdom finds full identification with Jesus Christ, who has conquered through death and resurrection.\n\n3. Imperial Critique: Both books present human empires as beastly powers opposing God. Political power divorced from divine accountability becomes demonic.\n\n4. Saints' Vindication: Both promise that the 'holy ones' (Daniel) or 'saints' (Revelation), though persecuted for a limited time, will ultimately receive the kingdom.\n\n5. Resurrection Hope: Daniel's resurrection vision grounds Revelation's more developed two-resurrection scheme.\n\n6. Divine Sovereignty: Despite apparent chaos, God's predetermined times (70 weeks, 3.5 years) govern history's course toward his determined end.",

  "comparativeNotes": {
    "jewishApocalyptic": "The intertestamental period produced extensive Daniel interpretation. 1 Enoch develops the Son of Man tradition. 4 Ezra reinterprets the four kingdoms. The Qumran community produced Daniel commentaries (pesharim). This interpretive tradition informed John's reading.",
    "earlyChurchReception": "From Irenaeus onward, the church read Daniel and Revelation as complementary prophecies. The four-kingdom scheme identified Rome as the fourth beast, leading to expectations of Rome's fall and Christ's return. This shaped Christian political theology for centuries.",
    "hermeneuticalImplications": "The Daniel-Revelation connection demonstrates typological fulfillment: Daniel's prophecies find partial fulfillment in Antiochus IV and more complete fulfillment in Rome, while pointing toward ultimate eschatological realization. Multiple fulfillments of prophetic patterns characterize apocalyptic literature."
