    "christian": {
      "overview": "The multi-headed Hydra presents striking parallels to biblical imagery of sea monsters and the dragon of Revelation. Early Church Fathers saw in such creatures symbols of sin's regenerating nature and Satan's manifold deceptions.",

      "medievalSymbolism": {
        "bestiaryMeaning": "Medieval bestiaries interpreted the Hydra as representing sin's persistent nature - cut off one vice and others emerge unless the root (the immortal head) is destroyed by divine grace.",
        "moralLesson": "The cauterizing fire needed to stop regeneration was seen as prefiguring baptismal purification or the refining fire of the Holy Spirit.",
        "artisticRepresentation": "Often depicted in manuscript marginalia alongside depictions of vice, particularly the seven deadly sins corresponding to the beast's heads."
      },
      "typologicalReading": "The Hydra narrative prefigures Christ's ultimate victory over Satan - just as Heracles required divine assistance (the immortal head buried under a rock), humanity requires Christ to finally defeat the serpent whose head was 'bruised' at Calvary (Genesis 3:15).",
