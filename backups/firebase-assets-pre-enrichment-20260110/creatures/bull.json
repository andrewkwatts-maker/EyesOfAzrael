      "typologicalReading": "The sacrificial bull of the Temple cult finds its fulfillment in Christ, the true sacrifice (Hebrews 9-10). The ox that knows its master prefigures the faithful who recognize Christ as Lord.",
      "contrastWithGoldenCalf": "The idolatrous Golden Calf (Exodus 32) stands as the negative counterpart to proper bovine symbolism - worship misdirected toward the creature rather than the Creator.",
      "liturgicalPresence": "The ox appears in Nativity scenes, Gospel book covers (as Luke's symbol), and church architecture, representing the sacrificial and servile aspects of Christian discipleship.",
      "agriculturalMetaphor": "Christ's statement \"Take my yoke upon you\" (Matthew 11:29) draws on ox imagery, presenting discipleship as shared labor with the divine farmer.",
