        "bestiaryMeaning": "Bestiaries taught that the eagle tests its young by making them gaze at the sun, raising those who can do so and rejecting those who cannot - interpreted as God testing believers' faith through trial.",
        "evangelistSymbol": "The eagle represents John the Evangelist (in the standard Western scheme), whose Gospel soars to the highest theological heights, beginning with the Logos.",
        "artisticRepresentation": "Eagle lecterns in churches symbolize the Gospel spreading on wings of inspiration; the eagle supports the Word because John's Gospel is read from the highest vantage.",
        "renewalLegend": "Medieval tradition held that aged eagles flew into the sun's fire, singed their old feathers, then plunged into water to emerge renewed - an elaborate baptismal allegory."
      },
      "typologicalReading": "The eagle's flight toward the sun and renewal through fire and water prefigures the Christian journey: ascending through prayer, purified by divine fire, renewed through baptismal waters, and finally rising to gaze upon the Light of God.",
      "liturgicalPresence": "Eagle symbols pervade church architecture (lecterns, capitals, windows), representing the Gospel's ability to soar above earthly confusion and bring divine perspective.",
      "spiritualAscent": "The eagle's flight became a central metaphor for mystical theology: the soul ascending through contemplative stages to direct vision of God (as the eagle gazes unflinching at the sun).",
