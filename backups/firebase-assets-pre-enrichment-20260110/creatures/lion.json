        "bestiaryMeaning": "Medieval bestiaries detailed three \"natures\" of the lion, all applied to Christ: (1) erasing tracks with tail (hiding divine nature), (2) sleeping with eyes open (death with divine vigilance), (3) breathing life into stillborn cubs (resurrection).",
        "evangelistSymbol": "The lion represents the Gospel of Mark (or in some schemes, John), symbolizing Christ's royal dignity and power over death.",
        "artisticRepresentation": "Lions guard cathedral entrances (especially in Romanesque architecture), representing Christ's protection and the courage required to enter sacred space.",
        "heraldry": "The lion became the preeminent symbol of Christian kingship, representing courage, justice, and Christ-like sovereignty."
      },
      "typologicalReading": "Daniel among the lions prefigures the Harrowing of Hell: as Daniel was preserved in the lions' den and emerged on the third day at royal command, so Christ descended among the powers of death and rose victorious.",
      "dualSymbolism": "The lion's dual use (Christ and Satan) teaches that symbols derive meaning from context: the same power that protects the faithful terrorizes God's enemies; the same ferocity that characterizes evil can be transformed into divine majesty.",
      "liturgicalPresence": "Lion imagery appears in Christian liturgy through the reading of Revelation 5:5 (Lion of Judah) and in prayers invoking protection from spiritual predators (1 Peter 5:8-9).",
