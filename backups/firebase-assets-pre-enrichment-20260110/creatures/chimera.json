        "bestiaryMeaning": "Medieval bestiaries used the Chimera as an example of impossibility and deception - its existence was sometimes denied, seen as a figure for lies that seem real.",
        "moralLesson": "The Chimera teaches that sin creates monsters within us - unnatural fusions of conflicting desires that can only be slain by the hero of virtue mounted on the divine Pegasus of grace.",
        "artisticRepresentation": "Gothic cathedral sculptures often included chimeric creatures in portrayals of hell and damnation, representing the monstrous transformations wrought by sin."
      },
      "typologicalReading": "Bellerophon's aerial defeat of the Chimera (attacking from above, out of reach of the fire) prefigures Christ's victory from the Cross - striking at sin from a position (the Cross/throne) that sin cannot reach.",
