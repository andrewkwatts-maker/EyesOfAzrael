  "content": "# Seraphim (Burning Ones)\n\n## The Throne Vision of Isaiah\n\n'In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple. Above him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. And one called to another and said: Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory! And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.' (Isaiah 6:1-4)\n\n## The Six Wings Symbolism\n\n**Two covering the face**: Even the highest angels cannot gaze upon the full glory of God; they cover their faces in reverent awe.\n\n**Two covering the feet**: The 'feet' is often a Hebrew euphemism; the covering represents humility and modesty before divine holiness.\n\n**Two for flying**: Ready to execute God's will with speed and obedience.\n\n## The Trisagion (Thrice-Holy)\n\nThe seraphim's cry 'Holy, Holy, Holy' (Hebrew: Kadosh, Kadosh, Kadosh) is the source of the Sanctus in Christian liturgy. The threefold repetition emphasizes the superlative holiness of God and, for Christians, prefigures the Trinity.\n\n## Purification Ministry\n\nWhen Isaiah cries 'Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips,' a seraph takes a burning coal from the altar and touches his lips, saying: 'Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for' (Isaiah 6:5-7). This demonstrates the seraphim's role as agents of divine purification.\n\n## Theological Significance\n\nSeraphim represent the highest form of created worship. Their burning nature symbolizes divine love that consumes all impurity. They model that even the most exalted beings approach God with reverence and humility.\n\n## The 'Burning Serpents' Connection\n\nThe Hebrew 'saraph' also refers to the 'burning serpents' sent among Israel in the wilderness (Numbers 21:6) and the bronze serpent Moses lifted up. Some scholars see a connection to winged serpent imagery in ancient Near Eastern art.\n\n",

  "description": "The Seraphim (Hebrew: seraphim, 'burning ones') are the highest order of angels in Christian angelology, standing closest to God's throne in perpetual adoration. They appear in Isaiah's throne-room vision (Isaiah 6:1-7) as beings of blazing light with six wings: two covering their faces in reverence before God's holiness, two covering their feet in humility, and two for flying in service. Their eternal song 'Holy, Holy, Holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of His glory!' (the Trisagion) shakes the foundations and fills the Temple with smoke. One seraph purifies Isaiah's lips with a burning coal from the altar, enabling him to speak God's word. The Seraphim's name suggests beings of consuming divine fire who embody the burning love of God that purifies and transforms.",
