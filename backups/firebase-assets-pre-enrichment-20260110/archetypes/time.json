  "name": "The Time Archetype",
  "definition": "The Time archetype represents the cosmic force governing the flow of existence itself - the eternal procession from past through present to future, the endless cycles of seasons, ages, and cosmic epochs. These deities embody humanity's profound contemplation of temporality: the relentless march of moments, the cyclical return of all things, and the paradox of eternal change. From the hourglass to the ouroboros, time gods remind mortals of their finite existence while revealing the immortal patterns that govern the universe. They are often depicted as ancient yet ageless, wielding the power to create and destroy entire worlds simply by allowing moments to pass.",
