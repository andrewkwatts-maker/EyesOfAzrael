After reviving many, it is said that he even raised Hippolytus at Artemis' request. But some say Glaucus, others Capaneus, others Tyndareus, and still others Hymenaeus... Zeus, fearing that men might learn the art of healing from him and so come to rescue each other, struck him with a thunderbolt.\"",
