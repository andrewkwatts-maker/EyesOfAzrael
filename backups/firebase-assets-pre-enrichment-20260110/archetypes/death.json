Then Izanami replied: 'How sad that you did not come sooner! I have already eaten of the hearth of Yomi. Yet I am honored that you have come here, my beloved husband. I will discuss with the gods of Yomi about returning. You must not look upon me.' But Izanagi grew impatient as he waited, and he lit a torch and entered to look. Maggots swarmed in Izanami's body, and in her head dwelt Great-Thunder, in her breast dwelt Fire-Thunder, in her belly dwelt Black-Thunder, in her genitals dwelt Crack-Thunder, in her left hand dwelt Young-Thunder, in her right hand dwelt Earth-Thunder, in her left foot dwelt Sounding-Thunder, in her right foot dwelt Reclining-Thunder— eight Thunder-Gods in all. Then Izanagi, seeing this, was afraid and turned to flee. Then Izanami said: 'You have put me to shame!' And she sent the hags of Yomi to pursue him. At last Izanagi escaped from the Land of Yomi and sealed the entrance with a great boulder. Standing on either side of the boulder, they pronounced their divorce. Then Izanami said: 'My beloved husband, if you do this, I shall each day strangle to death one thousand of the populace of your country.' To this Izanagi replied: 'My beloved wife, if you do this, I shall each day set up one thousand five hundred parturition huts.' Thus death entered the world, and Izanami became Queen of the Dead in Yomi-no-Kuni, the Land of Darkness.\"",

Behold, I have come to thee. I have brought thee Truth; I have repelled falsehood for thee. I have not done falsehood against men. I have not killed. I have not commanded to kill. I have not made suffering for anyone... Homage to thee, O Lord of Truth, I have brought thee the truth. I have destroyed wickedness for thee.

Thoth, lord of divine words, shall record the result. If the heart is found heavier than the feather, weighed down with sin and falsehood, it shall be devoured by Ammit, the Devourer, and the soul shall know the second death, from which there is no return. But if the heart is lighter than the feather, found pure and true, then Osiris, Lord of the Dead, enthroned in majesty, shall pronounce the soul justified, and the deceased shall enter the Field of Reeds, the blessed realm, to dwell in peace forever.\"",

From the Great Above, Inanna opened her ear to the Great Below. My Lady abandoned heaven and earth to descend to the underworld. Inanna abandoned heaven and earth to descend to the underworld. She abandoned her office of holy priestess to descend to the underworld. She gathered together the seven divine powers and took them in her hand. She prepared the seven divine garments and fastened them against her body: the crown of the steppe upon her head, measuring rod and line in her hand, lapis beads around her neck, twin egg-shaped stones upon her breast, a gold ring upon her hand, a breastplate called 'Come, man, come!' around her chest, and a royal robe draped about her body. Inanna set out for the underworld.\"",

At the second, the measuring rod. At the third, her lapis beads. At the fourth, the twin stones. At the fifth, her gold ring. At the sixth, her breastplate. At the seventh, her robe. Naked and bowed low, she entered the throne room of Ereshkigal, Queen of the Underworld. The seven judges of the underworld, the Annuna, fastened their eyes upon her—the eyes of death. At their word, the word which torments the spirit, the sick woman was turned into a corpse. The corpse was hung from a hook on the wall. Thus Inanna, Queen of Heaven and Earth, was humbled before her dark sister, Ereshkigal, Queen of the Dead. For three days and three nights Inanna hung upon the wall, learning what all mortals must: that death strips away all power, all beauty, all pretense—that before death, all are equal.\"",

        "text": "\"When Izanami-no-Mikoto gave birth to the fire-god Kagutsuchi, her genitals were burned, and she fell sick and died. Then Izanagi-no-Mikoto, wishing to meet again with his spouse Izanami-no-Mikoto, went after her to the Land of Yomi. When she came forth to greet him, Izanagi said: 'My beloved spouse, the lands which you and I were making have not yet been completed. You must come back!' Then Izanami replied: 'How sad that you did not come sooner! I have already eaten of the hearth of Yomi. Yet I am honored that you have come here, my beloved husband. I will discuss with the gods of Yomi about returning. You must not look upon me.' But Izanagi grew impatient as he waited, and he lit a torch and entered to look. Maggots swarmed in Izanami's body, and in her head dwelt Great-Thunder, in her breast dwelt Fire-Thunder, in her belly dwelt Black-Thunder, in her genitals dwelt Crack-Thunder, in her left hand dwelt Young-Thunder, in her right hand dwelt Earth-Thunder, in her left foot dwelt Sounding-Thunder, in her right foot dwelt Reclining-Thunder— eight Thunder-Gods in all. Then Izanagi, seeing this, was afraid and turned to flee. Then Izanami said: 'You have put me to shame!' And she sent the hags of Yomi to pursue him. At last Izanagi escaped from the Land of Yomi and sealed the entrance with a great boulder. Standing on either side of the boulder, they pronounced their divorce. Then Izanami said: 'My beloved husband, if you do this, I shall each day strangle to death one thousand of the populace of your country.' To this Izanagi replied: 'My beloved wife, if you do this, I shall each day set up one thousand five hundred parturition huts.' Thus death entered the world, and Izanami became Queen of the Dead in Yomi-no-Kuni, the Land of Darkness.\"",
