  "definition": "The Threshold Guardian stands at the boundary between worlds - the liminal deity who guards doorways, crossroads, and points of transition between states of being. This archetype embodies the challenge that must be faced before transformation can occur. Whether permitting or denying passage, the guardian tests worthiness, protects sacred spaces, and marks the moment where one reality ends and another begins.",
