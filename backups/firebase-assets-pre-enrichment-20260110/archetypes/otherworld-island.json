  "definition": "The Otherworld Island represents magical realms that exist outside normal reality, typically located far across the western sea toward the setting sun. These enchanted isles are paradise-like sanctuaries where time flows differently, death and aging are suspended, and healing and rejuvenation are available to those deemed worthy. Shrouded in mist and accessible only to the chosen few, these islands serve as resting places for heroes who will return in times of greatest need, embodying humanity's eternal hope for paradise beyond the horizon.",
