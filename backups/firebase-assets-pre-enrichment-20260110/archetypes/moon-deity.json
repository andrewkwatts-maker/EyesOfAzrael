  "definition": "The Moon Deity embodies the mysterious, cyclical, and transformative aspects of celestial divinity. Unlike the constant sun, the moon visibly changes—waxing from invisibility to fullness, waning back to darkness, then being \"reborn.\" This makes the moon the natural symbol of cycles, change, time measurement, fertility, and the hidden or unconscious realms. Notably, moon deities can be either male or female depending on culture: feminine in Greek ( Selene ), masculine in Mesopotamian ( Nanna /Sin) and Hindu ( Chandra ) traditions.",

There he sleeps forever in a cave, beautiful and ageless, and each night Selene descends from her chariot to gaze upon him and lie beside him. By him she bore fifty daughters, symbolizing the fifty lunar months of an Olympiad.\"",

She also has a share of honor in starry heaven, and is honored most of all by the deathless gods... For all who were born of Earth and Heaven who had honors, she has them all. Nor did the son of Kronos do her violence or take away what she received from the earlier gods called Titans, but she keeps the lot she had from the first division.\"",

She appears on the dark nights of the month, when the moon is hidden, and her approach is signaled by the barking of dogs. Offerings are left at crossroads on the dark moon—the deipna of Hecate : garlic, fish, eggs, honey cakes, and dogs. She guides Persephone from the underworld each spring, torch in hand, and receives the souls of the dead.\"",
