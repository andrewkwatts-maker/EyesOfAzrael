  "definition": "The War God embodies the divine aspect of combat, martial prowess, and the violence inherent in human civilization. This archetype appears in two primary forms: the savage, bloodthirsty deity who delights in slaughter (like Ares ), and the honorable warrior who embodies courage, strategy, and just warfare (like Tyr or Mars ). The War God represents humanity's relationship with organized violence—both its necessity for survival and its potential for destruction.",

By some chance the Tiber had overflowed its banks and formed stagnant pools, so that nowhere could the regular channel be approached. The bearers of the children imagined that infants could be drowned in any water... They placed the trough containing the twins in the nearest pool, where now stands the Ruminal fig tree. There a she-wolf, seeking water, found them and gave them suck. Thus Romulus and Remus , sons of Mars , founded the eternal city.\"",

Twice the gods tried to bind Fenrir with chains, and twice he broke free. Then the dwarves forged Gleipnir—smooth and soft as a silk ribbon but stronger than any chain, made from the sound of a cat's footstep, the beard of a woman, the roots of a mountain, the sinews of a bear, the breath of a fish, and the spittle of a bird. When the gods asked Fenrir to test this bond, he grew suspicious. 'Let one of you place his hand in my mouth as a pledge of good faith.' None would risk it—until Tyr put his right hand in the wolf's mouth. When Fenrir found he could not break free, he bit off Tyr's hand at the wrist. And so the god of war became one-handed.\"",

Her four hundred sons, the Centzon Huitznahua, and her daughter Coyolxauhqui , were enraged and came to kill her. As they approached, Huitzilopochtli sprang from his mother's womb fully grown and armed with the Xiuhcoatl , the fire serpent. He struck off Coyolxauhqui's head and sent her body tumbling down the mountainside. Then he pursued and scattered the four hundred brothers across the sky—they became the southern stars.\"",
