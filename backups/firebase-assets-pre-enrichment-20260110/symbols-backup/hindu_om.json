  "summary": "Om is the most sacred syllable and primordial sound in Hindu tradition, representing the essence of ultimate reality (Brahman) and the universe itself. This monosyllable encompasses all of creation, preservation, and dissolution, serving as the foundation of all mantras and spiritual practice.",
  "description": "Om (also written as Aum) is considered the primordial sound from which the entire universe emanated. It is the most sacred and powerful mantra in Hinduism, representing the essence of Brahman—the ultimate, unchanging reality amidst and beyond the world. The Mandukya Upanishad declares that Om is everything: the past, present, future, and that which transcends time itself. This sacred syllable is the seed (bija) of all mantras and the vibrational foundation of existence. When properly intoned, Om is believed to align the practitioner with the cosmic vibration that sustains all creation.",
