    "NOT established physics - String theory, M-theory, and dimensional physics remain experimentally unverified speculations",
    "HIGH risk of apophenia - Finding patterns in random data is a well-documented cognitive bias",
    "Alternative explanations exist - Coincidence, confirmation bias, numerological fallacies, and cultural projection are equally valid interpretations",
    "Numerology bias: The natural world contains countless numbers—finding matches between Kabbalah and physics is statistically probable by chance alone",
    "Retrofitting modern concepts: Projecting contemporary physics terminology (dimensions, branes, Euler characteristics) onto ancient mystical texts is methodologically questionable",
    "Confirmation bias: This analysis highlights numeric correlations while ignoring non-matching elements, incomplete correspondences, and contradictory data",
    "Cultural projection: Reading our scientific worldview into texts created for entirely different purposes (spiritual development, mystical contemplation)",
    "Unfalsifiability: Most proposed correlations cannot be experimentally tested or empirically disproven",
    "Selection effects: Kabbalah contains hundreds of numbers, concepts, and structures—some matches with physics are inevitable in such a rich symbolic system",
    "Misunderstanding both domains: Risk of oversimplifying both Kabbalistic depth and physics complexity to force artificial correlations",
    "13: The 13D shadow theory in physics parallels the 13 attributes of divine mercy in Kabbalah (Exodus 34:6-7) and the 13 petaled rose symbolism in mystical Judaism.",
    "7: The 7-dimensional G₂ manifold in compactification theory mirrors the seven lower Sefirot (Chesed through Malkhut), the seven days of creation, and the seven-fold structure of reality in Jewish mysticism.",
    "248: The Torah contains 248 positive commandments, corresponding to the traditional count of bones/organs in the human body. In physics, E₈—one of the exceptional Lie groups studied in string theory—has dimension 248.",
    "137: The fine structure constant α ≈ 1/137 governs electromagnetic interaction strength. In Jewish mysticism, 137 is the gematria of קַבָּלָה (Kabbalah) itself. Some medieval Kabbalists associated 137 with the phrase \"to receive\" or \"tradition.\""
