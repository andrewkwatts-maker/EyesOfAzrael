  "displayName": "Eye of Horus (Wadjet)",
  "type": "symbol",
  "mythology": "egyptian",
  "description": "The Eye of Horus, also known as Wadjet (meaning 'whole' or 'healthy') or Udjat, is one of the most powerful and recognizable symbols from ancient Egyptian mythology. This sacred emblem represents the left eye of the falcon-headed god Horus, which was lost in his legendary battle with Set and subsequently restored by the god Thoth. The Eye embodies concepts of protection, royal power, good health, and the restoration of wholeness. It served as an amulet of unparalleled importance throughout Egyptian history, appearing in funerary contexts, healing rituals, and royal regalia. The symbol's distinctive design incorporates the markings of a peregrine falcon beneath the eye, combined with the tear marking of a cheetah, creating an instantly recognizable icon that has endured for over 5,000 years.",
  "meaning": "Protection, healing, restoration, wholeness, royal power, and divine providence. The Eye of Horus represents the concept of making whole what was damaged, embodying the triumph of order over chaos and the restoration of Ma'at (cosmic balance).",
  "visualDescription": "The Eye of Horus depicts a stylized human eye with distinctive markings extending below and to the side. The symbol consists of six distinct parts: 1) The eyebrow - a curved line above the eye representing the brow ridge; 2) The pupil - the central circle representing sight and consciousness; 3) The eye itself - an almond-shaped outline representing the white of the eye; 4) The curved tail or teardrop - extending from the outer corner, representing the marking below a falcon's eye; 5) The vertical line - a straight stroke descending from the inner corner; 6) The spiral or curl - a decorative spiral element at the bottom representing the tear marking. Each of these six components was associated with a mathematical fraction (1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, and 1/64), which together total 63/64 - the missing 1/64 said to be supplied magically by Thoth. The eye is typically depicted facing right (representing the left eye of Horus facing the viewer) and is often rendered in gold, blue, green, or black against various backgrounds.",

  "usage": "In ancient Egypt, the Eye of Horus was one of the most commonly used protective symbols, appearing across virtually every aspect of Egyptian life and death. It was carved into temple walls, painted on coffins, inscribed on jewelry, and worn as amulets by both the living and the dead. Pharaohs incorporated the symbol into their royal regalia as a sign of divine authority and protection. The Eye appeared on prows of boats to ensure safe navigation, on the doors of houses for household protection, and was placed within mummy wrappings to protect the deceased in the afterlife. Physicians incorporated the symbol into medical practices, with the 'Rx' prescription symbol possibly deriving from the Eye of Horus. The fractional parts of the Eye were used as a system for measuring grain and other commodities, making it practical as well as spiritual.",
  "ritualUsage": "The Eye of Horus held central importance in Egyptian magical and religious practices. In funerary rituals, amulets bearing the Wadjet were placed on mummies at specific positions - particularly over incisions made during mummification - to promote healing and wholeness in the afterlife. The 'Opening of the Mouth' ceremony incorporated Eye of Horus imagery to restore the deceased's senses. Priests recited spells invoking the Eye's protective power during offerings to the gods. The symbol was used in healing magic, where practitioners would draw the Eye while reciting incantations to cure ailments, particularly eye diseases. Temple rituals included the daily 'restoration' of the Eye through offerings, symbolically reenacting Thoth's healing of Horus. The Eye was also invoked in protective magic against the 'evil eye' and malevolent spirits. During the Wag Festival and other lunar celebrations, the Eye's mythology was ritually reenacted to ensure cosmic renewal.",

  "historicalContext": "The Eye of Horus emerged as a significant symbol during the Early Dynastic Period (c. 3100-2686 BCE) and remained central to Egyptian religion and culture for over 3,000 years. The symbol's origins are intertwined with the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt, as Horus was the patron deity of the pharaohs and the Eye came to represent royal power. During the Old Kingdom, the Eye appeared prominently in the Pyramid Texts, establishing its role in funerary religion. The Middle Kingdom saw the democratization of afterlife beliefs, making Eye of Horus amulets accessible to non-royals. The New Kingdom represented the height of Eye symbolism, with elaborate amulets and extensive textual references. The symbol survived into the Ptolemaic and Roman periods, eventually influencing Mediterranean symbolism and possibly early Christian iconography. Archaeological evidence spans from Pre-Dynastic palette decorations to Roman-era amulets, demonstrating remarkable continuity. Major archaeological finds include thousands of faience amulets from sites like Amarna, gold Eye amulets from Tutankhamun's tomb, and monumental Eye carvings at temples like Edfu and Dendera. The Eye of Horus remains one of the most recognized ancient symbols worldwide, appearing in modern jewelry, tattoos, and popular culture.",
  "mythology_narrative": {
    "title": "The Wounding and Restoration of the Eye",
    "narrative": "After the murder of Osiris by his brother Set, a fierce struggle erupted between Set and Horus, the son of Osiris, for the throne of Egypt. This conflict, known as the Contendings of Horus and Set, lasted for eighty years and involved numerous battles, trials, and divine judgments. In one of the most brutal encounters, Set tore out Horus's left eye - in some versions ripping it into six pieces, in others gouging it out entirely or casting it into the darkness. The loss of the eye represented not merely physical injury but cosmic disruption, as the eye was associated with the moon, and its destruction caused darkness and chaos. Thoth, the ibis-headed god of wisdom, magic, and the moon, intervened to restore the damaged eye. Using his magical powers, Thoth gathered the pieces and healed the eye, making it 'wadjet' - whole and healthy once more. The restoration was so complete that the eye became more powerful than before, imbued with magical properties of healing and protection. Horus then offered the restored eye to his dead father Osiris in the underworld, and its life-giving power revived Osiris, allowing him to become king of the dead. This act of filial devotion established the Eye as a symbol of sacrifice, restoration, and the triumph of order over chaos. The myth explained lunar phenomena - the monthly waning of the moon represented the damaged eye, while the waxing moon showed its gradual restoration by Thoth."
