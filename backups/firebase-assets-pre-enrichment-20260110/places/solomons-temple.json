  "christianTypology": {
    "christAsTemple": "Jesus identified his body as the Temple (John 2:19-21). In the Incarnation, God 'tabernacled' among us (John 1:14). Christ is the meeting place between God and humanity - what the Temple symbolized, he embodies.",
    "churchAsTemple": "Paul teaches that the Church is God's Temple, with Christ as the cornerstone and believers as living stones (1 Corinthians 3:16-17, Ephesians 2:19-22, 1 Peter 2:4-5). The Spirit dwells in this spiritual Temple.",
    "bodyAsTemple": "Individual believers are temples of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19-20). Sanctification is understood as preparing God's dwelling place.",
    "heavenlyTemple": "Hebrews teaches that the earthly Temple was a 'copy and shadow' of the heavenly reality (Hebrews 8:5, 9:24). Christ entered the true holy place - heaven itself.",
    "eschatologicalTemple": "In the New Jerusalem, there is no temple 'for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb' (Revelation 21:22). The separation between God and humanity is overcome."
  },
  "theologicalSignificance": {
    "divinePresence": "The Temple was where God chose to dwell among his people. The Shekinah glory that filled Solomon's Temple (1 Kings 8:10-11) represented God's tangible presence. Christians see this presence fulfilled in Christ and the Spirit.",
    "sacrifice": "Temple worship centered on animal sacrifice for atonement. Christians understand Christ's death as the once-for-all sacrifice that Temple sacrifices foreshadowed (Hebrews 9-10). The Temple system taught the cost of sin and pointed to the Lamb of God.",
    "priesthood": "The Aaronic priesthood mediated between God and Israel. Christ is the eternal high priest 'after the order of Melchizedek' (Hebrews 7). Christians are a 'royal priesthood' (1 Peter 2:9) offering spiritual sacrifices.",
    "holyOfHolies": "Only the high priest could enter the innermost sanctuary, and only on the Day of Atonement. The Temple veil, torn at Christ's death (Matthew 27:51), signifies open access to God through Christ."
  },
  "liturgicalSignificance": {
    "christianWorship": "Temple themes pervade Christian liturgy: sacrifice (Eucharist), incense (prayer), altar, sanctuary, priesthood. Church architecture has often evoked Temple imagery.",
    "holyWeek": "Jesus' cleansing of the Temple occurred during his final week. The Last Supper took place during Passover, when Temple sacrifice was central. His death as the Passover Lamb occurred as lambs were slaughtered in the Temple.",
    "dedication": "The annual celebration of Hanukkah (Temple rededication) was observed by Jesus (John 10:22). Christian cathedral dedications echo Temple dedication."
  },
  "comparativeNotes": {
    "christian": "For Christians, Solomon's Temple represents the Old Covenant's beauty and limitation - God's presence manifested in a building, accessible through priests, requiring blood sacrifice. Christians see this entire system fulfilled and transcended in Christ. The Temple was real and God-given, but provisional - pointing forward to greater realities. Christ himself is the meeting place between God and humanity; his sacrifice ends all sacrifices; he opens the way into God's presence for all who believe. The torn veil signifies that what the Temple represented - access to God - is now universally available through Christ. Yet the Temple's symbolism continues: Christians speak of the Church as God's temple, believers' bodies as temples of the Spirit, and heaven as the true sanctuary. The Temple's destruction (AD 70), predicted by Jesus, marked the definitive end of the old system and vindicated the Church's claim that Christ fulfilled Temple worship. Christian architecture, liturgy, and spirituality remain profoundly shaped by Temple patterns - yet always understood as shadows pointing to the substance found in Christ."
