  "comparativeNotes": {
    "christian": "The River Styx as boundary between life and death invites comparison with Christian understanding of death and Christ's descent. Greek mythology portrayed death as a one-way crossing: the dead paid Charon's fare and entered Hades' realm permanently. The Christian gospel proclaims that Christ crossed this boundary in both directions - descending to the dead (1 Peter 3:19, Apostles' Creed: 'He descended into hell') and rising again, opening the way for humanity to follow. Where Styx represented impassable separation, Christ's resurrection breaks death's power. The requirement of burial rites and payment for crossing (the coin for Charon) contrasts with Christian salvation by grace: 'Come, everyone who thirsts, come to the waters; and he who has no money, come, buy and eat!' (Isaiah 55:1). The binding power of oaths sworn by Styx finds its parallel in Christ's new covenant, sealed not by river-water but by blood. Church fathers like Clement of Alexandria engaged Greek afterlife imagery, seeing in the underworld journey a shadow of the soul's journey to God - but radically transformed by Christ's victory over death.",
    "descentToUnderworld": "Christ's descent to the dead (descendit ad inferos) transformed ancient underworld imagery. The Harrowing of Hell tradition depicts Christ breaking down Hades' gates, liberating the righteous dead. Where Orpheus failed to rescue Eurydice from Hades, Christ succeeded in conquering death itself. The Greek underworld was a place of shadow-existence; Christian hope proclaims resurrection - not escape from the body but bodily transformation.",
    "baptismalTypology": "Early Christian baptismal theology used water-crossing imagery: as Israel crossed the Red Sea from slavery to freedom, believers cross baptismal waters from death to life (Romans 6:3-4). The Styx as death-boundary finds its Christian transformation in baptismal fonts - not crossing to shadowy death but rising to eternal life."
