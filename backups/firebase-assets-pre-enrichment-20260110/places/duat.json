  "comparativeNotes": {
    "christian": "The Egyptian Duat offers rich comparative material for understanding Christian beliefs about death, judgment, and afterlife. The weighing of the heart against Ma'at's feather of truth parallels the biblical theme of judgment according to one's deeds (Revelation 20:12). The Forty-Two Judges recall angelic assessors. Yet the differences are profound: in Egypt, the deceased must prove righteousness through spell-recitation and self-declaration of innocence; in Christianity, righteousness comes through faith in Christ and divine grace, not human merit. The Book of the Dead's magical formulas to navigate the underworld contrast with Christian trust in Christ who has 'the keys of death and Hades' (Revelation 1:18). The Duat's danger-filled passages, requiring secret knowledge to traverse, differ from the Christian hope that death leads immediately to Christ's presence (2 Corinthians 5:8, Philippians 1:23). Egyptian mummification to preserve the body for eternal life parallels Christian belief in bodily resurrection - though the resurrection hope looks to transformation rather than preservation. The Fields of Aaru, where the righteous dwell eternally, resemble paradise descriptions, while Ammit's consumption of the unrighteous parallels the 'second death' (Revelation 20:14). Early Christian art and thought engaged Egyptian imagery: Christ as judge, souls weighed, paradisiacal gardens. Whether through cultural inheritance or parallel intuition, both traditions grappled with death's meaning and the hope for vindication beyond the grave.",
    "christsDescentParallel": "The Christian doctrine of Christ's descent to the dead (1 Peter 3:18-20, Ephesians 4:8-10) enters this comparative conversation. Christ descended to the realm of the dead not to navigate dangers but to proclaim victory and liberate captives. The 'harrowing of hell' in Christian tradition depicts Christ breaking death's power from within - transforming the underworld from a place of imprisonment to a conquered domain. Where Egyptian souls needed spells for protection, Christian souls rest in Christ's triumph.",
    "judgmentTypology": "Both traditions understand that death leads to judgment. The Egyptian heart-weighing ceremony, with Thoth recording and Osiris presiding, parallels the biblical 'books opened' and divine judgment (Daniel 7:10, Revelation 20:12). But Christian theology emphasizes Christ as advocate (1 John 2:1) and his blood as covering for sin - categories absent from Egyptian soteriology. The Christian stands before judgment trusting not in accumulated virtue but in Christ's righteousness imputed by grace."
