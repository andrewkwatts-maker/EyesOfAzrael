  "longDescription": "Eastern Turkey (visible from Armenia) Mount Ararat (Turkish: Agri Dagi, Armenian: Masis) is a snow-capped dormant volcano and the highest\n                peak in Turkey, rising 5,137 meters (16,854 feet) near the border with Armenia and Iran. For thousands\n                of years, this majestic twin-peaked mountain has been identified as the resting place of Noah's Ark\n                after the Great Flood - the place where humanity began anew. While the Bible speaks only of the\n                \"mountains of Ararat\" (a region, not a specific peak), tradition has fixed this particular mountain\n                as the site where Noah, his family, and the animals disembarked to repopulate the earth. This\n                identification has made Ararat one of the most symbolically powerful mountains in the Abrahamic traditions.",

  "theologicalSignificance": {
    "newBeginning": "Ararat represents humanity's second beginning. After the flood's judgment, Noah's family stepped onto Ararat to begin anew. The mountain symbolizes God's preservation of a righteous remnant through judgment - a pattern repeated throughout Scripture.",
    "noahicCovenant": "On Ararat, God established the covenant with Noah - promising never again to destroy earth by flood. The rainbow became the sign of this covenant, visible from Ararat's slopes. Christians see this as a foundation for subsequent covenants, culminating in Christ.",
    "typology": "The ark carrying eight persons through judgment waters prefigures baptism (1 Peter 3:20-21). As Noah's family passed through water to new life, believers pass through baptismal waters to resurrection life in Christ. The ark itself becomes a type of the Church or of Christ, the vessel of salvation.",
    "noahAsType": "Noah, the one righteous man who 'found grace in the eyes of the Lord' (Genesis 6:8), prefigures Christ, the truly righteous one through whom all humanity may be saved. As Noah built the ark at God's command, Christ builds his Church."

  "armenianTradition": {
    "nationalSymbol": "Ararat is Armenia's national symbol, appearing on the coat of arms despite lying in Turkey. Armenian Christianity, one of the oldest national churches (traditionally dated to 301 CE), has deep associations with Ararat.",
    "echmiadzinLegend": "Armenian tradition holds that after Noah descended from Ararat, he first saw the sun rise at the site of Echmiadzin ('where the Only Begotten descended'), where the Armenian Apostolic Church established its headquarters.",
    "monasticTradition": "Armenian monks maintained presence near Ararat for centuries. The Khor Virap monastery, with Ararat as its backdrop, marks where Gregory the Illuminator was imprisoned before converting Armenia to Christianity."

  "arkSearches": {
    "ancientAccounts": "Early explorers claimed sightings. The 3rd-century bishop Jacob of Nisibis allegedly retrieved a fragment. Marco Polo mentioned the 'Ark Mountain.'",
    "modernExpeditions": "Numerous expeditions have searched for ark remains. Claims of wood fragments, 'anomalies' on satellite images, and supposed structures have never been verified scientifically. The mountain remains ice-capped and treacherous.",
    "theologicalPerspective": "Whether the ark is found matters less theologically than the narrative's meaning. The story proclaims God's judgment on sin, preservation of the faithful, and promise of new beginning - themes that point to Christ and ultimate redemption."
  },
  "comparativeNotes": {
    "christian": "Mount Ararat stands in Christian imagination as the site of humanity's second beginning - where Noah, having trusted God through unprecedented catastrophe, stepped onto solid ground and worshipped. The flood narrative teaches that God judges sin yet provides means of salvation, preserving a remnant through whom his purposes continue. Christians see in Noah a type of Christ and in the ark a type of the Church or baptism: as Noah was saved through water, believers are saved through baptismal waters; as the ark preserved a remnant from judgment, Christ preserves his people from ultimate condemnation. The Noahic covenant, with its rainbow sign visible from Ararat's slopes, established divine commitment to creation that finds its fulfillment in God's covenant in Christ. Whether the ark physically remains on Ararat is secondary to the truth it embodies: God preserves those who trust him through judgment to new life."
