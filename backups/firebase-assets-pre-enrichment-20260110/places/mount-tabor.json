  "longDescription": "Mount Tabor (Hebrew: Har Tavor) is a distinctive, dome-shaped mountain rising 575 meters above sea level in Lower Galilee, Israel. Since at least the 4th century CE, Christian tradition has identified this mountain as the site of Jesus Christ's Transfiguration, described in the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew 17:1-9; Mark 9:2-8; Luke 9:28-36). On this 'high mountain apart,' Jesus was transfigured before Peter, James, and John - his face shining like the sun, his garments becoming dazzling white - while Moses and Elijah appeared conversing with him about his 'exodus' (departure/death) to be accomplished in Jerusalem. The voice of the Father declared: 'This is my beloved Son; listen to him.' The mountain's isolated position, rising dramatically from the surrounding plain, made it a natural site for sacred significance long before Christianity. The Hebrew Bible mentions Tabor as a tribal boundary marker and as the gathering point for Deborah and Barak's forces before their victory over the Canaanite general Sisera. Its distinctive shape made it proverbial for greatness (Psalm 89:12; Jeremiah 46:18).",

    "byzantinePeriod": "Three churches were built on the summit in the 6th century, commemorating the three 'tabernacles' Peter offered to build. Byzantine pilgrims would ascend the mountain, celebrate liturgy, and seek spiritual renewal in the place of Christ's revealed glory.",
    "crusaderPeriod": "Benedictine monks established a monastery (1099). After the Battle of Hattin (1187), Saladin fortified the summit. The fortress was later dismantled. Crusader ruins remain visible today.",
    "modernPeriod": "The Franciscan Basilica of the Transfiguration (1924), designed by Antonio Barluzzi, crowns the summit. The Greek Orthodox Church of Elijah maintains Orthodox presence. Pilgrims visit year-round, especially on the Feast of the Transfiguration (August 6)."
  },
  "sacredSites": {
    "basilicaOfTransfiguration": "The Franciscan basilica (1924) features stunning mosaics of the Transfiguration scene. The design incorporates two side chapels dedicated to Moses and Elijah, recalling the three tabernacles Peter proposed. Beneath lie remains of Byzantine and Crusader churches.",
    "churchOfElijah": "The Greek Orthodox church (19th century) serves Eastern Christian pilgrims. Its location near the summit maintains the ancient Orthodox tradition of veneration.",
    "grottoes": "Various caves and grottoes are venerated as places of prayer, including the traditional spot of the disciples' sleep during Christ's prayer.",
    "viewpoints": "The summit offers commanding views of the Jezreel Valley, Mount Hermon, and the Sea of Galilee - a panorama connecting numerous biblical sites."
  },
  "comparativeNotes": {
    "christian": "Mount Tabor represents a pivotal moment in salvation history: the revelation of Christ's divine glory. Unlike Sinai, where God's glory was terrifying and unapproachable, Tabor reveals glory in the person of Jesus - the God who becomes one with humanity. The presence of Moses and Elijah confirms that Jesus fulfills the Law and Prophets, while their conversation about his 'exodus' connects the Transfiguration to the cross and resurrection. For Eastern Christians, Tabor has particular theological significance: the uncreated light that shone from Christ is the same divine energy available to those who pursue holiness, making Tabor a vision of human destiny - transformation into God's likeness.",
    "sinaiConnection": "The Transfiguration deliberately echoes Sinai: both mountains, overshadowing cloud, divine voice, Moses present, divine glory revealed. But the Transfiguration transcends Sinai: the glory is not on a mountain but in a Person; the voice says not 'obey the law' but 'listen to him'; Moses is not the mediator but a witness. Where Israel could not look on Moses' glorified face, the disciples see Christ's unveiled glory and are invited into it."
