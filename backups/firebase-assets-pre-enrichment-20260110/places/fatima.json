  "longDescription": "Fatima is one of the most important Marian shrines in the world, where the Virgin Mary reportedly appeared to three shepherd children - Lucia dos Santos (10), Francisco Marto (9), and Jacinta Marto (7) - six times between May 13 and October 13, 1917. The apparitions occurred during World War I, and the Virgin's messages centered on prayer (especially the Rosary), penance, conversion, and the consecration of Russia to her Immaculate Heart. The final apparition concluded with the 'Miracle of the Sun,' witnessed by an estimated 70,000 people. The three 'Secrets of Fatima' revealed to the children concerned a vision of hell, devotion to Mary's Immaculate Heart and the fate of Russia, and a vision of persecution and the assassination attempt on a pope (interpreted as Pope John Paul II in 1981). The apparitions were approved by the local bishop in 1930, and Fatima has since become one of the most visited Catholic pilgrimage sites in the world, receiving approximately 6 million visitors annually.",
