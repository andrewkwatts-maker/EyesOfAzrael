  "history": "Historical Overview --> &#128220; Historical Overview The Golden Temple, officially known as Harmandir Sahib (Punjabi: \"The Abode of God\") or Darbar Sahib (\"Court of the Lord\"), is the holiest gurdwara and the most important pilgrimage site of Sikhism. Located in Amritsar (meaning \"Pool of Nectar\"), Punjab, India, the temple was founded by Guru Ram Das in 1577 and completed by Guru Arjan in 1604, who installed the Adi Granth (the first compilation of Sikh scriptures) within its sanctum. The temple sits at the center of a sacred pool (sarovar) that gives the city its name, symbolizing the nectar of immortality that purifies the soul. \"I have created a place of pilgrimage that shall be called Amritsar. Anyone who bathes in the tank of nectar shall have all their sins washed away and shall find a place in my true court.\" - Guru Ram Das, Fourth Sikh Guru The temple was destroyed multiple times during Mughal persecution and Afghan invasions, only to be rebuilt each time by devoted Sikhs. In 1802, Maharaja Ranjit Singh began covering the upper floors with gold leaf, giving the temple its current gleaming appearance and popular name. Today, Harmandir Sahib attracts over 100,000 visitors daily, making it one of the most visited religious sites in the world. The temple embodies core Sikh values of equality, service (seva), and hospitality, offering free meals (langar) to all visitors regardless of religion, caste, gender, or social status. 1577 Guru Ram Das excavates the sacred pool (Amritsar) 1588 Foundation stone laid by Sufi saint Mian Mir (symbolizing interfaith harmony) 1604 Guru Arjan installs the Adi Granth;
