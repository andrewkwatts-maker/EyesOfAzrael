  "subtitle": "The Swift-Footed - Greatest Warrior of the Greeks",
  "description": "Achilles (Akhilleus) was the greatest warrior of the Greek army at Troy and the central figure of Homer's Iliad. Son of the mortal Peleus and the sea-goddess Thetis, he was destined to either live a long, obscure life or die young with eternal glory—he chose glory. His wrath (menis) at being dishonored by Agamemnon and his grief over Patroclus's death drive the Iliad's tragedy. Swift-footed, nearly invulnerable (except for his famous heel), and supremely skilled in war, Achilles embodies the Greek heroic ideal in its most intense and problematic form: the hero who achieves immortal fame (kleos) at the cost of his life.",

    "overview": "Achilles presents a complex case for Christian typology. As the supreme warrior who chooses glorious death, he both parallels and contrasts with Christ. The Church Fathers engaged with him as an example of heroic virtue and tragic limitation.",

    "griefAndLove": "Achilles's overwhelming grief for Patroclus—his refusal of food, his dust-and-ashes mourning—parallels Christ's grief in Gethsemane and his love for Lazarus (John 11:35). Both reveal divine-human figures moved by human bonds.",
    "wrathAndMercy": "The Iliad's arc moves from wrath (menis) to compassion (releasing Hector's body). This mirrors the biblical arc from divine wrath to mercy, though Achilles's transformation is personal, not cosmic.",
    "vulnerableHeel": "Achilles's one point of vulnerability represents human mortality breaking through divine protection. Christ's vulnerability is wholly chosen—he could have called legions of angels (Matthew 26:53) but chose mortal death.",
    "divineArmorAndSpiritualWarfare": "The divine armor Hephaestus forges (Iliad 18) prefigures the 'armor of God' in Ephesians 6:11-17. The shield depicting the cosmos suggests creation protected by divine craft.",
