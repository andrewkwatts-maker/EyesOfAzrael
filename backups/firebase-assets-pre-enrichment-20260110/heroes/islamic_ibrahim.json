      "rejection_of_idols": "Ibrahim questioned idol worship from a young age. He observed the stars, moon, and sun, concluding that none could be God because they all set. He declared: 'I have turned my face toward He who created the heavens and the earth, inclining toward truth, and I am not of those who associate others with Allah.' (Quran 6:79)",
      "destroying_idols": "When his people left for a festival, Ibrahim destroyed all the idols except the largest. When confronted, he said: 'Ask the biggest one - he did it.' This exposed the absurdity of worshipping powerless objects.",
      "trial_by_fire": "King Nimrod ordered Ibrahim thrown into a massive fire. Allah commanded: 'O fire, be coolness and safety upon Ibrahim!' (Quran 21:69). The fire became like a garden for him.",
      "sacrifice_of_son": "Allah commanded Ibrahim in a dream to sacrifice his son. Both father and son submitted: 'O my father, do as you are commanded. You will find me, if Allah wills, of the steadfast.' (Quran 37:102). Allah ransomed the son with a ram, declaring: 'Indeed, this was the clear trial.' (Quran 37:106)"

    "building_kaaba": "Ibrahim and his son Ismail raised the foundations of the Sacred House (Kaaba) in Makkah. They prayed: 'Our Lord, accept this from us. Indeed You are the Hearing, the Knowing. Our Lord, and make us Muslims [in submission] to You and from our descendants a Muslim nation.' (Quran 2:127-128)",
    "legacy": "Ibrahim established monotheistic worship and the pilgrimage rituals. His descendants include all the prophets of Israel through Ishaq, and Prophet Muhammad through Ismail. Muslims invoke blessings upon Ibrahim in every prayer.",
    "theological_significance": "Ibrahim represents the archetype of complete submission to Allah (the meaning of 'Islam'). His willingness to sacrifice his son demonstrates the ultimate test of faith. The Hajj pilgrimage commemorates events from his life and that of his family."
