  "description": "Perseus stands among the greatest heroes of Greek mythology, the first of the great Hellenic monster-slayers and founder of the Perseid dynasty. Born of Zeus (who visited Danae as a shower of golden rain) and the mortal princess Danae of Argos, Perseus was cast into the sea with his mother in a wooden chest by her father Acrisius, who feared an oracle that his grandson would kill him. Rescued on the island of Seriphos, Perseus grew to manhood and was sent on what seemed an impossible quest: to bring back the head of the Gorgon Medusa, whose gaze turned all who looked upon her to stone. With divine gifts from the gods—winged sandals, a cap of invisibility, the curved sword harpe, and a magic bag—he accomplished the impossible, also rescuing the Ethiopian princess Andromeda from a sea monster and founding the great city of Mycenae.",

Flying to the western edge of the world, Perseus found the Gorgons sleeping. Using Athena's polished shield as a mirror to avoid Medusa's direct gaze, he decapitated her with the harpe.
