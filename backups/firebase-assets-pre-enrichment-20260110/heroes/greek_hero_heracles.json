  "description": "The greatest of all Greek heroes, Heracles (Hercules in Latin) was born of Zeus and the mortal princess Alcmene of Thebes. His name means 'Glory of Hera,' though paradoxically the goddess persecuted him relentlessly. Through his legendary Twelve Labors—imposed as penance for a crime committed in divine madness—and countless heroic deeds, he transcended mortality to achieve apotheosis, becoming a god welcomed among the immortals on Mount Olympus. Heracles embodies the Greek ideal of the suffering hero who attains glory through endurance (ponos) and achieves immortality through virtue. His cult was the most widespread of any Greek hero, with temples from Thasos to Sicily.",
