In modern Mexico, Quetzalcoatl is celebrated as a symbol of pre-Hispanic heritage and indigenous wisdom. His association with learning, arts, and opposition to human sacrifice makes him an appealing figure for contemporary interpretations of Aztec spirituality. New Age movements have also adopted him as a symbol of transformation and cosmic consciousness.",
