        "description": "Spanish missionaries encountered Quetzalcoatl traditions and debated their significance. Some (like Fray Diego Duran) proposed Quetzalcoatl represented St. Thomas the Apostle's ancient mission to the Americas. Most scholars now reject this theory.",
        "significance": "Early missionaries' attempts to find Christian connections in Quetzalcoatl illustrate both the desire to find preparatio evangelica and the dangers of over-interpretation.",

          "distinction": "Quetzalcoatl's return is mythical expectation within cyclical time; Christ's return is eschatological hope within linear history. Christ historically died and rose; Quetzalcoatl's 'death' is departure."
