His cult drove the expansion of the empire as the need for sacrificial victims justified constant warfare. The image of the eagle on the cactus - his prophetic sign - remains Mexico's national symbol, connecting the modern nation to its Aztec past. In contemporary discussions, Huitzilopochtli raises complex questions about religion, imperialism, and sacrifice. Modern Mexicanist movements sometimes invoke him as a symbol of indigenous power and resistance, while scholars debate the scale and meaning of Aztec human sacrifice. His mythology continues to fascinate as an example of how religion, warfare, and state power can intertwine.",
