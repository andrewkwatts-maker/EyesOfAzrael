  "longDescription": "The laurel or bay tree (Greek: δάφνη daphne) is sacred to Apollo, god of prophecy, music, and the arts. According to myth, the nymph Daphne transformed into a laurel tree to escape Apollo's pursuit, and Apollo declared the tree sacred to him thereafter. Laurel wreaths crowned victors in the Pythian Games at Delphi, poets and artists, and military commanders celebrating triumphs. The Pythia (Oracle of Delphi) chewed laurel leaves to induce prophetic trances, and laurel branches purified sacred spaces. The tree's evergreen nature symbolized immortality and eternal glory, while its aromatic properties connected it to divine inspiration and purification. Apollo's lyre was often made with laurel wood, linking the tree to artistic creativity.",

The Daphne myth adds layers of meaning: unrequited love, transformation, the boundary between divine and mortal realms, and how loss can be transmuted into sacred beauty. The aromatic leaves suggest divine inspiration—poets and prophets alike breathe the laurel's essence to access higher knowledge.",
