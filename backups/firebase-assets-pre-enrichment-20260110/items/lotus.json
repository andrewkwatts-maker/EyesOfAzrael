      "The lotus was central to Egyptian cosmology and daily religious practice. In Hermopolitan creation myths, the sun god (as a child or scarab) emerged from a lotus that arose from the waters of Nun at the beginning of time. The flower's daily opening and closing mirrored Ra's journey across the sky, making it the ultimate symbol of solar resurrection. Blue lotus flowers were offered to gods in temples, worn as garlands in festivals, and placed in tombs to ensure rebirth.

The flower is offered in worship as a symbol of devotion and purity.",
      "usage": "The lotus (Padma/Kamala) is central to Hindu cosmology and worship. Brahma is born from a lotus emerging from Vishnu's navel at the beginning of creation. The lotus is offered to deities in puja (worship), represents the chakras in yogic practice, and symbolizes the ideal of living in the world but remaining unstained by its materialism - like the lotus in muddy water.",

  "longDescription": "The lotus flower (Nymphaea caerulea - blue lotus, and Nymphaea lotus - white lotus) held profound sacred significance in ancient Egypt, symbolizing creation, rebirth, resurrection, and the sun itself. The blue lotus emerges from muddy waters each morning and opens with the sunrise, closing at sunset - a perfect metaphor for the sun god Ra's daily journey and the cycle of death and rebirth. Egyptian creation myths describe the world beginning when a lotus emerged from the primordial waters of Nun, from which the sun god was born. The lotus's intoxicating fragrance was associated with divine perfume and spiritual ecstasy. Pharaohs, nobles, and gods are depicted holding or smelling lotus flowers, and the plant featured prominently in temple architecture as column capitals and decorative motifs.",
