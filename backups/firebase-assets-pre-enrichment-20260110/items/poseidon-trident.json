      "content": "The Trident of Poseidon stands as one of the most recognizable divine weapons\n                    in Greek mythology, the three-pronged spear that symbolizes the sea god's\n                    dominion over the oceans, earthquakes, and horses. This mighty weapon is\n                    inseparable from Poseidon's identity - in virtually every ancient depiction,\n                    the god holds his trident as both weapon and scepter of his underwater kingdom.\n                \n                \n                    The trident's three prongs represent Poseidon's threefold domain: the surface\n                    of the sea, its depths, and the creatures within it. Some interpretations\n                    connect the prongs to past, present, and future, or to birth, life, and death\n                    as they relate to the sea's power to give and take life.\n                \n                \n                    As a symbol, the trident transcended Greek religion to become a universal\n                    emblem of maritime power. Roman Neptune inherited the weapon along with\n                    Poseidon's attributes, and the trident remains associated with naval imagery\n                    to this day.",

These three sons of Uranus and\n                    Gaia had been imprisoned in Tartarus by Cronus but were freed by Zeus to\n                    aid the Olympians.\n                \n                \n                    In gratitude and as weapons for the war, the Cyclopes forged three divine\n                    instruments: the thunderbolt for Zeus, the helm of invisibility for Hades,\n                    and the trident for Poseidon. These weapons proved decisive in the Olympians'\n                    victory, each embodying dominion over a realm of the cosmos.\n                \n\n                Symbol of Cosmic Division\n                \n                    After the Titans' defeat, the three brothers - Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades -\n                    divided the universe among themselves. Zeus received the sky, Hades the\n                    underworld, and Poseidon the seas. The trident became both weapon and\n                    symbol of Poseidon's sovereignty over his watery domain, just as the\n                    thunderbolt represented Zeus's rule of the heavens.",

Poseidon struck the Acropolis with\n                    his trident, producing either a saltwater spring or (in some versions)\n                    the first horse. Athena offered the olive tree. The citizens chose\n                    Athena's gift, and Poseidon's anger at losing caused him to flood the\n                    Thriasian plain.\n                \n\n                The Odyssey\n                \n                    Throughout the Odyssey, Poseidon uses his trident's powers to torment\n                    Odysseus for blinding the Cyclops Polyphemus, Poseidon's son. The god\n                    raises storms and shipwrecks that extend Odysseus's journey for years.\n                \n\n                The Trojan War\n                \n                    During the Trojan War, Poseidon used his trident to aid the Greeks,\n                    building the walls of Troy (which he later helped destroy) and\n                    intervening in various battles.

      "content": "Powers and Abilities Control of the Seas The trident grants Poseidon complete mastery over all bodies of water. He can calm or stir storms, raise or lower water levels, and control currents and tides at will. Earthquake Generation By striking the earth with his trident, Poseidon can cause earthquakes of any magnitude. This power earned him the title \"Earth-Shaker\" (Enosichthon/Ennosigaios). Spring Creation The trident can strike the ground to create freshwater springs. In the contest for Athens, Poseidon struck the Acropolis to produce a spring (though it was saltwater). Horse Creation Poseidon created the first horse by striking a rock with his trident. This established his patronage over horses and equestrian pursuits. Shipwreck and Salvation The trident can destroy ships or calm waters to save them. Sailors prayed to Poseidon for safe voyage, fearing his wrath if disrespected. Combat Prowess As a physical weapon, the trident is formidable in battle, capable of wounding even other gods and destroying monsters."
