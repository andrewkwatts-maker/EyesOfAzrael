When Moses\n                    successfully pulled the staff from the ground, Jethro recognized him as the one destined\n                    to deliver Israel.\n                \n\n                \n                    \"And you shall take in your hand this staff, with which you shall do the signs.\"\n                    — Exodus 4:17\n                \n\n                The Name of God\n                \n                    Some traditions hold that the Ineffable Name of God (YHWH) was inscribed upon the staff,\n                    being the source of its miraculous power.

  "mythology": "MYTHOLOGY AND ORIGIN --> Origin and Sacred History Rabbinic Traditions Jewish tradition provides elaborate backstories for the staff. According to Midrashic sources, the staff was created at twilight on the sixth day of Creation, one of ten miraculous objects made before the first Sabbath. It passed through generations of patriarchs: from Adam to Enoch to Noah to Shem to Abraham to Isaac to Jacob to Joseph. After Joseph's death, the staff came into Pharaoh's possession, then to Jethro (Reuel), who planted it in his garden where it remained fixed until Moses arrived. When Moses successfully pulled the staff from the ground, Jethro recognized him as the one destined to deliver Israel. \"And you shall take in your hand this staff, with which you shall do the signs.\" — Exodus 4:17 The Name of God Some traditions hold that the Ineffable Name of God (YHWH) was inscribed upon the staff, being the source of its miraculous power. This connection between the divine Name and supernatural ability appears throughout Jewish mystical literature. Islamic Tradition In Islamic tradition, the staff (Asa Musa) features prominently in the Quran's account of Moses (Musa). The staff transforms into a serpent that devours the staffs of Pharaoh's magicians, demonstrating the superiority of God's power over Egyptian magic.",

The staff that became a serpent, and the bronze serpent lifted on a pole, prefigure Christ lifted on the cross for humanity's salvation.",

      "liturgical": "The Easter Vigil prominently features the Exodus narrative. The parting of the Red Sea is read as type of baptism. The Paschal candle, held like a staff, leads the congregation through darkness.",
      "medieval": "Medieval exegesis saw the staff in numerological and allegorical terms. Hugh of St. Victor's 'De sacramentis' treats the staff among Old Testament sacramental prefigurations. The Biblia Pauperum pairs staff miracles with Gospel parallels.",
