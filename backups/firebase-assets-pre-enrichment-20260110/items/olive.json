  "longDescription": "The olive tree holds supreme sacred status in Greek mythology as Athena's gift to humanity and Athens specifically. In the contest between Athena and Poseidon for patronage of Athens, Poseidon struck the Acropolis with his trident creating a salt-water spring, while Athena caused the first olive tree to sprout from the rock. The Athenians judged Athena's gift superior, as the olive provided food (olives and oil), light (lamp fuel), economic prosperity (trade), wood, and medicinal benefits. The tree represents civilization, wisdom's triumph over brute force, peace, and divine blessing. Olive oil anointed athletes, fueled sacred lamps, and served as offerings. Olive wreaths crowned Olympic victors, and branches symbolized peace and supplication.",
