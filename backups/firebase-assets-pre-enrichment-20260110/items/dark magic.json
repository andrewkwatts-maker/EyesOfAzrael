The hand had to be severed from a hanged criminal while still on the gibbet,\n                    preferably during an eclipse or at a crossroads. It was then wrapped in a piece of the\n                    corpse's shroud, squeezed to drain remaining blood, and pickled in an earthen vessel\n                    with various salts and peppers for a fortnight.\n                \n                \n                    After pickling, the hand was dried in an oven with vervain and fern, then fashioned\n                    into a candle holder. A candle was made from the criminal's fat, virgin wax, and\n                    sesame oil (or alternatively, the fingers themselves were set alight). The resulting\n                    artifact was believed to be virtually unstoppable in its magical effects.\n                \n\n                Countermeasures\n                \n                    Folk tradition also preserved methods to defend against the Hand of Glory:\n                \n                \n                    Anointing the threshold with an ointment made from the gall of a black cat, owl fat, and blood\n                    Blood from a screech owl was said to neutralize its effects\n                    Milk was believed to be the only substance that could extinguish its flames\n                    Keeping consecrated objects or religious items in the home",
