  "longDescription": "Shimenawa (注連縄 or 標縄, 'enclosing rope' or 'marked rope') is a sacred rope woven from rice straw, one of the most recognizable symbols of Shinto. According to mythology, when Amaterasu emerged from the Heavenly Rock Cave after being lured out by the kami, the deity Futodama-no-Mikoto quickly stretched a shimenawa across the cave entrance to prevent her from retreating back into the darkness. This rope became the primordial boundary between sacred and profane space. Shimenawa are placed around sacred trees, rocks, buildings, and shrine entrances to mark the presence of kami and create sanctified zones. The rope is often adorned with shide (zigzag paper streamers), which represent lightning and the descent of divine energy. Different regions have distinct shimenawa styles, from simple twisted straw to massive ropes weighing tons. The braiding direction (typically left over right) and the number of twists carry symbolic meaning. Rice straw is used because rice itself is sacred, making the rope both physically and spiritually pure. The shimenawa creates a threshold between the ordinary world and sacred space where kami dwell.",
  "cultural": {
    "worshipPractices": [
      "Shimenawa define sacred space in Shinto practice. They encircle sacred trees (go-shintai), rocks, and natural formations where kami dwell. They hang across shrine entrances (torii gates) and above doorways. During New Year, shimenawa are placed on homes for protection and blessing. The rope signifies that impurity cannot cross the boundary—kami space is separated from the profane world. Walking beneath a shimenawa means entering sacred territory where respect and purity are required."
    ],
    "modernLegacy": {
      "culturalImpact": "Shimenawa remain ubiquitous in Japan, visible at thousands of shrines and sacred sites. The massive shimenawa at Izumo Taisha weighs over 5 tons and requires reconstruction every few years using traditional techniques. Each New Year, Japanese homes display shimekazari (decorative shimenawa) to welcome ancestral spirits and kami. The rope marks sacred trees, waterfalls, mountains, and unusual rock formations throughout the landscape. Sumo wrestling maintains shimenawa symbolism, with the ring considered sacred space and yokozuna (grand champions) wearing a ceremonial shimenawa. The simple act of braiding rice straw into rope continues an unbroken tradition linking modern Japan to its mythological origins."
