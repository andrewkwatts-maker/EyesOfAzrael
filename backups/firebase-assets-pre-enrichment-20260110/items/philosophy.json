According to the tale told by Glaucon, Gyges was a shepherd in the service of\n                    the King of Lydia. One day, after a great storm and earthquake, a chasm opened in the\n                    earth near where he was feeding his flock.\n                \n                \n                    Curious, Gyges descended into the chasm and discovered, among other wonders, a hollow\n                    bronze horse with doors. Inside was the corpse of a being larger than a man, wearing\n                    nothing but a golden ring on its finger. Gyges took the ring and returned to the surface.\n                \n                \n                    Later, while sitting among other shepherds, Gyges happened to turn the bezel of the ring\n                    inward toward his palm. Instantly, he became invisible to his companions, who spoke of\n                    him as if he had left. Turning the bezel outward again made him visible. Once he\n                    understood the ring's power, Gyges arranged to be one of the messengers sent to the king.\n                    There he seduced the queen, killed the king with her help, and seized the throne.",
