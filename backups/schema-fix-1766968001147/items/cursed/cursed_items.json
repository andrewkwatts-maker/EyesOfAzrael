In some versions, this was arranged by Hildr herself\n                    or was the result of magical compulsion. Regardless of the cause, Hogni\n                    pursued Hedinn across the seas to recover his daughter.\n                \n                \n                    When the two kings finally met on the island of Haey (identified with the\n                    Orkney Islands or another northern location), Hildr attempted to negotiate\n                    peace between them.
