The emperor, as the \"Son of Heaven\" (Tianzi), was the sole intermediary between the\n                mortal world and the celestial realm, and these annual ceremonies at the Temple of Heaven were\n                considered essential to maintaining cosmic harmony and ensuring the prosperity of the empire.",
