    "origins": "The Akitu festival dates to at least the early 2nd millennium BCE in Sumerian tradition, where it celebrated the New Year and agricultural renewal. Under Babylonian rule, it became centered on Marduk and incorporated the Enuma Elish creation narrative.",
    "decline": "The festival continued into the Seleucid period but eventually declined with the rise of Christianity and the abandonment of traditional Mesopotamian religion.",
    "persianPeriod": "After Cyrus the Great conquered Babylon (539 BCE), he restored the Akitu festival and proper worship of Marduk, as documented in the Cyrus Cylinder, to legitimize Persian rule.",

    "significance": "The festival was so important that its cancellation was recorded in chronicles as a sign of political instability. The Akitu Chronicle documents that during King Nabonidus's absence (when he stayed in Tema in Arabia), the festival was not celebrated, causing public disturbance."
