  "mythology_story": "The tale of the Minotaur is one of broken vows, divine vengeance, and ultimately heroic triumph. It begins not with the monster itself, but with a king's hubris and a god's wrath. When the time came for the third tribute, Theseus , the young prince of Athens and son of King Aegeus (or of Poseidon himself, by some accounts), volunteered to join the sacrificial group. He swore to his father that he would slay the monster and end Athens's shame forever. If he succeeded, he would raise white sails on his return; if he perished, the ship would bear black sails of mourning.",
