This potential\n                    connection places Caladbolg among the ancestors of the most famous sword in\n                    Western mythology, suggesting a common Celtic root for these legendary blades.\n                \n                \n                    Unlike many magical swords that grant invincibility or have specific mystical\n                    powers, Caladbolg's fame comes primarily from its sheer destructive force -\n                    it was simply the most powerful weapon any mortal could wield, capable of\n                    devastating feats that reshaped the landscape itself."

This betrayal drove Fergus to join Ulster's enemies, the Connacht\n                    army of Queen Medb.\n                \n                \n                    Despite fighting against his former homeland, Fergus remained bound by certain\n                    geasa (sacred obligations) and complex loyalties. His relationship with his\n                    foster-son Cu Chulainn, Ulster's greatest hero, created constant tension during\n                    the Tain Bo Cuailnge (The Cattle Raid of Cooley), the central epic of the Ulster\n                    Cycle.\n                \n\n                Caladbolg in the Tain Bo Cuailnge\n                \n                    During the great cattle raid, Fergus repeatedly entered battle with Caladbolg,\n                    but Queen Medb or circumstances often prevented him from using its full power\n                    against the Ulstermen - particularly Cu Chulainn. In their climactic duel,\n                    Fergus agreed to yield to Cu Chulainn in exchange for a future favor, rather\n                    than use Caladbolg to kill his beloved foster-son.",
