  "longDescription": "Nectar (Greek: νέκταρ) is the sacred drink of the Olympian gods, typically paired with ambrosia (divine food). Unlike mortal beverages, nectar possesses supernatural properties—it sustains the gods' immortality, heals wounds, and grants divine vitality. The drink was served at divine feasts on Mount Olympus, often by Hebe (goddess of youth) or Ganymede (cupbearer of Zeus). When rare mortals tasted nectar, it could confer temporary immortality or divine qualities, though full consumption by mortals could prove dangerous. The etymology suggests 'death-overcoming' (nek- death, tar- overcoming), emphasizing its life-sustaining nature. Nectar flowed like honey or wine, golden and sweet, sometimes described as fragrant like flowers. Its presence marked the boundary between mortal and divine existence.",

The beverage represents divine joy, celebration, and the transcendent pleasures of godhood. Nectar's golden color links it to sunlight, divinity, and incorruptibility. Its sweetness suggests the perfection of divine existence compared to mortal suffering. The act of gods drinking together at symposia mirrors human communal dining but on an eternal, perfect scale—emphasizing that gods experience a higher version of human joys. Nectar's healing properties show divine power flowing into matter to restore and perfect.",
