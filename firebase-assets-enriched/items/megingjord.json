Mjolnir\n                    provides the striking power, Jarngreipr (the iron gloves) allow him to grip the hammer's\n                    short handle (shortened due to Loki's interference during its forging), and Megingjord\n                    provides the raw strength to wield these divine implements against the mightiest foes.\n                \n\n                \n                    \"Thor owns also Megingjord, and when he girds himself with it his divine strength is doubled.\"\n                    — Prose Edda, Gylfaginning\n                \n\n                Encounters with Giants\n                \n                    Thor's enemies included the frost giants of Jotunheim and the cosmic serpent Jormungandr.\n                    In battles against these primordial forces, Thor required every advantage. Megingjord's\n                    strength-doubling was not mere enhancement but necessity when facing beings of cosmic power\n                    like Hrungnir, the mightiest of all giants, or during his destined final battle with the\n                    World Serpent at Ragnarok.\n                \n\n                Symbolism\n                \n                    Megingjord symbolizes the concentration and focusing of power. In Norse warrior culture,\n                    the act of girding oneself for battle was significant and ritualistic. Thor's belt represents\n                    the transformation from ordinary state to battle-ready fury, the channeling of divine might\n                    for its intended purpose: the protection of gods and humans against chaos.",
