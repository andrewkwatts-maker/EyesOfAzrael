  "longDescription": "Sake (酒), also known as O-miki (御神酒, 'honored sacred sake') in ritual contexts, is sacred rice wine that plays a central role in Shinto worship and Japanese mythology. According to legend, sake brewing was taught to humanity by the kami. The beverage is considered a gift from the gods and a medium for communication between the human and divine realms. Sake is offered daily at Shinto shrines, used in purification ceremonies, wedding rites, groundbreaking ceremonies, and seasonal festivals. The drink appears in numerous myths: Susanoo used sake to intoxicate the eight-headed serpent Yamata-no-Orochi before slaying it; sake features in agricultural festivals honoring the rice harvest; and it is consumed during kagura (sacred dance) performances. The brewing process itself is considered sacred, with brewers observing ritual purity. Sake represents the transformation of rice (gift of the kami) into divine nectar, symbolizing the connection between agriculture, spirituality, and community.",

In Shinto practice, sake is offered to deities at shrines, consumed during rituals to receive divine blessings, and shared communally to strengthen social and spiritual bonds. The drink's intoxicating properties are seen as allowing communion with the divine realm. Sake is essential in life cycle events (births, weddings, funerals), agricultural festivals, and purification ceremonies. The toast 'Kanpai!' derives from ritual sake drinking."
