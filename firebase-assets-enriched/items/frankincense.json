  "longDescription": "Frankincense (Hebrew: לְבוֹנָה levonah, meaning 'white') is a precious aromatic resin obtained from Boswellia trees native to Arabia and East Africa. In Jewish tradition, frankincense was a key ingredient in the sacred Temple incense (Ketoret) and was burned on the golden altar twice daily. Its pure white appearance and sweet fragrance made it the perfect symbol of purity and divine worship. Frankincense was also placed on the showbread in the Temple and offered with certain grain offerings. The substance was so valuable it was considered a fitting gift for kings and deities, as seen when the Magi brought it to the infant Jesus.",
