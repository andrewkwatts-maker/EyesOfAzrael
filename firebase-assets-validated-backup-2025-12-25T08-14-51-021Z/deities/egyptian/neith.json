    "worship": "Neith's primary cult centerwasatSais (modern Sa el-Hagar)in the western Nile Delta, which served as Egypt's capital during the 26th Dynasty (664-525 BCE). Her temple there, called \"Hwt-Nit\" (House of Neith),wasone of Egypt's most important religious sites. According totradition, Sais also contained a hidden tomb ofOsirisand a sacred lake where his resurrection mysteries were performed annually. Other worship sites includedEsna (Iunyt)in Upper Egypt where shewashonored alongside Khnum and Heka, temples throughout the Delta region, and shrines in royal capitals where pharaohs sought her wisdom for matters of state. The Feast of the Lamps (Festival of Neith):Herodotus records a major festival at Sais where devotees lit countless lamps throughout the night, creating a \"sea of lights.\" This celebrated Neith as the primordial light-bringer who illuminated the darkness of Nun and brought forth creation. The lamps symbolized both the light of wisdom and the first light of creation. This festival later influenced Greco-Roman lamp festivals and may have contributed to various \"festival of lights\"traditions. The Mysteries ofOsirisat Sais:Sacred mysteries depictingOsiris's death and resurrection were performed at night on the sacred lake at Neith's temple. Herodotus considered these too sacred to describe in detail. These mysteries connected Neith's creative powers (bringing forthlifefrom the primordial waters) with resurrection themes (bringing forth renewedlifefrom death). Initiates underwent ritual rebirth, echoing both cosmiccreationand personal transformation. Royal Coronation Rites:Pharaohs, particularly those of Lower Egyptian origin, includedinvocationsto Neith in coronation ceremonies. She blessed the Red Crown (Deshret) of Lower Egypt andwascalled upon to grant the king wisdom in judgment and strength in defendingMa'at. Her role as \"Opener of the Ways\" made her essential to inaugurating new reigns. Offeringsto Neith reflected her multiple aspects:weapons(bows, arrows, shields dedicated by warriors and hunters),woven goods(fine linens, textiles, representing her weaving aspect),the first kill from hunts(acknowledging her as mistress of the hunt),incense and myrrh(for funerary rites),water from the Nile(representing primordial Nun),lamps and torches(light against darkness),written petitions for judgment(seeking her wisdom in disputes), andcow's milk(honoring her nurturing mother aspect). Weavers offered their finest work, seeking her blessing on their craft. Neithwasinvoked for protection in war, wisdom in judgment, skill in crafts, and safe passage to theafterlife: Warriors before battle:\"Neith, Mistress of the Bow, guide my hand. Let my aim be true as yours is true. Let my courage be strong as yours is strong. Defend Egyptthroughmy arm.\" Weavers at their looms:\"Neith who weaves the world, bless the work of my hands. As you wove the cosmos with perfection, let my threads be strong and my patterns beautiful. Let my work serveMa'atas your great weaving does.\"",
    "mythology": "Neith'smythologyreveals her as one of the oldest deities in the Egyptian pantheon, with her nature encompassing seemingly contradictory aspects—she is both virgin and mother, both warrior and weaver, both creator and destroyer."
