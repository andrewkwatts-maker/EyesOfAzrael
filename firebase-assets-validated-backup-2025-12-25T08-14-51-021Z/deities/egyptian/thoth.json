Grant me skill in writing, clarity in thought,powerin my words. Make my hieroglyphs perfect, my calculations true. As you recorded the judgment of the gods, so make my records accurate and enduring.\" Students prayed:\"Thoth, open my mind to wisdom. Grant me understanding of sacred knowledge. Make me swift in learning, retentive in memory, skilled in all arts.
