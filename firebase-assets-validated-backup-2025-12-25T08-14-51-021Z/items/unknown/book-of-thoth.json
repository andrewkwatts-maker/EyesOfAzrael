      "content": "The most famous myth about the Book of Thoth comes from the Demotic tales of Setne\n                    Khaemwas, a historical prince and high priest of Ptah who became legendary for his\n                    magical knowledge. In the story, Setne learned that the book had already been found\n                    by a previous seeker, the prince Naneferkaptah, and lay with him in his tomb.\n                \n                \n                    Naneferkaptah told Setne his tragic tale: how he had braved the Nile's depths, defeated\n                    the serpent guardian, and obtained the book. But Thoth's vengeance was swift. Naneferkaptah's\n                    wife and son both died, and he himself drowned, the book remaining with his body in death.\n                \n                \n                    Setne took the book anyway, but suffered such supernatural torments that he was forced\n                    to return it to the tomb. The tale serves as a warning: divine knowledge is not meant\n                    for mortals, and those who seek to steal the gods' secrets will pay a terrible price.",
