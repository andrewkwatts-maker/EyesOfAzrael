But the physician Dian Cecht crafted him a hand of silver, and later Dian Cecht's son made him a hand of flesh. Nuada embodies the principle of rightful sovereignty and the sacred relationship between king and land. His silver hand is a symbol of both limitation overcome and the price of leadership.",
