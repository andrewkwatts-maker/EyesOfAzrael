  "longDescription": "Paimpont Forest, Brittany, France The Forest of Broceliande is the legendary enchanted woodland of Arthurian romance, where Merlin\n                was imprisoned by the Lady of the Lake, where the fairy Viviane was born, and where knights of\n                the Round Table sought adventure among its magical groves. Today identified with the Forest of\n                Paimpont in central Brittany, this ancient woodland has been associated with the Arthurian\n                legends since at least the 12th century, when poets like Chretien de Troyes and the anonymous\n                authors of the Vulgate Cycle set their magical tales within its bounds. The forest remains a\n                place of pilgrimage for those seeking the living memory of Camelot and the old Celtic magic\n                that predates the medieval romances.",
