  "longDescription": "Mount Parnassus, Central Greece Delphi was the most important oracle in the ancient Greek world, consulted on matters of state,\n                war, colonization, and personal destiny for over a thousand years. Perched on the slopes of\n                Mount Parnassus, overlooking the Gulf of Corinth, this sacred site was considered the \"omphalos\"\n                or navel of the world. According to myth, Zeus released two eagles from opposite ends of the\n                earth, and they met at Delphi, marking it as the world's center. The oracle's pronouncements,\n                delivered through the Pythia priestess, shaped the course of Greek history and influenced\n                decisions from Athens to Asia Minor.",
