For five days, the Greek world paused in sacred truce (ekecheiria) as athletes,\nspectators, and pilgrims gathered to witness human excellence dedicated to divine glory. The games combined religious ritual, artistic\nperformance, and physical contests, embodying the Greek ideal of kalokagathia\n(beauty and goodness united).",
