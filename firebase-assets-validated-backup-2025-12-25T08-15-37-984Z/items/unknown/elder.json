      "symbolism": "Elder embodies the liminal nature of sacred space - it grows on boundaries (between fields, at crossroads, on property edges) and represents the threshold between human and spirit realms. The tree's guardian spirit (Elder Mother/Freyja) represents the idea that nature is ensouled and must be approached with respect. Elder's dual nature - protective yet dangerous, healing yet poisonous if misused - reflects the Norse understanding that sacred power requires proper relationship and protocol. The tree's association with Freyja connects it to seidr (Norse magic), sexuality, death, and transformation.",

  "longDescription": "The Elder tree (Sambucus nigra) holds powerful and ambivalent status in Norse and Germanic mythology, associated with both protection and danger, life and death, blessing and curse. In Norse tradition, Elder was sacred to Freyja (or in some traditions, the goddess Hylde-Moer, the 'Elder Mother'). The tree was believed to house protective spirits, particularly the Elder Mother who guarded the tree and would bring misfortune to anyone who harmed it without permission. Elder wood was paradoxically both protective and dangerous - branches could ward off evil spirits and lightning, but cutting the tree without ritual permission could bring curses. The tree grew on boundaries and liminal spaces, marking the threshold between the human world and the realm of spirits. Elder's flowers and berries had medicinal and magical properties, used in healing, protection spells, and rituals. The tree's hollow stems were used to make flutes and whistles believed to summon spirits.",
