## Archaeological Dating Methods

### Chronological Framework

**Synchronization with Egypt:**
- Mesopotamian king lists compared with Egyptian records
- Treaty mentions and diplomatic correspondence
- Astronomical observations (rare but precise)
- Solar eclipses mentioned in records

**Radiocarbon Dating (14C):**
- Applicable to organic materials from sites
- Clay tablets: can date baked clay
- Seeds, wood, bone: directly carbon-14 datable
- Margin of error: ±50-100 years typical

**Stratigraphic Excavation:**
- Layer-by-layer excavation
- Each layer = specific time period
- Artifacts within layers datable by context
- Broken pottery allows chronological gaps to be identified

**King Lists:**
- Sumerian King List records reign lengths
- Can calculate approximate dates
- Intersects with Egyptian chronology
- Provides relative dating framework

### Current Chronology (Academic Consensus)

**Long Chronology vs Short Chronology debate:**

**Long Chronology:**
- Hammurabi: 1848-1806 BCE
- Favored by some scholars
- Based on higher king list numbers

**Short Chronology:**
- Hammurabi: 1792-1750 BCE
- Currently more widely accepted
- Aligns better with Egyptian records
- Used in this document

**Margin of Error:**
- Dates c. 2000 BCE: ±50-75 years
- Dates c. 1000 BCE: ±25-50 years
- Dates after 600 BCE: ±10-25 years
- Earlier periods: larger uncertainty
