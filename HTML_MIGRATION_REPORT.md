## Next Steps

1. **Review** `html-migration-backlog.json` for prioritized migration list
2. **Run migration** on high-priority files first (priority 8-10)
3. **Verify** Firebase assets are complete before deleting HTML files
4. **Update** any incomplete Firebase assets
5. **Clean up** HTML files once Firebase migration is confirmed

## Notes

- Firebase checks were skipped (use --check-firebase to enable)
- Infrastructure pages are excluded from migration
- Priority is calculated based on asset type and content richness
- Always verify in Firebase before deleting HTML files
