  "historicalMetadata": {
    "historicalDevelopment": { ... },

}
```

## Usage Scenarios

### Academic Research
```
"According to the Foundational text Bhagavad Gita (2.2-2.25),
Krishna as Vishnu avatar teaches Arjuna about dharma. The
Bhagavata Purana (Major secondary source) elaborates on
Krishna's childhood miracles and pastimes, which became
central to later bhakti movements."
```

### Spiritual Practice
```
Krishna practitioners following Gaudiya Vaishnavism should:
- Recite primary mantra: "Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya"
- Study Foundational texts: Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavata Purana
- Observe festival: Janmashtami (Krishna's birth)
- Practice: Emotional bhakti devotion, Radha-Krishna meditation
- Chakra focus: Anahata (heart), center of love and devotion
```

### Religious Education
```
Timeline: From Epic period (Mahabharata, c. 500 BCE-500 CE),
through Puranic period (500-1500 CE with Bhagavata Purana
focus), to modern movements (ISKCON, 1960s onward).
Sectarian variations: Sri Vaishnavism (South), Vallabha
(West), Gaudiya (East), emphasizing different theological
aspects while unified in Krishna devotion.

## Key Insights Provided

### Hindu Mythology Evolution
- **Brahma**: Conceptually important (Vedic Prajapati) but personally minor (few temples)
- **Shiva**: Transformed from fierce (Vedic Rudra) to supreme consciousness (tantric peak)
- **Vishnu**: Elevated from minor solar deity to supreme lord with avatar theology
- **Krishna**: Evolved from regional hero to cosmic being embodying divine love
- **Development Pattern**: Vedic ritual → Upanishadic philosophy → Epic narrative → Puranic elaboration → Tantric esotericism → Modern devotion

### Buddhist Mythology Evolution
- **Buddha**: Changed from exemplary human (Early Buddhism) to cosmic principle (Mahayana)
- **Bodhisattvas**: Emerged in Mahayana as compassionate helpers (vs. individual enlightenment focus)
- **Avalokiteshvara**: Shows cultural adaptation (male in Sanskrit, female in East Asia)
- **Regional Variation**: Different schools emphasize different aspects (Theravada historical focus vs. Mahayana cosmic view)
- **Tantric Integration**: Tibetan Buddhism combined esoteric practice with Buddhist philosophy

### Universal Patterns
- **Philosophical Elevation**: Deities often start practical, become philosophical principles
- **Sectarian Development**: Major deities become centers of distinct theological schools
- **Geographic Expansion**: Traditions adapt to local cultures, creating regional variations
- **Gender Flexibility**: Deities can manifest as masculine, feminine, or both (representing different aspects)
- **Textual Accumulation**: Each period adds new texts and interpretations, creating layers of meaning
- **Living Traditions**: Not historical artifacts but active practices with billions of practitioners
