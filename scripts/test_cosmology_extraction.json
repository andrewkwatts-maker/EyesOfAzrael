    "longDescription": "When mortals die in Greek mythology, their psyche (soul/shade) descends to the Underworld ruled by Hades and Persephone. The journey involves crossing treacherous rivers, facing judgment, and eternal residence in one of several realms based on one's life. Unlike many traditions, most souls face neither eternal bliss nor torment, but rather a dim existence in the Asphodel Meadows. When death comes, the psyche (soul or shade) separates from the body. Thanatos (Death) or his gentler brother Hypnos (Sleep) may appear to escort the soul. The body must receive proper burial rites—washing, wrapping, and placement of an obol (coin) in the mouth to pay Charon the ferryman. Without burial, souls wander the shores of the river Styx for a hundred years, unable to enter Hades proper. Funeral rites include mourning, offerings at the grave, and periodic libations to honor the dead. The Greeks feared becoming an unburied ghost, trapped between worlds. Heroes might receive elaborate tombs and cult worship, while ordinary people were cremated or buried with grave goods for the journey ahead.",
