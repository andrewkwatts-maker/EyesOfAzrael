  "description": "Yggdrasil (Old Norse: Yggdrasill) is the enormous ash tree that stands at the center of the Norse cosmos, connecting all Nine Realms. The tree is not merely large—it is described as stretching across all of existence, with branches that reach into the heavens and roots that delve into the deepest underworld. It is both the physical and spiritual axis mundi (center of the world) around which all cosmic activity revolves.",
