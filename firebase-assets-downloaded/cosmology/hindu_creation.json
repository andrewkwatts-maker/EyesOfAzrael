  "description": "Hindu creation is not a single event but an eternal cycle. The universe emerges from the cosmic\n                waters, flourishes for billions of years, then dissolves back into the unmanifest, only to be\n                reborn again. Creation, preservation, and destruction dance in endless rhythm.",
