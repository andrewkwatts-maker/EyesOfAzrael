  "description": "Christian theology teaches that all humanity stands in need of salvation because of sin. Since the fall of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, humanity has been separated from God by sin, which the Bible describes as both inherited guilt (original sin) and personal transgressions. Sin results in spiritual death and separation from God's presence, making salvation necessary for restoration.",
