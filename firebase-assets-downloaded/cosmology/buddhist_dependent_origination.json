  "displayName": "Dependent Origination - The Chain of Causation",
  "description": "Dependent Origination (Sanskrit: Pratityasamutpada; Pali: Paticca-samuppada) stands as one of the most profound and central doctrines in Buddhist philosophy, revealing the fundamental law that governs all conditioned phenomena. This teaching explains that all phenomena arise in dependence upon multiple causes and conditions - nothing exists independently, inherently, or permanently. The doctrine is most famously expressed through the Twelve Nidanas (links), a chain of causation that explains how suffering and the cycle of rebirth (samsara) arise from ignorance and how liberation (nirvana) can be achieved by breaking this chain. The Buddha declared that to understand Dependent Origination is to understand the Dharma itself.",
  "origins": {
    "enlightenmentRealization": "According to Buddhist tradition, the Buddha realized the truth of Dependent Origination during his enlightenment under the Bodhi Tree. In the third watch of the night, he perceived the chain of causation that perpetuates suffering and the means to break free from it.",
    "initialHesitation": "The doctrine was considered so profound that the Buddha initially hesitated to teach it, fearing no one would understand. The Brahma Sahampati convinced him that beings with 'little dust in their eyes' could comprehend this liberating truth.",
    "scriptualFoundation": "The teaching appears extensively throughout the Pali Canon, particularly in the Samyutta Nikaya (Connected Discourses), and is central to all Buddhist schools."
