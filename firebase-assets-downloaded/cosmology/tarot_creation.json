  "description": "In Hermetic cosmology, creation is not a single event but an ongoing process of divine emanation—\n                infinite light progressively condensing into finite form. The Lightning Flash traces the path of\n                divine energy as it descends through the ten Sefirot of the Tree of Life, from pure unity (Keter)\n                to material manifestation (Malkuth). This is the \"descent into matter,\" the divine becoming world.",
