    "description": "When mortals die in Greek mythology, their psyche (soul/shade) descends to the Underworld ruled by Hades\n                and Persephone. The journey involves crossing treacherous rivers, facing judgment, and eternal residence\n                in one of several realms based on one's life. Unlike many traditions, most souls face neither eternal bliss\n                nor torment, but rather a dim existence in the Asphodel Meadows.",
