      "content": "The concept of karma (Pali: kamma) predates Buddhism, appearing in the Vedic tradition and Upanishads. However, the Buddha radically reinterpreted karma, emphasizing intention (cetana) as the defining factor rather than ritual action. In his teaching, karma is not fate or predestination but a natural law of moral causality. The Buddha declared: 'It is volition (cetana) that I call karma; for having willed, one acts through body, speech, and mind.' This psychological understanding distinguished Buddhist karma from the more ritualistic Brahmanical concept."

    "mythology": {
      "title": "Buddhist Teaching",
      "content": "In Buddhist cosmology, karma is the engine driving samsara, the endless cycle of death and rebirth. Beings are reborn in one of six realms (gods, asuras, humans, animals, hungry ghosts, hell beings) according to their accumulated karma. The Buddha taught that while we cannot change past karma, we have complete freedom in the present moment to shape our future. The path to liberation involves purifying karma through ethical conduct (sila), developing meditation (samadhi) to understand the mind's workings, and cultivating wisdom (panna) to see through the illusion of a permanent self that accumulates karma. An Arhat or Buddha, having eliminated craving and delusion, creates no new karma and is liberated from the cycle."
    },
    "attributes": {
      "title": "Attributes",
      "content": "Buddhist karma has several distinctive characteristics. First, it is natural and impersonal - not administered by any god or cosmic judge, but operating through cause and effect like gravity. Second, intention is paramount - an accidental harm produces minimal karmic result compared to deliberate cruelty. Third, karma is not deterministic - while past actions condition present circumstances, current choices remain free. Fourth, karma can be purified through confession, merit-making, meditation, and wisdom. Fifth, collective karma affects groups and nations, not just individuals. The Buddha taught that the workings of karma are one of four 'imponderables' (acinteyya) that cannot be fully comprehended by ordinary minds and should not be obsessively analyzed."

    "culturalRole": {
      "title": "Cultural Role",
      "content": "Karma forms the ethical foundation of Buddhist societies across Asia. It encourages personal responsibility, as each person creates their own destiny through their choices. The doctrine inspires merit-making practices - generosity, temple building, supporting monks, releasing animals - believed to create positive karma. In Theravada countries, karma explains social hierarchies while also motivating compassion, as all beings suffer according to past actions. Mahayana Buddhism developed the concept of 'transferring merit' to help others' karmic situation. The understanding of karma has influenced Asian legal systems, medical explanations of illness, and attitudes toward suffering. In the modern era, karma remains central to Buddhist psychology and ethics, offering a framework for understanding behavior and cultivating positive change."

  "description": "Karma (Pali: kamma) is the Buddhist doctrine of moral causality, teaching that intentional actions of body, speech, and mind generate consequences that shape future experience and rebirth. Unlike fatalistic interpretations, Buddhist karma emphasizes free will in the present moment while acknowledging that past actions condition current circumstances. The quality of karma - wholesome (kusala) or unwholesome (akusala) - depends on the intention behind the action, rooted in either wisdom and compassion or the 'three poisons' of greed, hatred, and delusion. Karma drives the cycle of samsara, determining rebirth among the six realms, but can be transcended through the Noble Eightfold Path leading to nirvana, where no new karma is generated and the cycle ends.",
