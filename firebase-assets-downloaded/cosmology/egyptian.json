Death was not an ending\n                but a transformation—a dangerous journey through the Duat (underworld) requiring preparation, knowledge, magical\n                protection, and moral worthiness. Those who succeeded became eternal spirits dwelling in paradise. Those who\n                failed faced oblivion.",
