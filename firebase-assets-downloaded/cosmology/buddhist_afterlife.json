  "description": "In Buddhism, death is not an ending but a transition. The consciousness exits the dying body and\n                enters the bardo—an intermediate state between lives—where it experiences visions based on karma.\n                After up to 49 days, the consciousness is drawn to rebirth in one of six realms according to its\n                accumulated karma. Only nirvana offers true liberation from this endless cycle.",
