  "description": "The Duat (Ancient Egyptian: dwꜣt) is the primordial Egyptian underworld, a vast realm of darkness, danger, and profound transformation that exists beneath the earth and beyond the western horizon. Every night, the sun god Ra must navigate through this treacherous domain in his solar barque, accompanied by a retinue of protective deities who defend him against the chaos serpent Apophis. The Duat is structured as a twelve-hour nocturnal journey, each hour presenting distinct challenges, gates guarded by fearsome entities, and mystical landscapes that the deceased soul must learn to traverse. The journey begins at the western horizon where the sun sets (symbolizing death) and culminates at the eastern horizon where Ra is reborn at dawn (symbolizing resurrection and eternal life). For the souls of the deceased, successfully navigating the Duat was essential for reaching the Fields of Aaru and achieving immortality. The Book of the Dead, Amduat, Book of Gates, and Book of Caverns all provide detailed maps and magical spells to guide souls through this perilous realm, making the Duat central to Egyptian funerary beliefs and the concept of cosmic order (Ma'at).",
