  "description": "The Duat is the Egyptian underworld, a realm of darkness, danger, and transformation that must be traversed\n                each night by Ra in his solar barque and by the souls of the deceased seeking eternal life. The journey through\n                the Duat's twelve hours represents the sun's passage from west (death/sunset) to east (rebirth/dawn), mirroring\n                the soul's journey from death to resurrection.",
