    "description": "In Hindu cosmology, death is not an ending but a transition. The eternal soul (Atman) migrates through\n                countless lifetimes, driven by karma, until achieving moksha - liberation from the cycle itself and\n                union with the divine. This is the journey every soul undertakes through the vast expanse of time.",
