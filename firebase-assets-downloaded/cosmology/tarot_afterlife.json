  "description": "If the Lightning Flash describes the soul's descent into matter, the Serpent Path (or Path of Return)\n                describes its ascent back to source. This is the Great Work (Magnum Opus) of Hermetic alchemy—\n                transforming the base metal of ordinary consciousness into the gold of enlightened awareness.\n                Through study, practice, and initiation, consciousness climbs the Tree of Life from material\n                awareness (Malkuth) to divine union (Keter).",
