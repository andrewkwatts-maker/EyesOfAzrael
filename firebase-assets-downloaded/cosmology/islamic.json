    "description": "Islamic eschatology presents one of the most detailed and comprehensive afterlife journeys in world religion, tracing the soul's path from the moment of death through multiple realms to its eternal destination. When a person dies, the Angel of Death (Azrael/Malak al-Mawt) extracts the soul - gently for the righteous, violently for the wicked. The soul then enters Barzakh, the intermediate realm between worlds, where it awaits the Day of Judgment (Yawm al-Qiyamah). In the grave, the angels Munkar and Nakir question the deceased about their faith. On the Day of Resurrection, the angel Israfil blows the trumpet (Sur) to raise all souls for judgment. Each person receives their Book of Deeds (Kitab al-A'mal) - in the right hand for the saved, in the left for the damned. Deeds are weighed on the Mizan (divine scales), and Prophet Muhammad may intercede (Shafa'ah) for believers. Finally, all must cross the Sirat bridge, sharper than a sword and thinner than a hair, stretched over Jahannam (Hell). The righteous cross swiftly to Jannah (Paradise), while sinners fall into the seven-layered fires below. This cosmological framework emphasizes divine justice, personal accountability, and the eternal consequences of earthly choices.",

    "description": "Islamic cosmology presents a profound creation narrative centered on Allah's absolute sovereignty and creative power. Creation began when Allah spoke the divine command 'Kun!' (Be!), bringing all existence into being from absolute nothingness (creation ex nihilo). According to the Quran, Allah created the heavens and the earth in six 'ayyam' (periods or days), though Islamic scholars note these are divine measurements, not 24-hour days. The sequence began with the creation of water, upon which rested Allah's Throne (al-Arsh). From primordial smoke (dukhan), the seven heavens and seven earths were formed. The angels were created from light (nur), the jinn from smokeless fire (nar), and finally humanity from clay (tin). Adam, the first human, was created as Allah's khalifa (vicegerent/steward) on Earth, given knowledge of the names of all things, and commanded the angels to prostrate before him. Iblis (Satan) refused out of pride, beginning the cosmic struggle between guidance and misguidance. The creation narrative emphasizes tawhid (divine oneness), humanity's special status and responsibility, and the purposeful design underlying all existence. Every creature glorifies Allah (tasbih), though humans may not perceive it.",

    "description": "Tawhid (Arabic: tawhid, 'making one' or 'unifying') is the foundational principle of Islamic theology and cosmology - the absolute oneness and uniqueness of Allah. It represents not merely monotheism but a comprehensive worldview where Allah alone is the ultimate reality, the sole Creator, Sustainer, and Sovereign of all existence. Tawhid has three classical dimensions: Tawhid al-Rububiyyah (oneness of Lordship - Allah alone creates, sustains, and governs), Tawhid al-Uluhiyyah (oneness of worship - Allah alone deserves worship), and Tawhid al-Asma wa'l-Sifat (oneness of names and attributes - Allah's attributes are unique and perfect). This doctrine shapes Islamic cosmology by establishing that nothing in creation shares in Allah's divine nature - there is an absolute distinction between Creator (al-Khaliq) and creation (makhluq). Shirk (associating partners with Allah) is considered the gravest sin precisely because it violates tawhid. The shahada ('There is no god but Allah') encapsulates this principle. Tawhid influences every aspect of Islamic thought: metaphysics (reality flows from One source), ethics (submission to One will), aesthetics (geometric patterns reflecting divine unity), and eschatology (return to the One). Sufis emphasize tawhid al-wujudi (unity of existence), where all reality is a manifestation of the One Divine Being.",
