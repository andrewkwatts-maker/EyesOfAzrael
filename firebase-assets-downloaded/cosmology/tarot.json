  "description": "The cosmology underlying Western esoteric tarot is the Kabbalistic Tree of Life (Etz Chaim), as interpreted and developed by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and subsequent magical traditions. This cosmic map depicts reality as a series of emanations flowing from the infinite divine source (Ain Soph) through ten spheres (Sefirot) connected by twenty-two paths, each path associated with a Hebrew letter and a Major Arcana card. The Tree represents both the structure of the universe and the structure of the human soul, following the Hermetic principle 'As above, so below.' Creation occurs through the Lightning Flash - divine energy descending from Keter (Crown) through each successive Sefirah to Malkuth (Kingdom, material world). The spiritual journey reverses this, ascending the Tree through the Serpent Path of initiation and return. The Four Worlds of Kabbalah (Atziluth, Briah, Yetzirah, Assiah) correspond to the four suits of the Minor Arcana and the four elements. This cosmological framework transforms tarot from a mere fortune-telling device into a comprehensive map of consciousness, a meditation tool, and a guide for spiritual evolution. The Major Arcana, when arranged on the Tree's paths, reveals the initiatory journey from material consciousness to divine union - the Great Work of Hermetic alchemy.",
