  "description": "Buddhism uniquely teaches that there is no creation by a supreme deity. Instead, all phenomena arise\n                dependently through an endless chain of causes and conditions. Nothing possesses inherent,\n                independent existence. This teaching of Pratityasamutpada (Interdependent Origination) explains\n                both the arising of the universe and the perpetuation of suffering in the cycle of rebirth.",
