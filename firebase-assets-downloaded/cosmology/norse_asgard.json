  "description": "Asgard (Old Norse: Ásgarðr, \"enclosure of the Æsir\") is the celestial realm of the Aesir gods in Norse mythology. It sits at the top of Yggdrasil, the World Tree, and is one of the Nine Realms that make up the Norse cosmos. Unlike the Christian concept of Heaven as an eternal paradise, Asgard is a fortress—a place of strength and preparation for the final battle of Ragnarok.",
