  "description": "The Babylonian underworld was a dark, dreary realm beneath the earth where all the dead dwelled\n                regardless of their deeds in life. A place of dust and darkness, ruled by the fearsome goddess\n                Ereshkigal and her consort Nergal, from which no mortal could return. Here the dead existed as\n                shadowy echoes, stripped of vitality, clothed in feathers like birds, eating dust and clay."
