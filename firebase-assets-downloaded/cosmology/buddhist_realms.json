  "description": "The six realms of existence (Sanskrit: gati or bhava) are the destinations for rebirth in Buddhist cosmology, depicted in the Bhavachakra (Wheel of Becoming). These realms are driven by karma—the consequences of intentional actions—and the three root poisons: greed, hatred, and ignorance.",

    "structure": "Six realms arranged in a wheel (Bhavachakra) representing different states of rebirth. Organized hierarchically from heavenly realms (gods/demi-gods) through human and animal realms to hellish and hungry-ghost realms. Each realm populated according to karma.",
