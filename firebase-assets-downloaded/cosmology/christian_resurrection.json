  "description": "The resurrection of Jesus Christ is the cornerstone of Christian faith. Three days after His crucifixion and burial, Jesus rose bodily from the dead, conquering death and vindicating His claims to be the Son of God. The tomb was found empty, the grave clothes left behind, and Jesus appeared alive to numerous witnesses over forty days—to Mary Magdalene, to the disciples, to more than five hundred people at once.",
