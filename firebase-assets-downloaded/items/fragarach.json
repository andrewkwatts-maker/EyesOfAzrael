No lie could be spoken while under its\n                    influence, and no question could be evaded. This made Fragarach not merely a weapon of war\n                    but an instrument of divine justice, capable of settling disputes, uncovering treachery, and\n                    ensuring that oaths were honored."

      "content": "Forging in the Otherworld\n                \n                    According to the oldest traditions, Fragarach was forged by the gods themselves in one of the\n                    four mystical cities - specifically Findias (or Finias) - before the Tuatha De Danann descended\n                    upon Ireland. The smith who created it was said to have captured the essence of the winds in\n                    the blade, giving it power over the element of air itself. The metal was quenched in sacred\n                    waters and blessed with enchantments that would never fade.\n                \n                \n                    Manannan mac Lir, as lord of the Otherworld and guardian of the passages between realms,\n                    became the sword's first wielder among the gods. He used Fragarach to defend the borders\n                    between the mortal world and the realms beyond, ensuring that neither the living nor the\n                    dead could pass without proper authority.\n                \n\n                Transfer to Lugh\n                \n                    When Lugh Lamhfada - the young god who mastered every art and craft - came to take his place\n                    among the Tuatha De Danann, Manannan bestowed upon him several gifts essential for the coming\n                    battle against the Fomorians. Among these was Fragarach, which Lugh would wield alongside\n                    his famous spear in the Second Battle of Mag Tuired.\n                \n                \n                    In that great conflict, Lugh used Fragarach to devastating effect against the Fomorian\n                    champions. The sword's power to cut through any armor negated the magical protections that\n                    many Fomorian warriors relied upon, while its truth-compelling properties helped Lugh\n                    identify traitors and ensure the loyalty of his forces.\n                \n\n                Legacy Through the Ages\n                \n                    After the age of the Tuatha De Danann, Fragarach passed through various hands. Some\n                    traditions claim it was eventually wielded by Conn of the Hundred Battles, the legendary\n                    High King of Ireland, and later by his descendants. The sword became associated with\n                    legitimate kingship - only a true ruler, chosen by the gods, could wield Fragarach\n                    without being harmed by its power."

      "content": "Manannan mac Lir\n                \n                    The sea god and ruler of the Otherworld was Fragarach's original wielder. Manannan is one of\n                    the most complex figures in Celtic mythology - simultaneously a god of the sea, a psychopomp\n                    who guides souls to the afterlife, a trickster, and a guardian of the boundaries between\n                    worlds. His possession of Fragarach symbolized his role as the keeper of cosmic order and\n                    the one who ensures that truth prevails over deception.\n                \n                \n                    Manannan's other famous possessions included his crane bag (containing magical treasures),\n                    his horse Enbarr that could travel over sea as easily as land, and his ship Wave Sweeper\n                    that needed no sails or oars. Together with Fragarach, these items marked him as master of\n                    all the liminal spaces - sea, air, and the threshold between life and death.\n                \n\n                Lugh Lamhfada\n                \n                    Lugh \"of the Long Arm\" was the champion of the Tuatha De Danann and one of the greatest\n                    figures in Irish mythology. He was the master of every skill and craft - warrior, king,\n                    poet, harper, smith, sorcerer, and more. When Lugh arrived at the court of King Nuada to\n                    join the Tuatha De Danann, he demonstrated mastery of every art, earning him the title\n                    \"Samildanach\" (Equally Skilled in All Arts).\n                \n                \n                    Fragarach complemented Lugh's other weapons - his famous spear Gae Assail and his sling\n                    with which he slew Balor of the Evil Eye. Together, these weapons made Lugh virtually\n                    invincible and enabled him to lead the Tuatha De Danann to victory in their greatest battles."

      "content": "Symbol of Justice\n                \n                    Fragarach's truth-compelling power made it a symbol of divine justice in Celtic thought.\n                    The concept that truth could be enforced by divine power reflected the Celtic belief that\n                    cosmic order depended on honesty and the keeping of oaths. In a society where verbal\n                    contracts and sworn agreements formed the basis of law, a weapon that guaranteed truth\n                    represented the ultimate legal authority.\n                \n\n                The Four Treasures\n                \n                    As one of the Four Treasures of the Tuatha De Danann, Fragarach represented one of the\n                    four essential aspects of legitimate rule:\n                \n                \n                    The Stone of Fal: Confirmed the true king by crying out\n                    The Spear of Lugh: Guaranteed victory in battle\n                    The Cauldron of the Dagda: Provided endless sustenance\n                    Fragarach: Ensured justice and truth\n                \n                \n                    Together, these treasures embodied the requirements of Celtic kingship: divine selection,\n                    military prowess, abundance for the people, and just rule.\n                \n\n                Elemental Association\n                \n                    The Four Treasures were associated with the four classical elements, with Fragarach\n                    representing Air. This connection to the element of air manifested in the sword's power\n                    over wind but also in deeper symbolic meanings - air represents breath, speech, and truth.\n                    The sword of air was thus naturally the sword of truth-telling."
