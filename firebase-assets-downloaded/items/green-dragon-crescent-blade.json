He is worshipped as the God of\n                    War, patron of soldiers and martial artists, but also paradoxically as a god of\n                    literature and wealth.

The \"Green Dragon\" refers both to the azure-green\n                    color traditionally associated with the blade and to the dragon imagery that\n                    symbolizes power, wisdom, and divine favor in Chinese culture.\n                \n                \n                    According to the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, the blade weighed 82 jin\n                    (approximately 41 kilograms or 90 pounds in modern measurements).

While historically documented,\n                    Guan Yu's legend has grown far beyond historical records through centuries of\n                    storytelling, culminating in the 14th-century novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms.\n                \n                \n                    In both history and legend, Guan Yu is remembered as the paragon of loyalty and\n                    righteousness. His bond with Liu Bei and Zhang Fei - the famous \"Oath of the Peach\n                    Garden\" - became the model of sworn brotherhood.
