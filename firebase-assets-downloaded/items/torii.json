  "longDescription": "Torii (鳥居, literally 'bird perch') is the iconic gateway found at the entrance to Shinto shrines, marking the transition from the profane world to sacred space. While the exact origin of torii is debated, one tradition connects them to the myth of Amaterasu's cave. When the kami gathered to lure Amaterasu from the Heavenly Rock Cave, they assembled roosters (torinaga-naku-tori, 'long-crying birds') whose crowing would herald the dawn. The birds perched on a frame outside the cave, and this perch became the prototype for torii gates. Another theory suggests torii evolved from Indian torana gates or Korean hongsalmun, brought to Japan with Buddhism but adapted to Shinto use. Torii consist of two vertical pillars supporting two horizontal crossbeams, the upper one extending beyond the pillars. They are traditionally made from wood (often cypress or cedar) and painted vermillion red, though stone, concrete, and unpainted wood versions exist. Walking through a torii signifies entering kami territory, requiring respectful behavior. Multiple torii often lead to a shrine, creating a progressive sanctification. The most famous example is Fushimi Inari Taisha's thousands of vermillion torii creating tunnels up the mountain.",

The simplicity of the structure reflects Shinto aesthetics of natural beauty and unpretentious spirituality. Passing through multiple torii represents progressive purification and approach to the divine center.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Torii are the most recognizable symbol of Shinto and Japan itself. Tens of thousands exist throughout Japan, marking over 80,000 shrines and countless sacred natural sites. The torii emoji ⛩️ represents Japanese culture globally. Famous torii include: Itsukushima's 'floating' torii; Fushimi Inari's thousands of vermillion gates; Meiji Shrine's massive cypress torii. Torii appear in art, architecture, corporate logos, and popular culture. The gates mark the boundary for proper behavior—one should bow before passing through and show respect within shrine grounds. Modern Japanese maintain this ancient reverence when encountering torii."
