The young god accidentally broke off one of Amalthea's horns while playing.\n                \n                \n                    In gratitude for her care, Zeus blessed the broken horn with the power of inexhaustible\n                    plenty, so that it would always overflow with whatever food or drink its possessor desired.\n                    When Amalthea died, Zeus honored her further by placing her among the stars as Capella,\n                    and he used her hide to make his aegis shield.\n                \n\n                The River God Achelous\n                \n                    An alternative myth involves Heracles' battle with the river god Achelous for the hand of\n                    Deianira. During their wrestling match, Achelous transformed into a bull, but Heracles\n                    seized one of his horns and tore it off. The river god exchanged this horn for the\n                    original Cornucopia (or in some versions, nymphs filled the broken horn with flowers\n                    and fruits, creating the Cornucopia).\n                \n\n                \n                    \"The Naiads took it up and filled it with fruits and fragrant flowers, and hallowed it,\n                    and now the good Abundantia is enriched with my horn.\"\n                    — Ovid, Metamorphoses",
