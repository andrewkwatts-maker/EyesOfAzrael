When Wotan and Loge\n                    trick him into demonstrating its powers by transforming first into a dragon, then a toad,\n                    they capture him and seize both the Tarnhelm and the cursed Ring.\n                \n\n                Siegfried\n                \n                    After Siegfried slays the dragon Fafner (who had used the Tarnhelm to take dragon form\n                    and guard the treasure), the hero takes the helmet along with the Ring. The Woodbird\n                    advises him of the Tarnhelm's powers, which he later uses in his adventures.\n                \n\n                Gotterdammerung\n                \n                    The Tarnhelm enables much of the tragedy in the final opera. Siegfried, given a potion\n                    of forgetfulness, uses the helmet to assume Gunther's form and abduct Brunnhilde. This\n                    deception leads ultimately to Siegfried's murder and the cataclysmic end of the gods."
