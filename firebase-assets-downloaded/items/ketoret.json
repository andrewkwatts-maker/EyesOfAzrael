  "longDescription": "The Ketoret (Hebrew: קְטֹרֶת, literally 'that which rises in smoke') was the sacred incense offering burned twice daily on the golden altar in the Temple. Composed of eleven precisely measured ingredients, the Ketoret represented the unity of all Israel and the elevation of prayer to the divine realm. Its preparation required exact proportions and specific methods detailed in the Talmud. The mystical tradition teaches that each ingredient corresponds to different types of souls, and even the malodorous galbanum must be included, teaching that all of Israel—righteous and less righteous alike—must unite in worship. The privilege of offering the Ketoret was so great that priests participated in a lottery for the honor.",

In Kabbalah, the eleven ingredients correspond to the ten Sefirot plus Da'at (knowledge), creating a complete spiritual structure. The precise measurements teach the importance of precision and intention in divine service. The fragrance represents the sweetness of mitzvot and Torah study.",
      "culturalSignificance": "The Ketoret was considered the most precious Temple offering, more valuable than all other sacrifices. Its preparation required master knowledge passed down through priestly families, particularly the family of Avtinas who guarded the secret. After the Temple's destruction, reciting the Ketoret formula became a daily prayer in traditional Jewish liturgy. Kabbalists recite it for protection and spiritual elevation. The tradition of including galbanum has inspired countless teachings about accepting and including all Jews in communal life. Chassidic tradition teaches that studying the Ketoret brings prosperity and protection from plague, as it did when Aaron stopped a plague with incense (Numbers 17:11-13)."
