  "longDescription": "Mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris) is one of the most powerful herbs in Norse magical practice, associated with protection, prophetic visions, and crossing between worlds. The herb was used extensively in seidr—the shamanic magical tradition associated with Freyja and practiced by völvas (seeresses). Mugwort enhances psychic abilities, induces prophetic dreams, and aids spiritual travel between the Nine Realms. Warriors placed mugwort in their shoes for tirelessness on long journeys, reflecting its association with endurance and safe passage. The plant's silvery leaves were seen as holding lunar wisdom, connecting it to the hidden knowledge of the night. Mugwort smoke was used for purification and to prepare sacred spaces for divination and ritual work. As one of the Nine Sacred Herbs mentioned in various Northern European traditions, mugwort bridges the gap between the physical and spiritual worlds.",

The silvery backs of its leaves reflect lunar wisdom and hidden knowledge that reveals itself only to those who look from different angles. As a wayfarer's herb, it represents the spiritual journey of consciousness through different states and realms. Its association with women's mysteries and seidr connects it to the feminine path of magic through intuition and vision rather than force.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Mugwort was one of the most commonly used magical herbs in Norse and broader Northern European culture. Völvas likely used it as part of their professional practice of seidr divination. The herb's accessibility—growing wild throughout Scandinavia—made it available to all classes for protection and dreaming. Modern Norse pagans and practitioners of seidr use mugwort extensively for trance work, divination, and dream magic. The plant connects contemporary practice to ancient shamanic traditions that likely predate the Viking Age itself."
