  "longDescription": "Ginseng (人參, rénshēn, literally 'man-root') is a sacred medicinal herb central to Chinese medicine and Daoist alchemy. The root, which often resembles a human figure, is believed to contain concentrated life energy (qi) and possess extraordinary healing and rejuvenating properties. Wild ginseng, especially specimens aged hundreds of years, is considered supremely valuable and is believed to grant longevity, vitality, and spiritual power. In mythology, ginseng spirits can take human form and possess consciousness.",
