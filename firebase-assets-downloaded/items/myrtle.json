  "longDescription": "Myrtle (Myrtus communis) is an aromatic evergreen shrub with white flowers and dark purple-blue berries, sacred above all other plants to Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love and beauty. Native to the Mediterranean region, myrtle's fragrant leaves, delicate blossoms, and sweet-smelling oils made it the quintessential symbol of love, marriage, and immortality in ancient Greek and Roman culture. According to myth, when Aphrodite first emerged from the sea foam, she hid her nakedness behind a myrtle bush, forever linking the plant to the goddess. Brides wore myrtle wreaths as crowns, Olympic victors were crowned with myrtle, and the plant featured prominently in love magic, divination, and funeral rites. The plant's evergreen nature represented eternal love, its white flowers symbolized purity and beauty, and its berries represented fertility and abundance.",
