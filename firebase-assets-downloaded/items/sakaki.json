  "longDescription": "Sakaki (榊, Cleyera japonica) is the most sacred tree in Shinto, an evergreen species whose name combines the characters for 'tree' (木) and 'kami' (神), literally meaning 'kami tree' or 'tree of the gods.' According to the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, when Amaterasu hid herself in the Heavenly Rock Cave (Ama-no-Iwato) and plunged the world into darkness, the kami uprooted a sacred sakaki tree from Mount Kagu and hung upon it the Yata no Kagami (sacred mirror) and Yasakani no Magatama (sacred jewel). They placed the adorned tree outside the cave as part of their ritual to lure the sun goddess back. When Amaterasu emerged to see the magnificent tree and her own reflection in the mirror, light returned to the world. Because of this mythological role, sakaki branches are used in virtually all Shinto ceremonies. Priests wave sakaki branches (tamagushi) during purification rites, offerings, and blessings. The evergreen nature of sakaki symbolizes eternity and the unchanging presence of the kami. Sakaki creates a bridge between the human and divine realms.",

The tree's role in the Amaterasu myth makes it a symbol of restoration, hope, and the return of light. The act of offering a sakaki branch represents giving a part of divine creation back to its source. The zigzag shide papers attached to tamagushi represent lightning and the descent of kami.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Sakaki remains central to Shinto practice. Every shrine maintains sakaki for daily rituals. Florists supply fresh sakaki branches to homes for kamidana. The tree grows in shrine precincts and sacred groves throughout Japan. Harvesting sakaki is done with ritual respect. In areas where true sakaki doesn't grow, substitutes like hisakaki are used. The tamagushi offering ritual is performed at all major Shinto ceremonies: weddings, funerals, business openings, construction sites, and seasonal festivals. Modern Japanese maintain this ancient practice, ensuring continuity with mythological tradition."
