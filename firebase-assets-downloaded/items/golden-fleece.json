  "longDescription": "The Golden Fleece (Greek: χρυσόμαλλον δέρας) is the fleece of the divine ram Chrysomallos, sent by Zeus to rescue Phrixus and Helle from their murderous stepmother. After Phrixus sacrificed the ram to Zeus in gratitude, he hung the fleece in the sacred grove of Ares in Colchis, where it was guarded by a sleepless dragon. The fleece possessed magical properties, bringing prosperity and legitimacy to whoever possessed it. Jason's quest to retrieve the fleece became one of Greek mythology's greatest adventures, involving the Argonauts' perilous journey and his alliance with the sorceress Medea. The fleece symbolizes the ultimate prize, legitimate kingship, and divine favor.",

The ram flew the children away from Boeotia, but Helle\n                    fell into the sea (thereafter called the Hellespont) while Phrixus safely reached Colchis.\n                \n                \n                    In gratitude for his deliverance, Phrixus sacrificed the ram to Zeus and gave its golden\n                    fleece to King Aeetes of Colchis, who hung it in a sacred grove dedicated to Ares. There\n                    it remained, guarded by a sleepless dragon, until Jason's arrival.\n                \n\n                The Quest of the Argonauts\n                \n                    The voyage of Jason and the Argonauts ranks among the greatest adventures in Greek mythology.\n                    Jason assembled the finest heroes of Greece, including Heracles, Orpheus, Castor and Pollux,\n                    and Atalanta, aboard the ship Argo. Their journey took them through the Clashing Rocks, past\n                    the Sirens, and through countless perils to reach Colchis.\n                \n                \n                    King Aeetes set Jason impossible tasks: yoking fire-breathing bulls, sowing dragon's teeth\n                    that grew into armed warriors, and defeating the guardian dragon. With the help of Medea,\n                    Aeetes' daughter and a powerful sorceress who fell in love with Jason, the hero completed\n                    these trials and claimed the Fleece."
