  "longDescription": "The olive tree holds supreme sacred status in Greek mythology as Athena's gift to humanity and Athens specifically. In the contest between Athena and Poseidon for patronage of Athens, Poseidon struck the Acropolis with his trident creating a salt-water spring, while Athena caused the first olive tree to sprout from the rock. The Athenians judged Athena's gift superior, as the olive provided food (olives and oil), light (lamp fuel), economic prosperity (trade), wood, and medicinal benefits. The tree represents civilization, wisdom's triumph over brute force, peace, and divine blessing. Olive oil anointed athletes, fueled sacred lamps, and served as offerings. Olive wreaths crowned Olympic victors, and branches symbolized peace and supplication.",

The tree's longevity mirrors enduring values and traditions. Olive branches extended in supplication or peace demonstrate that wisdom recognizes when to fight and when to reconcile.",

The tree's regeneration after Persian destruction in 480 BCE became a powerful symbol of Athenian resilience. The olive branch remains the universal peace symbol (UN flag, national emblems) and 'extending an olive branch' entered common language. Olive oil maintained religious significance in later Jewish and Christian traditions (anointing kings, lamp oil in temples)."
