  "longDescription": "The Sword of Nuada, known in Irish as Claoimh Solais ('Sword of Light'), stands as one of the Four Treasures of the Tuatha De Danann, the divine race that ruled Ireland in mythological times. This legendary blade was brought from the mystical northern city of Findias when the Tuatha De Danann descended upon Ireland in a mist of clouds. Forged or enchanted by the druid Uscias, the sword possessed the terrifying property that once drawn from its sheath, no enemy could escape its reach and none could resist its deadly stroke. The sword blazed with pure, divine light, symbolizing the legitimate violence of the king in defense of his people and the concept of justice made manifest through righteous warfare.",

It was brought from the mythical northern city of Findias, where it was created or enchanted by the druid Uscias, one of the four great druids of the four cities. The sword's most terrifying property was its absolute inescapability: once the sword was drawn from its sheath, no enemy could flee from it, and no one could resist its deadly stroke. As a blade of pure light, it represented justice and righteous warfare - the legitimate violence of the king in defense of his people."

His epithet 'Airgetlam' means 'Silver Hand' - during the First Battle of Mag Tuired against the Fir Bolg, Nuada lost his hand and had to relinquish kingship, as Celtic law required a king to be physically perfect (the concept of fir flathemon, the truth of the ruler). The physician-god Dian Cecht fashioned him a silver hand of full functionality, but Nuada was not restored to kingship until Miach (Dian Cecht's son) replaced the silver hand with one of flesh and blood."

The sword has parallels in other Celtic and Indo-European traditions, including the legendary Excalibur of Arthurian myth, which also conferred sovereignty and legitimate rule upon its wielder."
