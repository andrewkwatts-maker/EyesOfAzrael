  "longDescription": "The Tablets of the Law (Hebrew: לוחות הברית Luchot HaBrit - Tablets of the Covenant) are the two stone tablets upon which God inscribed the Ten Commandments (Aseret HaDibrot) with His own finger. Given to Moses on Mount Sinai after forty days and nights, these tablets represent the covenant between God and Israel. The first set was shattered by Moses when he witnessed the Israelites worshiping the golden calf. God then commanded Moses to hew two new tablets, upon which the commandments were re-inscribed. According to tradition, both the broken fragments and the intact second tablets were kept in the Ark of the Covenant.",

The preservation of both broken and whole tablets in the Ark teaches that even broken spiritual vessels retain holiness and should be honored.",
      "culturalSignificance": "The Tablets are the supreme symbol of Jewish law and ethics. They appear atop Torah scrolls in synagogues worldwide, are depicted in Jewish art and architecture, and represent Judaism in interfaith contexts. The tradition of keeping both broken and whole tablets has inspired countless teachings about honoring those who are 'broken' or fallen, and about the possibility of renewal. The Ten Commandments themselves form the ethical foundation not only of Judaism but of Western civilization."
