He then commissioned the construction of Sainte-Chapelle, completed in 1248,\n                    which cost more than the relic itself.

  "significance": "Significance In Christian theology, the Crown of Thorns carries profound symbolic meaning beyond its historical reality. The thorns connect to the Genesis narrative, where thorns and thistles were part of the curse placed upon the ground after Adam's sin. Christ's wearing of thorns represents his taking upon himself the consequences of human sin and the curse of the Fall. The crown also inverts earthly kingship. While Roman emperors wore laurel wreaths and earthly kings wore golden crowns, Christ accepted a crown of pain. This paradox lies at the heart of Christian understanding: true kingship comes through service and suffering, not through power and domination. The mocking soldiers unwittingly proclaimed a profound truth through their cruelty. Historical Journey According to tradition, the Crown of Thorns remained in Jerusalem until the fourth century, when Saint Helena, mother of Emperor Constantine, discovered it along with the True Cross and other Passion relics. The crown was subsequently transferred to Constantinople, the new capital of the Christian Roman Empire. In 1238, Baldwin II, the Latin Emperor of Constantinople, facing severe financial difficulties, offered the Crown of Thorns to King Louis IX of France. Louis paid an enormous sum for the relic and constructed the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris specifically to house it. The stunning Gothic chapel, with its walls of stained glass, became one of the architectural marvels of medieval Europe.",
