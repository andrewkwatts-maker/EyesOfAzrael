The dragon poisoned the countryside and demanded daily sacrifices\n                    of sheep to appease its hunger.\n                \n                \n                    When sheep grew scarce, the city began sacrificing humans, selected by lot.\n                    One day the lot fell upon the king's daughter. Despite the king's pleas,\n                    the princess was led to the dragon's lake to await her fate.\n                \n\n                Saint George's Intervention\n                \n                    George, a Roman soldier from Cappadocia and a Christian knight, happened upon\n                    the princess awaiting the dragon. Learning of her plight, he resolved to\n                    confront the monster. When the dragon emerged, George charged on horseback,\n                    making the sign of the cross and commending himself to God.\n                \n                \n                    With Ascalon, George struck the dragon a grievous blow, wounding it severely.\n                    He then had the princess tie her girdle around the dragon's neck, and the\n                    beast followed them meekly into the city. There, George promised to slay\n                    the dragon if the people would convert to Christianity. When they agreed,\n                    he killed the beast with his sword, and the king built a church on the spot.",
