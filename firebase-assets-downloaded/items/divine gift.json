The young god accidentally broke off one of Amalthea's horns while playing.\n\nIn gratitude for her care, Zeus blessed the broken horn with the power of inexhaustible plenty, so that it would always overflow with whatever food or drink its possessor desired. When Amalthea died, Zeus honored her further by placing her among the stars as Capella, and he used her hide to make his aegis shield.\n\nThe River God Achelous\n\nAn alternative myth involves Heracles' battle with the river god Achelous for the hand of Deianira. During their wrestling match, Achelous transformed into a bull, but Heracles seized one of his horns and tore it off. The river god exchanged this horn for the original Cornucopia (or in some versions, nymphs filled the broken horn with flowers and fruits, creating the Cornucopia).\n\n'The Naiads took it up and filled it with fruits and fragrant flowers, and hallowed it, and now the good Abundantia is enriched with my horn.' - Ovid, Metamorphoses",

    "longDescription": "The Cornucopia, known in Latin as the 'horn of plenty' (cornu copiae), stands as one of Western civilization's most enduring symbols of abundance, prosperity, and divine generosity. According to Greek mythology, this magical artifact originated when the infant Zeus, hidden from his father Cronus on the island of Crete, accidentally broke off a horn from his nurse Amalthea - either a divine goat or a nymph who tended goats. In gratitude for her care, Zeus blessed the broken horn with the miraculous power to produce unlimited food, drink, and wealth, ensuring its possessor would never know want. An alternative tradition connects the Cornucopia to Heracles' wrestling match with the river god Achelous, during which the hero tore off the god's horn in its bull form. The Romans adopted the Cornucopia as a primary attribute of Fortuna (goddess of luck), Abundantia (personification of plenty), and Ceres (goddess of harvest). Today, the image of the overflowing horn remains instantly recognizable, appearing on state seals, corporate logos, and most prominently as the centerpiece of American Thanksgiving celebrations, where it symbolizes gratitude for nature's bounty and the blessings of harvest.",
