As food, it symbolizes perfect nourishment that requires no supplementation or elimination, reflecting divine perfection. Its fragrance suggests purity and transcendence. The anointing use parallels sacred oils in human rituals, but with actual transformative power—showing how divine versions of mortal practices achieve what mortals can only symbolize. Ambrosia's ability to preserve bodies from decay represents victory over time, corruption, and death—core aspects of immortality. Its occasional availability to mortals suggests that the divine-mortal boundary is permeable for the worthy.",

  "longDescription": "Ambrosia (Greek: ἀμβροσία) is the sacred food of the Olympian gods, typically paired with nectar (divine drink). The word literally means 'immortal' or 'not-mortal' (a- not, mbrotos- mortal), emphasizing its life-sustaining nature. Ambrosia possesses remarkable properties: it sustains the gods' immortality, heals wounds instantly, preserves bodies from decay, and can transform mortals into divine beings. The substance appears in various forms across myths—sometimes fragrant ointment, sometimes solid food. It was used to anoint heroes like Achilles for invulnerability, preserve bodies of the dead, and occasionally grant immortality to favored mortals. The gods consumed ambrosia at Mount Olympus feasts, and its presence defined the boundary between mortal and immortal existence. Some myths describe ambrosia being brought to Olympus by doves.",
