  "longDescription": "Ambrosia (Greek: ἀμβροσία) is the sacred food of the Olympian gods, typically paired with nectar (divine drink). The word literally means 'immortal' or 'not-mortal' (a- not, mbrotos- mortal), emphasizing its life-sustaining nature. Ambrosia possesses remarkable properties: it sustains the gods' immortality, heals wounds instantly, preserves bodies from decay, and can transform mortals into divine beings. The substance appears in various forms across myths—sometimes fragrant ointment, sometimes solid food. It was used to anoint heroes like Achilles for invulnerability, preserve bodies of the dead, and occasionally grant immortality to favored mortals. The gods consumed ambrosia at Mount Olympus feasts, and its presence defined the boundary between mortal and immortal existence. Some myths describe ambrosia being brought to Olympus by doves.",

      "symbolism": "Ambrosia represents the essence of divinity itself—the substance that separates immortals from mortals. As food, it symbolizes perfect nourishment that requires no supplementation or elimination, reflecting divine perfection. Its fragrance suggests purity and transcendence. The anointing use parallels sacred oils in human rituals, but with actual transformative power—showing how divine versions of mortal practices achieve what mortals can only symbolize. Ambrosia's ability to preserve bodies from decay represents victory over time, corruption, and death—core aspects of immortality. Its occasional availability to mortals suggests that the divine-mortal boundary is permeable for the worthy.",
      "culturalSignificance": "Ambrosia entered common language meaning anything supremely delicious or delightful. 'Ambrosia salad' (fruit dessert) and various foods claimed the name to suggest perfection. The concept influenced later religious traditions of sacred foods and substances that connect humans to divinity (manna, communion wafers, soma, etc.). Scientific nomenclature uses 'ambrosia' for ragweed genus and 'ambrosia beetles.' The word embodies humanity's yearning for perfect sustenance that transcends ordinary nutrition—food as spiritual transformation. Modern fantasy literature frequently features ambrosia-like substances granting immortality or divine powers."
