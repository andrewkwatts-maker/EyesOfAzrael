  "longDescription": "The Caduceus (Greek: κηρύκειον kerykeion) is the winged staff carried by Hermes, messenger of the gods and divine herald. The staff features two serpents entwined around a central rod, often topped with wings. According to myth, Hermes received the staff from Apollo in exchange for the lyre. When Hermes encountered two fighting serpents, he placed his staff between them and they coiled around it peacefully, transforming the staff into a symbol of negotiation and peaceful resolution. As Hermes's primary attribute, the caduceus grants safe passage, facilitates communication between realms (mortal and divine, living and dead), and represents commercial exchange and diplomatic immunity. It should not be confused with the Rod of Asclepius (single serpent, no wings), which represents medicine.",

The two serpents, once fighting, now entwined, symbolize balanced opposites, duality in harmony, and the integration of opposing forces. The wings represent swift communication and transcendence of boundaries. As Hermes crosses between realms (Olympus, earth, underworld), the caduceus symbolizes liminality, transition, and the mediator archetype. The serpents also connect to wisdom, renewal (shedding skin), and the chthonic powers Hermes commands.",
