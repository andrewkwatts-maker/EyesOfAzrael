  "longDescription": "The Oak tree (Quercus species) held supreme sacred status across Indo-European cultures, particularly among the Celts where it was the most holy tree of the Druids. Associated with thunder gods, sky deities, and divine wisdom, the oak represented the axis mundi connecting heaven and earth. Its strength, longevity, and tendency to be struck by lightning made it a focal point for sacred groves and ritual practice.",
