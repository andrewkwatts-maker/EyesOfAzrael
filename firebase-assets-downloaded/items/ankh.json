  "longDescription": "The Ankh (☥), also known as the 'key of life' or 'cross of life,' is the most recognizable symbol of ancient Egypt. Resembling a cross with a loop at the top, it represents eternal life, the union of male and female principles, and the breath of life itself. Egyptian gods and goddesses are frequently depicted holding the ankh, offering it to pharaohs to grant them immortality and divine favor. The symbol combines the circle (representing eternal life) with the cross (representing material existence), embodying the Egyptian belief in life after death. The ankh was used in temple rituals, funerary practices, and as a protective amulet worn by both living and dead.",
