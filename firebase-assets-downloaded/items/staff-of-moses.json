Through this simple shepherd's staff, Moses channeled divine power\n                    to bring plagues upon Egypt, part the Red Sea, and bring water from rock.\n                \n                \n                    The staff transforms from an ordinary implement of a shepherd's life into the \"Staff of God\"\n                    (Matteh ha-Elohim), demonstrating that divine power can work through humble means.

According to Midrashic sources,\n                    the staff was created at twilight on the sixth day of Creation, one of ten miraculous objects\n                    made before the first Sabbath. It passed through generations of patriarchs: from Adam to\n                    Enoch to Noah to Shem to Abraham to Isaac to Jacob to Joseph.\n                \n                \n                    After Joseph's death, the staff came into Pharaoh's possession, then to Jethro (Reuel),\n                    who planted it in his garden where it remained fixed until Moses arrived. When Moses\n                    successfully pulled the staff from the ground, Jethro recognized him as the one destined\n                    to deliver Israel.\n                \n\n                \n                    \"And you shall take in your hand this staff, with which you shall do the signs.\"\n                    — Exodus 4:17\n                \n\n                The Name of God\n                \n                    Some traditions hold that the Ineffable Name of God (YHWH) was inscribed upon the staff,\n                    being the source of its miraculous power. This connection between the divine Name and\n                    supernatural ability appears throughout Jewish mystical literature.\n                \n\n                Islamic Tradition\n                \n                    In Islamic tradition, the staff (Asa Musa) features prominently in the Quran's account\n                    of Moses (Musa). The staff transforms into a serpent that devours the staffs of Pharaoh's\n                    magicians, demonstrating the superiority of God's power over Egyptian magic."
