  "longDescription": "Tulsi (Sanskrit: तुलसी, Ocimum tenuiflorum), also known as Holy Basil, is one of the most sacred plants in Hinduism. Revered as a manifestation of the goddess Lakshmi and deeply connected to Lord Vishnu, Tulsi is worshiped in Hindu households and temples across India. According to legend, Tulsi was originally the devoted wife Vrinda who was transformed into the plant. The Tulsi plant is considered so sacred that it is often planted in courtyards and special raised structures (Tulsi Vrindavan). Her leaves are essential in worship rituals dedicated to Vishnu and Krishna. Tulsi is believed to purify the surroundings, ward off evil spirits, and bring divine blessings. In Ayurveda, Tulsi is highly valued for its medicinal properties and is called 'The Queen of Herbs.'",
