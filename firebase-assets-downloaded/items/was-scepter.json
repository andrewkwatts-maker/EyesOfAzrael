  "longDescription": "The Was scepter (wꜣs) is one of ancient Egypt's most important symbols of power and dominion. This ceremonial staff features a long shaft with a forked base and an animal head at the top, typically depicting the Set animal or a canine. Carried by gods, goddesses, and pharaohs, the Was scepter represented divine authority, supernatural power, and control over chaos. The forked bottom symbolized the duality of Egypt (Upper and Lower), while the animal head represented strength and dominance. Often paired with the ankh and djed symbols, forming the powerful triad of 'life, stability, and power,' the Was scepter was central to Egyptian iconography of rulership and divine favor.",

When combined with the ankh (life) and djed (stability), it forms the complete expression of Egyptian divine kingship: eternal life, enduring stability, and absolute power.",
      "culturalSignificance": "The Was scepter became synonymous with Egyptian concepts of legitimate authority. It showed that power came from the gods and could only be wielded by those who maintained Ma'at (cosmic order). The scepter's association with Set, despite his ambiguous nature, demonstrated that even chaotic power must serve divine order. The symbol influenced later concepts of royal regalia throughout the ancient Near East and Mediterranean."
