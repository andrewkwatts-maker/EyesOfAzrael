  "longDescription": "The Bilva (Sanskrit: बिल्व, Aegle marmelos), also known as Bael or Wood Apple tree, is one of the most sacred trees in Hinduism, particularly revered in Shaivism. The tree's distinctive three-leafed (trifoliate) structure makes it especially sacred to Lord Shiva, representing the three aspects of time (past, present, future), the three gunas (sattva, rajas, tamas), and Shiva's trident (Trishula). According to mythology, the Bilva tree arose from the sweat drops of goddess Parvati and is considered extremely dear to Shiva. The leaves are an essential offering in Shiva worship, and it is said that offering Bilva leaves to Shiva absolves sins and brings moksha. The tree and its leaves are believed to be an abode of Lakshmi and have powerful medicinal properties in Ayurveda.",
  "mythologyContexts": [
    {
      "symbolism": "The three leaves of the Bilva represent the trinity (Brahma-Vishnu-Shiva), the three eyes of Shiva, the three times (past-present-future), and the three gunas. The trifoliate structure mirrors Shiva's trident (Trishula), making it a natural symbol of Shiva's power. The leaf's ability to remain fresh for a long time symbolizes the eternal nature of Shiva. Offering Bilva to Shiva represents offering one's three sources of debt (to gods, sages, and ancestors) and the three types of suffering (physical, mental, spiritual). The bitter-sweet taste of Bilva fruit represents the duality of existence that Shiva transcends.",

In Ayurveda, Bilva fruit is highly valued for treating digestive disorders, and the leaves, roots, and bark all have medicinal applications. The tree thus represents the integration of spiritual devotion and physical well-being.",
      "usage": "Bilva leaves are the most sacred offering to Lord Shiva. The three-leafed structure represents Shiva's trident and his three eyes. During Shiva worship, devotees offer fresh Bilva leaves on the Shiva Linga, often in sets of three or multiples thereof. The leaves should ideally be offered with the stalk pointing toward the devotee and the tip toward the deity. Bilva is especially important during Maha Shivaratri and Monday fasts dedicated to Shiva.",
