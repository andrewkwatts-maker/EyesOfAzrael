  "longDescription": "The Aegis (Greek: αἰγίς) is the legendary shield or breastplate of Zeus, often depicted bearing the head of the Gorgon Medusa. While primarily associated with Zeus as a symbol of his supreme authority, the Aegis was frequently lent to his daughter Athena, who wore it as part of her armor. The shield possessed the power to create storms, inspire paralyzing fear in enemies, and provide divine protection. According to myth, the Aegis was made from the hide of the divine goat Amalthea who nursed Zeus as an infant, and was later adorned with Medusa's severed head after Perseus's victory. When shaken, the Aegis produced thunder and lightning, symbolizing Zeus's command over the sky.",

After her death, Zeus preserved her\n                    hide, which possessed supernatural protective properties. This same goat's horn became\n                    the Cornucopia, the horn of plenty.\n                \n\n                The Addition of Medusa's Head\n                \n                    After Perseus slew the Gorgon Medusa with Athena's aid, he presented the severed head to\n                    the goddess. Athena mounted the Gorgoneion upon her aegis, adding its petrifying power to\n                    the shield's already formidable properties. This combination made Athena's aegis the most\n                    terrifying battle accessory in the Greek pantheon.\n                \n\n                \n                    \"About her shoulders she flung the tasselled aegis, fraught with terror... and therein\n                    is set the head of the dread monster, the Gorgon, dread and awful, a portent of Zeus.\"\n                    — Homer, Iliad V\n                \n\n                Homeric Descriptions\n                \n                    In the Iliad, Zeus lends the aegis to Apollo, who uses it to rout the Greeks and protect\n                    the Trojan walls. When Apollo shakes the aegis, the Achaean ranks collapse in terror.\n                    This demonstrates that while Zeus is its primary owner, he could grant its use to other\n                    gods for specific purposes."
