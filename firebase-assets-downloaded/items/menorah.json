  "longDescription": "The Menorah (Hebrew: מְנוֹרָה, literally 'lamp') is the seven-branched golden candelabrum that stood in the Tabernacle and later in the Temple, providing eternal light before the Holy of Holies. Designed according to God's precise specifications given to Moses on Mount Sinai, the Menorah was fashioned from a single piece of pure gold weighing one talent (approximately 34 kg). Its seven lamps burned pure olive oil and represented the seven days of Creation, divine wisdom, and God's eternal presence with Israel. After the Temple's destruction in 70 CE, the Menorah became the preeminent symbol of Judaism and appears as the emblem of the modern State of Israel.",
