  "longDescription": "Soma (Sanskrit: सोम) is the divine nectar described extensively in the Rigveda, both as a sacred ritual drink and as a deity. This mysterious substance was central to Vedic religious practice, extracted from a plant (whose exact identity is debated) through an elaborate ritual process. When consumed, Soma was believed to grant immortality, divine vision, poetic inspiration, physical strength, and spiritual enlightenment. The gods themselves were said to drink Soma to maintain their immortality and power. Indra, in particular, drank vast quantities before his battles with demons. The Moon is also called Soma and is believed to be the cup that contains the divine nectar. The Soma sacrifice was one of the most important Vedic rituals, involving pressing the plant, filtering the juice, mixing it with milk or water, and offering it to the gods while priests and participants also consumed it.",

Soma's golden color connects it to the sun, light, and illumination of consciousness.",

This mystery has fascinated scholars for centuries. Some identify it with psychoactive plants like Ephedra or Amanita muscaria, while others suggest it was a mixture. The concept of Soma influenced later Hindu ideas about amrita (nectar of immortality) obtained during the churning of the cosmic ocean. In Ayurveda, Soma represents the essence of rejuvenation and immortality."
