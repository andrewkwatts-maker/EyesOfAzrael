  "longDescription": "Soma (Sanskrit: सोम) is the divine nectar described extensively in the Rigveda, both as a sacred ritual drink and as a deity. This mysterious substance was central to Vedic religious practice, extracted from a plant (whose exact identity is debated) through an elaborate ritual process. When consumed, Soma was believed to grant immortality, divine vision, poetic inspiration, physical strength, and spiritual enlightenment. The gods themselves were said to drink Soma to maintain their immortality and power. Indra, in particular, drank vast quantities before his battles with demons. The Moon is also called Soma and is believed to be the cup that contains the divine nectar. The Soma sacrifice was one of the most important Vedic rituals, involving pressing the plant, filtering the juice, mixing it with milk or water, and offering it to the gods while priests and participants also consumed it.",

As a physical substance it nourishes the body, as a ritual offering it pleases the gods, and as a mystical experience it grants spiritual insight. The pressing of Soma symbolizes the transformation of matter into spirit, the mundane into the sacred. The Moon as Soma represents the waxing and waning of divine grace and the cyclic nature of spiritual nourishment. Soma's golden color connects it to the sun, light, and illumination of consciousness.",
      "usage": "Soma was the centerpiece of major Vedic sacrifices (Soma Yajna). The ritual involved purchasing the Soma plant, pressing it with stones to extract juice, filtering it through wool, and mixing it with milk or water. Offerings were made to gods, especially Indra, Agni, and the Asvins, while priests and patrons consumed the remainder. The entire 9th Mandala of the Rigveda (114 hymns) is dedicated to Soma. The drink was believed to grant participants communion with the divine, poetic inspiration, and spiritual insight.",
