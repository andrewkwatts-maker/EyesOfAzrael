  "longDescription": "The thurible, also called a censer, is a ritual vessel designed to hold burning incense during religious ceremonies. The Christian thurible typically consists of a metal bowl suspended from chains, with a perforated cover that allows aromatic smoke to escape while containing the burning materials. This design enables the thurifer (person swinging the censer) to direct smoke throughout a sacred space through rhythmic swinging motions.",
