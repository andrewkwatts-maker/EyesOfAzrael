This blade was owned by King Hogni\n                    (also spelled Hogni or Hagen) and played a central role in the legendary\n                    conflict known as the Hjadhningavig or \"Battle of the Heodenings.\"\n                \n                \n                    The sword bears a devastating curse: once drawn from its sheath, Dainsleif\n                    cannot be returned until it has taken a life. This compulsion transforms\n                    every drawing of the sword into an act of inevitable bloodshed. Additionally,\n                    any wound inflicted by Dainsleif can never heal - the victim will eventually\n                    die from even the smallest cut.\n                \n                \n                    As a work of dwarven craft, Dainsleif exemplifies the Norse tradition of\n                    dwarf-forged weapons that carry both immense power and terrible consequences.\n                    The dwarves were renowned for creating the gods' most powerful artifacts,\n                    but their creations often came with hidden costs or curses.",

In some versions, this was arranged by Hildr herself\n                    or was the result of magical compulsion. Regardless of the cause, Hogni\n                    pursued Hedinn across the seas to recover his daughter.\n                \n                \n                    When the two kings finally met on the island of Haey (identified with the\n                    Orkney Islands or another northern location), Hildr attempted to negotiate\n                    peace between them.
