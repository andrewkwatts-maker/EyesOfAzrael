      "content": "The Testament of Solomon\n                \n                    The \"Testament of Solomon,\" a Greek text from the early centuries CE, provides the most\n                    detailed account of the ring's use. It describes how Solomon used the ring to summon and\n                    interrogate demons one by one, learning their names, powers, and weaknesses. Each demon\n                    was then bound to a specific task in building the Temple or confined so it could harm\n                    no one.\n                \n\n                Islamic Tradition\n                \n                    In Islamic tradition, Sulaiman (Solomon) was granted dominion over the jinn by Allah.\n                    The ring allowed him to control winds, understand the speech of animals, and command\n                    armies of spirits. The Quran describes how jinn worked for Solomon, building palaces\n                    and diving for pearls. When he lost the ring briefly to a demon, his kingdom was thrown\n                    into chaos until he recovered it.\n                \n\n                Western Occultism\n                \n                    Medieval grimoires such as the \"Lesser Key of Solomon\" claim to preserve Solomon's magical\n                    knowledge. The hexagram or pentagram became known as the \"Seal of Solomon\" and was used\n                    in ceremonial magic to invoke and constrain spirits. This tradition continues in modern\n                    occultism and has profoundly influenced Western esotericism."
