  "longDescription": "Rice (kome, 米) is the most sacred grain in Japanese culture and Shinto religion, considered a direct gift from the sun goddess Amaterasu. According to mythology, when Amaterasu sent her grandson Ninigi to rule the earthly realm, she gave him rice seeds from the sacred fields of Takamagahara, commanding that rice cultivation would bring prosperity to the land and people. The Nihon Shoki also recounts how the food goddess Ukemochi produced rice from her body, making it a divine substance infused with kami essence. Rice is not merely food but a sacred link between heaven and earth, embodying the kami's blessing and care. Every grain is treated with reverence. Rice is offered daily at Shinto shrines, used in purification ceremonies, and central to seasonal festivals marking planting and harvest. The Emperor himself ritually plants and harvests rice at the Imperial Palace. Rice cultivation shaped Japanese civilization, social structure, and spiritual practices. The Japanese words for rice and meal are the same (gohan), reflecting rice's centrality to life itself.",
