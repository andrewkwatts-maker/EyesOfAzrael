      },
      "magi": {

    "comparativeConclusion": {
      "similarities": "Both traditions use fire to symbolize divine presence, purification, truth, and judgment. Both maintain sacred flames in worship contexts. Both see light/fire as combating darkness/evil.",
      "differences": "Christianity does not worship fire or maintain it as a direct divine manifestation. Fire is instrumental, pointing to God rather than being divine. The incarnation provides a more complete revelation than any natural phenomenon.",
      "respectfulEngagement": "Christians can appreciate Zoroastrian sacred fire theology as a tradition that, like the Hebrew Scriptures, recognized fire's spiritual significance. This provides common ground for interreligious dialogue while maintaining theological distinctives."
