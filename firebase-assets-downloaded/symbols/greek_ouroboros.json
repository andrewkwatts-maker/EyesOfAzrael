  "description": "The Ouroboros is an ancient symbol depicting a serpent or dragon eating its own tail, representing the eternal cycle of destruction and recreation, the infinite nature of existence, and the unity of all things. One of humanity's oldest mystical symbols, it appears across multiple cultures and has profoundly influenced Western esoteric traditions, alchemy, and modern psychology.",
  "longDescription": "The Ouroboros (from the Greek οὐροβόρος, meaning 'tail-devouring') stands as one of the most enduring and universal symbols in human spiritual history. This image of a serpent consuming its own tail encapsulates profound mysteries: the cyclical nature of the universe, the eternal return, the unity of opposites, and the process by which life perpetually renews itself through apparent destruction. The symbol transcends cultural boundaries, appearing independently in Egyptian, Greek, Norse, Hindu, and Mesoamerican traditions, suggesting it touches upon fundamental truths about existence that humanity has intuited across time and space.",
