  "meaning": "The Wheel of Dharma (Dharmachakra) represents the Buddha's teachings and the path to enlightenment. Its eight spokes symbolize the Noble Eightfold Path, the core ethical and mental guidelines for ending suffering.",
  "description": "The Wheel of the Law, Symbol of Buddha's Teaching\n\nThe Dharmachakra (Sanskrit: dharma-cakra, 'Wheel of Dharma') is one of the oldest and most important symbols in Buddhism. It represents the Buddha's first teaching at Deer Park in Sarnath, when he 'set the wheel of Dharma in motion' (Dharmacakrapravartana). The wheel symbolizes the cyclical nature of existence, the path to liberation, and the eternal truth of the Buddha's teachings that continue to turn through all ages.\n\nThe Dharma Wheel is one of the Ashtamangala (Eight Auspicious Symbols) of Buddhism and appears throughout Buddhist art, architecture, and iconography across all traditions.",
  "visualDescription": "The Dharmachakra is depicted as a wheel with eight spokes radiating from a central hub to an outer rim. Traditional representations feature:\n\n**The Hub (Center):** Represents moral discipline (shila), the foundation of practice. In some interpretations, it contains three swirling shapes representing the Three Jewels (Buddha, Dharma, Sangha) or the overcoming of the Three Poisons (ignorance, attachment, aversion).\n\n**The Eight Spokes:** Straight lines radiating outward, each representing one aspect of the Noble Eightfold Path: Right View, Right Intention, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Concentration.\n\n**The Rim:** The outer circle represents meditative concentration (samadhi) that holds the practice together. It also symbolizes the perfection and completeness of the teachings.\n\n**Color Symbolism:** Often depicted in gold or saffron, representing the precious nature of the Dharma. In Tibetan Buddhism, the wheel may be ornamented with silk ribbons and jewels.\n\n**Supporting Elements:** The wheel is frequently shown flanked by two deer, commemorating the Buddha's first sermon at Deer Park (Mrigadava) in Sarnath. This image adorns the rooftops of Tibetan monasteries.",
