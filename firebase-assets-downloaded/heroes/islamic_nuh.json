  "displayName": "Nuh (Noah) - The Patient Prophet",
  "description": "Nuh (Noah) stands as one of the five greatest prophets (Ulul Azm) in Islamic tradition, revered as the 'Second Father of Mankind' who preserved humanity and all living creatures through the Great Flood. His story, detailed extensively in the Quran across multiple surahs, exemplifies extraordinary patience (sabr), unwavering faith (iman), and steadfast obedience to Allah despite nine and a half centuries of rejection by his people. Nuh's mission to call his community to monotheism and his construction of the Ark by divine command represent the archetypal struggle between faith and disbelief, marking a pivotal moment in Islamic sacred history.",
  "origins": {
    "propheticLineage": "Nuh is the tenth generation descendant of Adam, son of Lamech (Lamak). He was born during an era when humanity had fallen into widespread polytheism and moral corruption, having forgotten the pure monotheism of their forefather Adam.",
    "divineSelection": "Allah chose Nuh as His messenger to guide humanity back to the straight path (Sirat al-Mustaqim). He received revelation (wahy) commanding him to warn his people of divine punishment if they did not abandon idol worship.",
    "historicalContext": "According to Islamic tradition, Nuh lived for 950 years, spending most of this time calling his people to worship Allah alone. His story is one of the most frequently referenced prophetic narratives in the Quran."

    "theArk": "By divine command, Nuh constructed the Ark (al-Safinah) on dry land, far from any body of water. Angels assisted in its construction while his people mocked him. The Ark was designed to carry pairs of every animal species and the believing remnant of humanity.",
    "theFlood": "When the command came, water erupted from the earth and poured from the sky. Nuh called his family to board, but his son Kan'an (or Yam) refused, believing he could survive on a mountain. The flood destroyed all disbelievers while the Ark carried the faithful to safety.",
    "newCovenant": "After the flood subsided and the Ark came to rest on Mount Judi (in some traditions, the ark landed where the ark rest near modern-day Turkey), Nuh and the survivors established a new human civilization.
