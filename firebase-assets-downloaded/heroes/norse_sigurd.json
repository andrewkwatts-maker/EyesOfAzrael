  "description": "Sigurd (Old Norse: Sigurðr; Middle High German: Siegfried) was the supreme hero of Germanic and Norse legend, the dragon-slayer par excellence. Descended from Odin through the Volsung line, he was raised by the cunning dwarf Regin, who forged for him the sword Gram and set him against the dragon Fafnir—once a dwarf, transformed by greed into a monstrous serpent guarding cursed gold. Sigurd's victory made him seemingly invincible (bathed in dragon blood) yet doomed by the cursed treasure he claimed. His tragic love for the valkyrie Brynhild, forgotten through a magic potion, led to betrayal and death. His story, preserved in the Volsunga Saga and Poetic Edda, became the foundation for the medieval Nibelungenlied and Wagner's Ring Cycle.",

    "overview": "Sigurd/Siegfried presented complex typological material for medieval Christian interpreters. The dragon-slayer dying through betrayal offered parallels to Christ, while the cursed gold warned against worldly attachment.",
    "dragonSlayer": "Sigurd's victory over Fafnir exemplifies the serpent-slaying motif (Genesis 3:15). Medieval readers saw dragon-slayers as types of Christ crushing Satan. The Norse serpent Fafnir, transformed by greed, represents sin's deforming power.",
    "vulnerabilityAndDeath": "Like Achilles (heel) and Christ (chosen mortality), Sigurd has one vulnerable point—where a linden leaf fell during his blood-bath. He is killed through betrayal by those closest to him, as Christ was betrayed by Judas.",
    "cursedTreasure": "The gold of Fafnir carries Andvari's curse—all who possess it are destroyed. This parallels the biblical warning that 'the love of money is the root of all evil' (1 Timothy 6:10). Sigurd, despite his wisdom, cannot escape the curse.",
    "baptismImagery": "Sigurd's bathing in dragon blood for invulnerability inverts Christian baptism—blood conferring earthly power rather than water conferring spiritual life. The one vulnerable spot shows the insufficiency of all earthly protections.",
    "restoredHonor": "In some versions, Sigurd is mourned as one who will return or whose spirit endures. The Volsung dynasty ends with him, but his legend lives forever—an immortality of fame, not resurrection.",

      "medievalReception": "Medieval Christian audiences read dragon-slaying legends through the lens of saints' lives (George, Michael). Sigurd became a model for the Christian knight.",
      "wagnerianInterpretation": "Wagner's Ring Cycle adds explicit redemption theology—the gods' twilight and Brunnhilde's sacrifice parallel Christian apocalypse and atonement.",
