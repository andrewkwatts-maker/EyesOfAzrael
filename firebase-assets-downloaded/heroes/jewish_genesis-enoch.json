  "description": "Enoch is one of the most enigmatic figures in the Hebrew Bible. Only four verses in Genesis (5:21-24) describe him, yet he became one of the most important figures in Jewish apocalyptic literature, early Christianity, and Islamic tradition. Unlike every other figure in Genesis 5's genealogy who 'died,' Enoch's account ends with the mysterious phrase 'he was not, for God took him.' This unique departure from the standard formula sparked centuries of interpretation and elaboration. The brevity of the biblical account contrasts sharply with the extensive traditions that developed around him.",
  "extendedContent": {
    "mythology": {
      "biblicalFoundation": "The biblical Enoch appears in Genesis 5, the genealogy from Adam to Noah. His life of 365 years corresponds to the solar year, perhaps connecting him to astronomical knowledge. The phrase 'walked with God' (hithalech et-ha'elohim) is used only of Enoch and Noah, suggesting exceptional righteousness.",
      "assumptionTradition": "The phrase 'he was not, for God took him' (einenu ki lakach oto Elohim) generated extensive speculation. Unlike all others in Genesis 5 who 'died,' Enoch was 'taken' - suggesting bodily translation to heaven without experiencing death. He shares this distinction with Elijah (2 Kings 2).",
      "positionSignificance": "Enoch's position as the seventh from Adam carries symbolic weight. Seven represents completion and perfection in biblical numerology. His son Methuselah lived 969 years - the longest lifespan recorded - and died the year of the Flood."
    },
    "kabbalah": {
      "metatronTransformation": "Kabbalistic tradition identifies Enoch with Metatron, the highest angel who bears God's name. 3 Enoch describes his transformation: his flesh becoming fire, receiving 72 wings, 365,000 eyes, and a throne at the entrance to the seventh heaven.",
      "sefirotConnection": "Some traditions connect Enoch to Keter (Crown), the highest sefirah, reflecting his unique access to divine presence.",
      "hiddenWisdom": "Enoch represents the transmission of hidden wisdom (chokmah nistarah) from before the Flood to future generations."
    },
    "talmudic": {
      "assumptionDebate": "Rabbinic sources debate Enoch's fate. Some affirm his translation to heaven; others suggest he died like others but God 'took' his soul suddenly. The brevity of his life compared to other antediluvians sparked various explanations.",
      "prophetsComparison": "Jude 14-15 cites Enoch as a prophet, quoting from 1 Enoch's prophecy of judgment. This New Testament reference validates the Enochic prophetic tradition."
