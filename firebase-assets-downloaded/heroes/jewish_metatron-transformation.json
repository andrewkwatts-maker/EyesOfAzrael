  "description": "3 Enoch (Sefer Hekhalot) describes the most dramatic apotheosis in Jewish literature: Enoch's transformation into Metatron, the highest of all angels. This text, dated to the 5th-6th century CE, represents the culmination of the Enochic tradition, depicting how the mortal man who 'walked with God' was elevated to become second only to God in the heavenly hierarchy. Metatron becomes 'the Lesser YHWH' - a title so bold it sparked rabbinic controversy. His body expands to cosmic proportions, his flesh becomes fire, and he receives 72 wings and 365,000 luminous eyes. This transformation represents the ultimate possibility of human divinization in Jewish mystical thought.",
  "extendedContent": {
    "mythology": {
      "transformationProcess": "When God raised Enoch to serve before the Throne of Glory, He transformed every aspect of Enoch's being. His bones became fire, his flesh flame, his eyes torches, his sinews blazing light. The Holy One clothed him in a glorious garment, crowned him with a crown of royalty with 49 stones like the light of the sun, and inscribed upon him the secret letters by which heaven and earth were created.",
      "cosmicEnlargement": "God enlarged Metatron's size until he was equal in size to the length and breadth of the world. He gave him 72 wings - 36 on each side - and 365,000 eyes, each eye like the Great Light. From the light of his crown there shone light that reached into all four quarters of the Araboth and into the seven heavens.",
      "controversy": "When Acher (Elisha ben Abuya) ascended and saw Metatron sitting enthroned, he exclaimed: 'Perhaps there are two powers in heaven!' For this heresy, Metatron was punished with sixty strokes of fire to demonstrate his subordination to God. This episode demonstrates rabbinic caution about attributing divine status to any being other than God."

    "kabbalah": {
      "divineNames": "Metatron's 70 names correspond to 70 nations, 70 languages, and 70 aspects of Torah. His ultimate name shares letters with the Tetragrammaton (YHWH), making him the 'Lesser YHWH.'",
      "sefirahAssociation": "Metatron is associated with Keter (Crown) in some systems, or with Tiferet, the central sefirah bridging above and below.",
      "treeOfLife": "As the highest angel, Metatron represents the channel through which divine light descends from Ein Sof into the created worlds."

      "chagigahPassage": "Chagigah 15a discusses how Acher saw Metatron given permission to sit and record the merits of Israel. This led to his heretical conclusion about 'two powers.'",
