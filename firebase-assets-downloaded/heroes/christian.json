Gospel author, theologian, seer of Revelation. The only apostle not martyred, lived to old age in Ephesus.\r\n            </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"golden-box\">\r\n<h3>John the Apostle, the Beloved Disciple</h3>\r\n<ul class=\"attribute-list\">\r\n<li><strong>Name:</strong> John (Hebrew: Yochanan = \"Yahweh is gracious\")</li>\r\n<li><strong>Family:</strong> Son of Zebedee, brother of James the Greater; mother possibly Salome</li>\r\n<li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Fisherman on the Sea of Galilee</li>\r\n<li><strong>Nickname:</strong> \"Boanerges\" (Son of Thunder) with his brother James</li>\r\n<li><strong>Role:</strong> Member of Christ's inner circle, \"The Beloved Disciple,\" Gospel author</li>\r\n<li><strong>Symbol:</strong> Eagle, chalice with serpent, book</li>\r\n<li><strong>Feast Day:</strong> December 27</li>\r\n<li><strong>Patronage:</strong> Theologians, writers, friendships, love, loyalty</li>\r\n<li><strong>Lived:</strong> c. 6 CE - c. 100 CE (oldest living apostle)</li>\r\n<li><strong>Death:</strong> Natural causes in Ephesus (only apostle not martyred)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h2>Biography</h2>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.8;\">\r\n            John the Apostle stands as the most theologically profound of Jesus' disciples, the author of the Fourth Gospel, three epistles, and the Book of Revelation. Known as \"the disciple whom Jesus loved,\" John enjoyed the most intimate relationship with Christ, leaning on His breast at the Last Supper and standing at the foot of the cross when others had fled. His Gospel emphasizes Jesus as the eternal Logos (Word) who became flesh, focusing on divine love, light, and life. Tradition holds he was the only apostle to die of natural causes, living to extreme old age in Ephesus, where he continued to proclaim one simple message: \"Little children, love one another.\"\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Key Moments in Scripture</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"key-moment\">\r\n<h4>1. Called as \"Son of Thunder\"</h4>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.8;\">\r\n                Jesus gave John and his brother James the nickname \"Boanerges\" (Sons of Thunder), likely reflecting their fiery temperament. This is demonstrated when a Samaritan village refused Jesus entry, and James and John asked, \"Lord, do you want us to tell fire to come down from heaven and consume them?\" Jesus rebuked them, showing the transformation needed in His disciples.\r\n            </p>\r\n<p class=\"verse-ref\">Mark 3:17; Luke 9:51-56</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"key-moment\">\r\n<h4>2. The Transfiguration</h4>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.8;\">\r\n                John, along with Peter and James, witnessed Jesus transfigured in glory on the mountain, conversing with Moses and Elijah. They saw Christ's divine nature revealed and heard the Father's voice: \"This is my beloved Son; listen to him.\" This vision of Christ's glory profoundly influenced John's theological understanding.\r\n            </p>\r\n<p class=\"verse-ref\">Matthew 17:1-9; Mark 9:2-8; Luke 9:28-36</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"key-moment\">\r\n<h4>3. The Request for Honor</h4>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.8;\">\r\n                James and John (or their mother Salome on their behalf) asked Jesus, \"Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.\" Jesus responded, \"You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink?\" They claimed they could, and Jesus prophesied they would indeed drink His cup of suffering.\r\n            </p>\r\n<p class=\"verse-ref\">Matthew 20:20-28; Mark 10:35-45</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"key-moment\">\r\n<h4>4. Leaning on Jesus' Breast at the Last Supper</h4>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.8;\">\r\n                At the Last Supper, John reclined next to Jesus, leaning back against His chest—the position of honor and intimacy. When Peter wanted to know who would betray Jesus, he signaled to John, who asked Jesus directly. This scene epitomizes John's special relationship with Christ as \"the disciple whom Jesus loved.\"\r\n            </p>\r\n<p class=\"verse-ref\">John 13:23-26; John 21:20</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"key-moment\">\r\n<h4>5. At the Foot of the Cross</h4>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.8;\">\r\n                While other disciples fled, John stood at the foot of the cross with Mary, Jesus' mother. Jesus entrusted His mother to John's care: \"Woman, behold, your son... Behold, your mother.\" From that hour, John took Mary into his own home. This demonstrates both his courage and Jesus' complete trust in him.\r\n            </p>\r\n<p class=\"verse-ref\">John 19:25-27</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"key-moment\">\r\n<h4>6. First to Believe in the Resurrection</h4>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.8;\">\r\n                When Mary Magdalene reported the empty tomb, Peter and John ran together. John outran Peter and reached the tomb first but waited. After Peter entered, John went in, \"and he saw and believed.\" John was the first disciple to believe in the resurrection based on the evidence of the empty tomb and grave clothes.\r\n            </p>\r\n<p class=\"verse-ref\">John 20:1-10</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h2>Traditional Symbol and Iconography</h2>\r\n<div class=\"golden-box\">\r\n<ul style=\"line-height: 1.8;\">\r\n<li><strong>Eagle:</strong> The symbol of John the Evangelist, representing the soaring, heavenly nature of his Gospel which begins with the cosmic Logos. The eagle was believed to look directly into the sun without blinking, as John looked directly into divine mysteries</li>\r\n<li><strong>Chalice with Serpent:</strong> According to tradition, John was challenged to drink poisoned wine but emerged unharmed when he blessed the cup, causing the poison to leave in the form of a serpent</li>\r\n<li><strong>Book:</strong> Represents his authorship of the Gospel, three epistles, and Revelation</li>\r\n<li><strong>Quill and Inkpot:</strong> Symbolizing his role as inspired writer of Scripture</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h2>Martyrdom and Death Tradition</h2>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.8;\">\r\n            Unlike his brother James (the first apostolic martyr) and the other apostles, John survived all attempts at martyrdom. According to tradition, during the persecution under Emperor Domitian (c. 81-96 CE), John was arrested and taken to Rome. There he was placed in a cauldron of boiling oil outside the Latin Gate, but miraculously emerged unharmed and even refreshed. This \"martyrdom in will\" (since he was willing to die but God preserved him) is commemorated in the feast of St. John Before the Latin Gate (May 6).\r\n        </p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.8;\">\r\n            Following this, John was exiled to the island of Patmos in the Aegean Sea, where he received the visions recorded in the Book of Revelation. After Domitian's death, John returned to Ephesus, where he continued to oversee the churches of Asia Minor. He wrote his Gospel in his old age and dictated his three epistles.\r\n        </p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.8;\">\r\n            Tradition says John lived to be over 90 years old—some sources claim over 100. In his final years, he was too weak to walk and had to be carried to church gatherings. When asked to speak, he would simply repeat: \"Little children, love one another.\" When his disciples tired of hearing the same message, John replied, \"It is the Lord's command. And if this alone be done, it is enough.\" He died peacefully in Ephesus around 100 CE and was buried there.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Legacy and Veneration</h2>\r\n<div class=\"golden-box\">\r\n<h3>The Theologian</h3>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.8;\">\r\n                John's Gospel stands apart from the Synoptics with its profound theological depth. His opening—\"In the beginning was the Word (Logos), and the Word was with God, and the Word was God\"—established the foundation for Christian theology about Christ's divinity and pre-existence. His emphasis on divine love (\"God is love,\" 1 John 4:8) shaped Christian understanding of God's nature.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Seer</h3>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.8;\">\r\n                The Book of Revelation, written during John's exile on Patmos, provided Christianity with its most detailed vision of the end times, the cosmic battle between good and evil, and the ultimate triumph of Christ. Its vivid imagery has influenced Christian eschatology, art, and literature for two millennia.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Apostle of Love</h3>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.8;\">\r\n                John's transformation from the fiery \"Son of Thunder\" who wanted to call down fire on Samaritans to the aged apostle who could only say \"love one another\" demonstrates the transforming power of Christ's love. His first epistle is a sustained meditation on divine love and its practical implications.\r\n            </p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h2>Biblical References</h2>\r\n<div class=\"golden-box\">\r\n<h3>Key Verses from John's Writings</h3>\r\n<ul style=\"line-height: 1.8;\">\r\n<li><strong>John 1:1:</strong> \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\"</li>\r\n<li><strong>John 1:14:</strong> \"And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.\"</li>\r\n<li><strong>John 3:16:</strong> \"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.\"</li>\r\n<li><strong>John 13:34-35:</strong> \"A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another.\"</li>\r\n<li><strong>1 John 4:8:</strong> \"Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love.\"</li>\r\n<li><strong>1 John 4:16:</strong> \"God is love, and whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.\"</li>\r\n<li><strong>Revelation 1:8:</strong> \"'I am the Alpha and the Omega,' says the Lord God, 'who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.'\"</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h2>See Also</h2>\r\n<div class=\"see-also-links\">\r\n<a href=\"james-son-of-zebedee.html\" class=\"see-also-link\">\r\n<span>⚔️</span> James the Greater - John's brother\r\n    </a>\r\n<a href=\"peter.html\" class=\"see-also-link\">\r\n<span>🗝️</span> Peter - Inner circle companion\r\n    </a>\r\n<a href=\"andrew.html\" class=\"see-also-link\">\r\n<span>✝️</span> Andrew - Fellow disciple\r\n    </a>\r\n<a href=\"index.html\" class=\"see-also-link\">\r\n<span>📖</span> All Twelve Disciples\r\n    </a>\r\n<a href=\"../../deities/jesus-christ.html\" class=\"see-also-link\">\r\n<span>✝️</span> Jesus Christ\r\n    </a>\r\n<a href=\"../../deities/virgin_mary.html\" class=\"see-also-link\">\r\n<span>👸</span> Virgin Mary\r\n    </a>\r\n<a href=\"../../texts/index.html\" class=\"see-also-link\">\r\n<span>📖</span> Gospel of John\r\n    </a>\r\n<a href=\"../index.html\" class=\"see-also-link\">\r\n<span>⚔️</span> All Christian Heroes\r\n    </a>\r\n</div>\r\n</section>\r\n</main>\r\n<footer>\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>John - The Beloved Disciple</strong> - Apostle of Love<br/>\r\n<a href=\"../../../../mythos/index.html\">World Mythos Home</a> |\r\n    <a href=\"../../index.html\">Christian Tradition</a> |\r\n    <a href=\"index.html\">Twelve Disciples</a>\r\n</p>\r\n</footer>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n",

Gospel author, theologian, seer of Revelation. The only apostle not martyred, lived to old age in Ephesus. John the Apostle, the Beloved Disciple Name: John (Hebrew: Yochanan = \"Yahweh is gracious\") Family: Son of Zebedee, brother of James the Greater; mother possibly Salome Occupation: Fisherman on the Sea of Galilee Nickname: \"Boanerges\" (Son of Thunder) with his brother James Role: Member of Christ's inner circle, \"The Beloved Disciple,\" Gospel author Symbol: Eagle, chalice with serpent, book Feast Day: December 27 Patronage: Theologians, writers, friendships, love, loyalty Lived: c. 6 CE - c. 100 CE (oldest living apostle) Death: Natural causes in Ephesus (only apostle not martyred) Biography John the Apostle stands as the most theologically profound of Jesus' disciples, the author of the Fourth Gospel, three epistles, and the Book of Revelation. Known as \"the disciple whom Jesus loved,\" John enjoyed the most intimate relationship with Christ, leaning on His breast at the Last Supper and standing at the foot of the cross when others had fled. His Gospel emphasizes Jesus as the eternal Logos (Word) who became flesh, focusing on divine love, light, and life. Tradition holds he was the only apostle to die of natural causes, living to extreme old age in Ephesus, where he continued to proclaim one simple message: \"Little children, love one another.\" Key Moments in Scripture 1. Called as \"Son of Thunder\" Jesus gave John and his brother James the nickname \"Boanerges\" (Sons of Thunder), likely reflecting their fiery temperament. This is demonstrated when a Samaritan village refused Jesus entry, and James and John asked, \"Lord, do you want us to tell fire to come down from heaven and consume them?\" Jesus rebuked them, showing the transformation needed in His disciples. Mark 3:17; Luke 9:51-56 2. The Transfiguration John, along with Peter and James, witnessed Jesus transfigured in glory on the mountain, conversing with Moses and Elijah. They saw Christ's divine nature revealed and heard the Father's voice: \"This is my beloved Son; listen to him.\" This vision of Christ's glory profoundly influenced John's theological understanding. Matthew 17:1-9; Mark 9:2-8; Luke 9:28-36 3. The Request for Honor James and John (or their mother Salome on their behalf) asked Jesus, \"Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.\" Jesus responded, \"You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink?\" They claimed they could, and Jesus prophesied they would indeed drink His cup of suffering. Matthew 20:20-28; Mark 10:35-45 4. Leaning on Jesus' Breast at the Last Supper At the Last Supper, John reclined next to Jesus, leaning back against His chest—the position of honor and intimacy. When Peter wanted to know who would betray Jesus, he signaled to John, who asked Jesus directly. This scene epitomizes John's special relationship with Christ as \"the disciple whom Jesus loved.\" John 13:23-26; John 21:20 5. At the Foot of the Cross While other disciples fled, John stood at the foot of the cross with Mary, Jesus' mother. Jesus entrusted His mother to John's care: \"Woman, behold, your son... Behold, your mother.\" From that hour, John took Mary into his own home. This demonstrates both his courage and Jesus' complete trust in him. John 19:25-27 6. First to Believe in the Resurrection When Mary Magdalene reported the empty tomb, Peter and John ran together. John outran Peter and reached the tomb first but waited. After Peter entered, John went in, \"and he saw and believed.\" John was the first disciple to believe in the resurrection based on the evidence of the empty tomb and grave clothes. John 20:1-10 Traditional Symbol and Iconography Eagle: The symbol of John the Evangelist, representing the soaring, heavenly nature of his Gospel which begins with the cosmic Logos. The eagle was believed to look directly into the sun without blinking, as John looked directly into divine mysteries Chalice with Serpent: According to tradition, John was challenged to drink poisoned wine but emerged unharmed when he blessed the cup, causing the poison to leave in the form of a serpent Book: Represents his authorship of the Gospel, three epistles, and Revelation Quill and Inkpot: Symbolizing his role as inspired writer of Scripture Martyrdom and Death Tradition Unlike his brother James (the first apostolic martyr) and the other apostles, John survived all attempts at martyrdom. According to tradition, during the persecution under Emperor Domitian (c. 81-96 CE), John was arrested and taken to Rome. There he was placed in a cauldron of boiling oil outside the Latin Gate, but miraculously emerged unharmed and even refreshed. This \"martyrdom in will\" (since he was willing to die but God preserved him) is commemorated in the feast of St. John Before the Latin Gate (May 6). Following this, John was exiled to the island of Patmos in the Aegean Sea, where he received the visions recorded in the Book of Revelation. After Domitian's death, John returned to Ephesus, where he continued to oversee the churches of Asia Minor. He wrote his Gospel in his old age and dictated his three epistles. Tradition says John lived to be over 90 years old—some sources claim over 100. In his final years, he was too weak to walk and had to be carried to church gatherings. When asked to speak, he would simply repeat: \"Little children, love one another.\" When his disciples tired of hearing the same message, John replied, \"It is the Lord's command. And if this alone be done, it is enough.\" He died peacefully in Ephesus around 100 CE and was buried there. Legacy and Veneration The Theologian John's Gospel stands apart from the Synoptics with its profound theological depth. His opening—\"In the beginning was the Word (Logos), and the Word was with God, and the Word was God\"—established the foundation for Christian theology about Christ's divinity and pre-existence. His emphasis on divine love (\"God is love,\" 1 John 4:8) shaped Christian understanding of God's nature. The Seer The Book of Revelation, written during John's exile on Patmos, provided Christianity with its most detailed vision of the end times, the cosmic battle between good and evil, and the ultimate triumph of Christ. Its vivid imagery has influenced Christian eschatology, art, and literature for two millennia. The Apostle of Love John's transformation from the fiery \"Son of Thunder\" who wanted to call down fire on Samaritans to the aged apostle who could only say \"love one another\" demonstrates the transforming power of Christ's love. His first epistle is a sustained meditation on divine love and its practical implications. Biblical References Key Verses from John's Writings John 1:1: \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\" John 1:14: \"And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.\" John 3:16: \"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.\" John 13:34-35: \"A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another.\" 1 John 4:8: \"Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love.\" 1 John 4:16: \"God is love, and whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.\" Revelation 1:8: \"'I am the Alpha and the Omega,' says the Lord God, 'who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.'\" See Also ⚔️ James the Greater - John's brother 🗝️ Peter - Inner circle companion ✝️ Andrew - Fellow disciple 📖 All Twelve Disciples ✝️ Jesus Christ 👸 Virgin Mary 📖 Gospel of John ⚔️ All Christian Heroes John - The Beloved Disciple - Apostle of Love World Mythos Home | Christian Tradition | Twelve Disciples",
