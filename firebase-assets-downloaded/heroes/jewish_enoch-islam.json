  "description": "Enoch (Hebrew: Hanokh, Arabic: Idris) is one of only two figures in the Hebrew Bible who was taken to heaven without dying - 'Enoch walked with God; then he was no more, because God took him' (Genesis 5:24). Seventh in line from Adam, Enoch lived 365 years before his assumption. In Islamic tradition, he is identified as the prophet Idris, mentioned in Quran 19:56-57 as 'a man of truth, a prophet' whom Allah 'raised to a high station.' During the Prophet Muhammad's Night Journey (Isra and Mi'raj), he met Idris in the fourth heaven. The Books of Enoch (1 Enoch, 2 Enoch, 3 Enoch) preserved in Ethiopian and Slavonic traditions describe elaborate visions of heaven, the fallen angels (Watchers), and apocalyptic revelations. Enoch's assumption without death made him a prototype for resurrection hope and heavenly transformation in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic thought.",
