  "description": "Abraham (Hebrew: Avraham, 'father of many nations'; originally Abram, 'exalted father') is the founding patriarch of the Jewish people, the first Hebrew, and the paradigm of biblical faith. Born in Ur of the Chaldees (Mesopotamia), he received God's call to leave his homeland (Genesis 12:1-3) and journey to an unknown land based solely on divine promise. This act of faith became the model celebrated in Hebrews 11:8-19. God established an eternal covenant with Abraham through circumcision (Genesis 17), promising that through his descendants 'all the families of the earth shall be blessed' (Genesis 12:3). In Christian theology, Abraham is the model of justification by faith: 'Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness' (Genesis 15:6; Romans 4:3). His near-sacrifice of Isaac (the Akedah) became for the Church Fathers the supreme Old Testament type of God the Father offering His only Son, and of Christ's willing submission to the cross. Paul calls Abraham 'the father of all who believe' (Romans 4:11), making Gentile Christians his spiritual descendants through faith in Christ. Abraham is honored across all three Abrahamic faiths: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.",
  "extendedContent": {
    "mythology": {
      "covenantNarratives": "God called Abram to leave everything familiar for an unknown destination, promising to make him a great nation. This act of faith became Abraham's defining characteristic. The Covenant Between the Parts formalized God's promise that his descendants would inherit the land from Egypt to the Euphrates. At age 99, God changed his name to Abraham ('father of many nations') and established circumcision as the eternal sign of the covenant.",
      "akedah": "The supreme test of Abraham's faith came when God commanded him to offer Isaac as a burnt offering on Mount Moriah. Despite this contradicting God's promises, Abraham obeyed. At the moment he raised the knife, an angel stopped him. The Akedah (Binding) became the paradigm of Jewish faith - complete submission to God even when His commands seem impossible to understand. The site would later become the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.",
      "hospitalityTradition": "Abraham welcomed three visitors (angels in disguise) with lavish hospitality, establishing the Jewish value of hachnasat orchim (welcoming guests). He boldly negotiated with God to spare Sodom if ten righteous people could be found."
