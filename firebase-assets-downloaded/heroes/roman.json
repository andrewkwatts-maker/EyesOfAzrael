    "displayName": "Aeneas - Founder of Roman Destiny",
    "description": "Aeneas stands as the supreme hero of Roman mythology, a Trojan prince whose epic journey from the ashes of Troy to the shores of Italy established the divine destiny of Rome. Son of the mortal Anchises and the goddess Venus (Aphrodite), Aeneas embodies the cardinal Roman virtue of pietas - dutiful devotion to gods, family, and fatherland. His story, immortalized in Virgil's Aeneid, presents him as the legendary ancestor of Romulus and Remus and, by extension, of the Julian dynasty including Julius Caesar and Augustus. Unlike Greek heroes who sought personal glory, Aeneas sacrificed individual desires for the collective destiny of his people, making him the archetypal Roman hero.",
    "origins": {
      "divineParentage": "Aeneas was born of the union between the Trojan prince Anchises and Venus (Greek Aphrodite), who fell in love with the mortal while he tended cattle on Mount Ida. This divine heritage marked Aeneas for greatness and ensured the protection of Venus throughout his trials.",
