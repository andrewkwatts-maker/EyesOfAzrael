  "subtitle": "The Cunning Hero - King of Ithaca",
  "description": "Odysseus (Latin: Ulysses) was the paradigm of Greek heroic intelligence, renowned above all others for his cunning (metis) and endurance. King of the rocky island of Ithaca, he was a reluctant participant in the Trojan War but became essential to Greek victory through stratagems rather than brute force—most famously the Wooden Horse. His ten-year wandering homeward, chronicled in Homer's Odyssey, became the archetypal journey narrative, testing him against monsters, gods, and the temptation to abandon his identity. Where Achilles embodied the heroic ideal of glorious death, Odysseus represents survival, homecoming, and the triumph of wit over force.",
