  "description": "Rama (Sanskrit: lord of virtue) is the seventh avatar of Vishnu and the central hero of the Ramayana, one of Hinduism's two great epics (composed by Valmiki, c. 5th-4th century BCE). As prince and later king of Ayodhya, Rama embodies dharma (righteous duty) in its most perfect form: he is the ideal son who accepts exile to preserve his father's honor, the ideal husband who rescues his wife Sita from the demon king Ravana, the ideal brother who inspires unwavering loyalty from Lakshmana and Bharata, and the ideal king whose rule became synonymous with utopia (Rama-rajya). His fourteen-year exile, alliance with Hanuman and the monkey army, and war against Lanka to rescue Sita constitute the Ramayana's main narrative. Rama is worshipped throughout India and Southeast Asia as the supreme exemplar of virtuous conduct.",

    "overview": "Rama has been the subject of interfaith dialogue since the 19th century. While there is no patristic engagement (the Church Fathers did not know the Ramayana), modern comparative theology has explored meaningful parallels while respecting differences.",
    "incarnation": "Both Rama and Christ are divine beings who take human form—Rama as Vishnu's avatar, Christ as the eternal Word made flesh (John 1:14). Both descend to defeat evil and restore righteousness.",
    "exileAndHumility": "Rama's willing acceptance of exile to honor his father parallels Christ's kenosis—emptying himself of divine prerogatives (Philippians 2:6-8). Both choose suffering over power.",
    "rescueOfTheBeloved": "Rama rescues Sita (often interpreted as the soul held captive by demonic forces). Christian theologians have compared this to Christ rescuing the Church, his bride, from Satan's captivity.",
    "victoryOverEvil": "Rama's defeat of Ravana parallels Christ's defeat of Satan. Both represent cosmic victory of good over evil, restoration of divine order.",
    "righteousKingship": "Rama-rajya, the ideal kingdom, parallels the Kingdom of God. Both represent eschatological hope for perfect rule.",
    "sufferingRighteousness": "Both Rama and Christ suffer despite their righteousness—indeed, because of it. Their suffering has redemptive significance for others.",
    "missionaryEncounter": "19th-century missionaries in India grappled with Rama's popularity. Some dismissed Hindu devotion; others (like Roberto de Nobili earlier) saw praeparatio evangelica in Hindu longing for divine incarnation and rescue from evil.",

      "Rama is an avatar (descent); Christ is the eternal Son who takes on human nature permanently",
      "Rama's mission is to defeat one demon king; Christ's mission is to defeat sin and death universally",

      "Rama establishes an earthly utopia; Christ's kingdom is 'not of this world' (John 18:36)",
