  "description": "Theseus was the great national hero of Athens, whose exploits became the paradigm for Athenian civic virtue. Son of King Aegeus (or, in some traditions, Poseidon) and Aethra of Troezen, he combined the monster-slaying prowess of Heracles with political wisdom. His most famous deed—entering the Labyrinth of Crete to slay the Minotaur—freed Athens from bloody tribute. Unlike the wild Heracles, Theseus was celebrated as a civilizer: he unified Attica, established democratic institutions, and gave refuge to the persecuted. He represents the transition from mythic hero to political founder.",
