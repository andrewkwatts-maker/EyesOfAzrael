  "description": "Achilles (Greek: Achilleus) stands as the greatest warrior of Greek mythology and the central figure of Homer's Iliad, embodying both the glory and tragedy of the heroic ideal. Born to the sea-nymph Thetis and the mortal king Peleus, Achilles was destined from birth for a fateful choice: a long, obscure life or a short life of eternal glory. His mother, knowing his fate, attempted to make him immortal by dipping him in the River Styx, holding him by his heel - which remained vulnerable. Raised by the centaur Chiron on Mount Pelion, Achilles learned the arts of war, medicine, and music, emerging as the most formidable warrior of his generation. When the Greeks sailed for Troy to reclaim Helen, Achilles initially hid on Skyros disguised as a girl (according to later traditions), but Odysseus discovered him, and he joined the expedition knowing he would never return home. For nine years Achilles was the Greeks' greatest asset, capturing cities and earning renown. In the tenth year, however, King Agamemnon seized Briseis, a woman Achilles had claimed as a war prize, and the hero withdrew from battle in rage. His absence proved catastrophic - the Trojans pushed the Greeks back to their ships. Only when his beloved companion Patroclus fell to Hector while wearing Achilles' armor did the hero return to war. His grief transformed into terrible wrath; clad in new divine armor forged by Hephaestus, Achilles slaughtered Trojans by the hundreds, fought the river god Scamander, and finally cornered and killed Hector, dragging his body behind his chariot for days. Yet even in vengeance, Achilles' humanity emerged when he returned Hector's body to King Priam, recognizing their shared grief. Achilles himself fell soon after, struck in his vulnerable heel by an arrow shot by Paris but guided by Apollo. His armor sparked a fatal dispute between Ajax and Odysseus. Achilles represents the archetype of the tragic hero - supremely gifted, knowing his fate, choosing glory over long life, and ultimately undone by the very passion that made him great.",
