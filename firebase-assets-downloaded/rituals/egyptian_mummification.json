  "procedure": "Mummification was performed in specialized workshops called the wabet (pure place) or per-nefer (house of beauty). The process began immediately after death to prevent decomposition in Egypt's hot climate. Embalmers, working under the patronage of Anubis, first purified the body with sacred water. The brain was removed through the nose using hooks, as it was considered unimportant. Internal organs were extracted through a left-flank incision made with a ritual obsidian blade - the person making this cut was symbolically chased away as having violated the body. Organs were preserved separately in canopic jars protected by the four sons of Horus. The emptied body was packed with natron salt and left for 40 days to desiccate completely. After drying, the body was washed, stuffed to restore lifelike appearance, and anointed with precious oils. Wrapping required hundreds of yards of linen, with protective amulets and spells placed between layers. The heart scarab ensured the heart would not testify against the deceased at judgment. Finally, the Opening of the Mouth ceremony restored the mummy's ability to eat, drink, breathe, and speak in the afterlife.",

  "description": "Mummification represents ancient Egypt's most elaborate and enduring funerary practice, a sophisticated 70-day process designed to preserve the body for eternal life. The Egyptians believed that the ka (life force) and ba (personality) required an intact physical form to which they could return. According to mythology, the god Anubis invented mummification when he preserved the body of Osiris after his murder by Set, establishing both the technique and the theological justification for the practice. The process combined practical preservation techniques - evisceration, desiccation with natron salt, and application of resins - with elaborate religious rituals including spells, amulet placement, and the crucial Opening of the Mouth ceremony that animated the mummy for afterlife existence. Different levels of mummification existed based on wealth, from the elaborate royal process taking months to simpler treatments for commoners. This practice persisted for over 3,000 years, producing the thousands of mummies that have fascinated the modern world and provided unprecedented insight into ancient Egyptian medicine, religion, and daily life.",

  "sections": {
    "origins": "Natural mummification in Egypt's arid desert sands preceded artificial techniques by millennia. The earliest Egyptians buried their dead directly in the sand, where the heat and dryness naturally preserved bodies. When elite burials began using coffins and tombs that prevented this natural desiccation, decomposition became a problem. This necessitated the development of artificial mummification techniques by the Old Kingdom (c. 2600 BCE). The mythology attributed the invention to Anubis, who preserved Osiris's murdered body, making the god the patron of embalmers and the archetypal model for resurrection.",
    "attributes": "Egyptian mummification was unique in its theological integration - each step had religious significance beyond mere preservation. The 70-day duration corresponded to the period Sirius (associated with Isis) was invisible below the horizon. The four canopic jars were protected by the four sons of Horus, each safeguarding a specific organ. The heart remained in place because it would be weighed against Ma'at's feather in the afterlife judgment. Amulets provided magical protection during the dangerous journey through the underworld. The wrapping pattern itself encoded protective spells.",
    "significance": "Mummification was central to Egyptian religion's promise of eternal life. Without an intact body, the spiritual components of the person (ka, ba, akh, shadow, name) had no anchor and could not achieve blessed afterlife. This belief drove the enormous investment of resources in mummification and tomb construction that characterized Egyptian civilization. The practice also developed Egyptian understanding of anatomy, chemistry, and preservation techniques that influenced later Mediterranean medicine.",
    "impact": "Mummification profoundly influenced subsequent cultures. Greek visitors like Herodotus documented the practice, spreading knowledge throughout the Mediterranean. Roman Egypt continued mummification with Greco-Roman stylistic additions. Early Christians in Egypt mummified saints' bodies. The practice influenced medieval European approaches to relics. Modern study of mummies has revolutionized our understanding of ancient disease, diet, genetics, and culture. The mummy remains one of ancient Egypt's most iconic and enduring legacies."
