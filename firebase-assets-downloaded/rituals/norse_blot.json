  "description": "The blót\n(Old Norse \"blessing\" or \"sacrifice\") was the central ritual of Norse religion, a communal sacrifice feast honoring the gods and spirits.\nThrough offerings of animals, mead, and food, Norse peoples maintained reciprocal relationships with Odin,\nThor, Freyr, and the land spirits (landvættir), ensuring fertility,\nprosperity, victory in battle, and cosmic order. The ritual combined sacrifice, feasting, and sacred drinking in ceremonies that bound\ncommunities to their gods and to each other.",
