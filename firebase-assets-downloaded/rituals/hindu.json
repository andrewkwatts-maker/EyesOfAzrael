The festival commemorates Lord Rama's return to Ayodhya after fourteen years of exile and his victory over the demon king Ravana. Celebrated across India and the Hindu diaspora with unparalleled fervor, Diwali transforms homes into radiant sanctuaries through the lighting of countless diyas (oil lamps), spectacular fireworks, elaborate rangoli designs, the exchange of sweets and gifts, and devoted worship of Goddess Lakshmi, the divine bestower of wealth and prosperity.",
