  "description": "Diwali (Deepavali, meaning 'row of lights') is the most celebrated festival in Hinduism, a five-day festival of lights symbolizing the victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance. The festival commemorates Lord Rama's triumphant return to Ayodhya after 14 years of exile and his victory over the demon king Ravana, as narrated in the Ramayana. The people of Ayodhya lit thousands of oil lamps (diyas) to welcome their beloved prince, and this tradition continues today. Diwali is also associated with the worship of Lakshmi, goddess of wealth and prosperity, who is believed to visit clean, well-lit homes to bestow blessings. For Jains, Diwali marks Lord Mahavira's attainment of moksha. For Sikhs, it celebrates Guru Hargobind's release from Mughal imprisonment. The festival has become one of the largest and most important cultural celebrations in the Indian subcontinent and among Hindu diaspora communities worldwide, marked by elaborate decorations, fireworks, feasts, gift-giving, and religious ceremonies that create an atmosphere of joy, renewal, and spiritual aspiration.",

On Choti Diwali, an early morning oil bath purifies the body while lamps ward off evil spirits. The main Diwali day involves creating rangoli patterns at entrances to welcome Lakshmi, decorating with flowers and lights, and performing elaborate Lakshmi puja at dusk when the goddess is believed to descend to earth. The puja involves invoking Ganesha and Lakshmi together (wealth requires wisdom to manage), offering flowers, sweets, and incense while chanting mantras. After puja, diyas are lit throughout the home, leaving no dark corner, and placed outside to guide Lakshmi. Fireworks celebrate the joy of light. Days four and five honor Krishna and family bonds respectively.",

      "title": "Origins & History",
      "content": "Diwali's origins are ancient and multifaceted. The festival's association with Rama's return to Ayodhya is its most popular origin story, linking it to the Ramayana epic (c. 5th century BCE). However, Diwali was also traditionally an autumn harvest festival, celebrating the last harvest before winter. The worship of Lakshmi during this time reflects agricultural prosperity themes. Historical records show Diwali was celebrated in India at least since the 1st century CE. The festival absorbed various regional traditions: in Bengal, Kali is worshipped; in Gujarat, the new year begins with Diwali; in South India, the focus is on Krishna's defeat of Narakasura. Over time, Diwali became Hinduism's most prominent festival, spreading with Indian diaspora communities worldwide."

    "attributesAndCharacteristics": {
      "title": "Attributes & Characteristics",
      "content": "Diwali is characterized by the triumph of light over darkness at multiple levels - literal (lamps dispelling night), moral (good conquering evil), and spiritual (knowledge overcoming ignorance). The festival emphasizes themes of renewal: homes are cleaned and renovated, new clothes purchased, debts settled, and relationships renewed through gift-giving. Lakshmi worship reflects the desire for prosperity, but traditional teaching emphasizes that true wealth includes spiritual riches. The festival's communal nature strengthens family and social bonds. The five-day structure moves from practical concerns (cleaning, purchasing) through religious devotion to family celebration, creating a comprehensive renewal experience."

    "mythologicalSignificance": {
      "title": "Mythological Significance",
      "content": "Diwali encodes multiple mythological narratives. Rama's return represents dharma (righteousness) restored after exile and the defeat of adharma (unrighteousness) represented by Ravana. The lighting of lamps symbolizes the people's joy but also the spiritual light Rama brought back to the world. Lakshmi's worship connects to her emergence from the ocean churning (Samudra Manthan), linking prosperity to cosmic events. In some regions, Diwali marks Krishna's defeat of the demon Narakasura, another victory of divine over demonic forces. The Jain association with Mahavira's moksha adds a dimension of spiritual liberation to the festival's symbolism."

      "title": "Cultural Impact",
      "content": "Diwali has become India's most important cultural export and is now celebrated by non-Hindus worldwide as a festival of lights and goodwill. Major cities across the globe host public Diwali celebrations. The festival drives significant economic activity through purchases of gold, clothing, gifts, and fireworks. It has influenced other cultures' autumn celebrations and is increasingly recognized as an official holiday in countries with significant Indian populations. Diwali's emphasis on light, family, generosity, and new beginnings resonates with universal human values, giving it broad appeal beyond its religious origins."
