  "description": "Krishna (Sanskrit: 'the dark one' or 'all-attractive') is one of the most beloved and widely worshipped deities in Hinduism, revered as the eighth avatar of Vishnu and, in many traditions, as the Supreme Being himself (Svayam Bhagavan). His life story spans from mischievous butter-stealing child (Bala Krishna) in Vrindavan, to divine flute-player whose music enchanted the gopis (cowherd women), to the wise charioteer and teacher of Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita. Krishna's teachings in the Gita - on dharma (duty), karma yoga (action), bhakti yoga (devotion), and jnana yoga (knowledge) - form the philosophical cornerstone of Hindu thought. His romantic love with Radha symbolizes the soul's longing for union with the divine. Krishna killed the demon Kamsa, participated in the Mahabharata war as a strategist, and established the kingdom of Dwaraka. His worship through bhakti devotion, especially in the ISKCON and Gaudiya Vaishnava traditions, emphasizes loving surrender to God.",
