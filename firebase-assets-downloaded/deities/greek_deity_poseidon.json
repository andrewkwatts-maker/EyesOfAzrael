  "description": "One of the three great sons of Kronos who divided the cosmos, Poseidon commands the vast oceans, shakes the earth with his mighty trident, and created the first horses. Known as the Earth-Shaker and Lord of the Seas, he embodies the dual nature of water itself: life-giving sustenance and terrifying destruction. Sailors, fishermen, and coastal peoples throughout the ancient world honored this tempestuous deity.",
