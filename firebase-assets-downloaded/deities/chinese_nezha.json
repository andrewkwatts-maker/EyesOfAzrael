  "description": "Nezha, the Third Lotus Prince (San Tai Zi), is one of the most beloved and dynamic deities in Chinese mythology, representing youthful rebellion, fierce protection, and the complex tensions between filial duty and individual conscience. Born to the military commander Li Jing at Chentang Pass after an extraordinarily long pregnancy of three years and six months, Nezha emerged not as an ordinary infant but as a ball of flesh that his startled father attacked with a sword, revealing a fully-formed child wearing a golden bracelet and wrapped in red silk. From birth, Nezha was marked for greatness, receiving divine weapons and training from the immortal Taiyi Zhenren. His most famous mythological episode involves killing the Dragon King of the Eastern Sea's third son, Ao Bing, during a bathtime confrontation at the sea, then skinning the dragon to make a belt for his father. When the four Dragon Kings threatened to flood Chentang Pass and demanded Li Jing's life in retribution, the young Nezha committed suicide by disemboweling himself, cutting his own flesh to return it to his mother and his bones to his father, thereby absolving his parents of guilt. His master Taiyi Zhenren later resurrected him using lotus flowers, giving him a body of lotus roots that made him even more powerful. Nezha subsequently became a central figure in the Investiture of the Gods narrative, fighting alongside Jiang Ziya against the tyrannical King Zhou of Shang. In Taoist tradition, Nezha is worshipped as a protective deity who guards against demons and evil spirits, particularly revered in Taiwan and Southeast Asian Chinese communities where his temples attract devotees seeking protection for children and success in endeavors requiring courage.",
