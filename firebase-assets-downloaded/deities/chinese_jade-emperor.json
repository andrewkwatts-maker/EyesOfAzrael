    "overview": "The Jade Emperor's mythology reflects the Chinese conception of divine governance as mirroring earthly imperial administration. Unlike many supreme deities who are primordial creators, the Jade Emperor earned his position through merit—cultivating perfection through countless incarnations until he achieved supreme enlightenment and was elected ruler of heaven by all the gods.",

        "title": "Ascension to Supreme Rule",
        "description": "After 1,750 eons of cultivation (each eon lasting 129,600 years), the mortal prince who would become the Jade Emperor achieved perfect virtue. When the previous supreme god retired, all deities unanimously elected him as the new ruler. His authority derives not from force but from unparalleled moral perfection."

This story illustrates the Jade Emperor's role as administrator rather than warrior—he delegates tasks to specialists, embodying wise rulership."
