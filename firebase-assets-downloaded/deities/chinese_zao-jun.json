  "description": "Zao Jun (literally 'Stove Master'), commonly known as the Kitchen God or Stove God, is one of the most universally worshipped deities in Chinese folk religion, present in virtually every traditional Chinese household regardless of regional or sectarian differences. This domestic deity resides in the kitchen, the heart of the Chinese home, where he observes and records the moral conduct of family members throughout the year. His position represents the intersection of the celestial bureaucracy and everyday domestic life, serving as the Jade Emperor's representative within each household. The most significant aspect of Zao Jun worship occurs during the Little New Year (Xiao Nian), typically on the 23rd or 24th day of the 12th lunar month, when the Kitchen God ascends to Heaven to deliver his annual report on each family's behavior to the Jade Emperor. This report influences the family's fortunes for the coming year, making the Kitchen God's favor crucial. To ensure a favorable report, families engage in elaborate rituals: they smear the lips of Zao Jun's paper image with honey, maltose, or other sweet substances to sweeten his words (or, according to some traditions, to stick his lips together so he cannot speak ill); they offer wine to make him tipsy and forgetful of family misdeeds; and finally they burn the paper image along with paper money and a paper horse to send him on his heavenly journey. A new image is installed on New Year's Eve when Zao Jun returns with the family's allotted fortune. The Kitchen God's origin story, involving a man named Zhang Lang who abandoned his virtuous wife only to end up as a blind beggar fed by her charity, illustrates themes of karma, remorse, and redemption central to Chinese moral philosophy. His wife's forgiveness and his subsequent self-immolation in shame led to his apotheosis as guardian of the hearth, forever watching over family conduct. This narrative serves as a moral lesson about the consequences of wrongdoing and the possibility of redemption through recognition of one's faults.",
