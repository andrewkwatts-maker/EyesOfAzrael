  "description": "The antlered lord of wild places and untamed nature, Cernunnos is one of the most ancient and mysterious Celtic deities. He sits in meditation posture at the threshold between the civilized and wild worlds, master of all beasts, guardian of the deep forest, and keeper of the sacred balance between life and death. His presence radiates the primal power of nature itself - both nurturing and terrifying, abundant and dangerous.",
