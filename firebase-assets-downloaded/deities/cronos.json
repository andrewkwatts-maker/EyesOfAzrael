  "description": "Cronos (also spelled Kronos or Cronus) was the youngest and most powerful of the twelve Titans, ruling over the Golden Age before being overthrown by his own children. As lord of time and harvest, he embodied both agricultural abundance and the inexorable passage of ages. His most notorious act - devouring his own children to prevent the prophecy of his downfall - has become one of mythology's most powerful symbols of time consuming all things.",
