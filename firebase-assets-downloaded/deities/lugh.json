  "description": "The Shining One, master of all skills, Lugh is the radiant god of light, sovereignty, and manifold abilities. When he arrived at Tara, he offered every skill in turn, only to be told each was already represented - until he asked if any single person possessed ALL skills. None did, and so he earned his place. He is the divine craftsman, warrior, poet, and king - the embodiment of excellence in all pursuits and the brilliant light that guides civilization.",
