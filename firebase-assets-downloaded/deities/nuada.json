  "description": "King of the Tuatha Dé Danann, He of the Silver Hand. When Nuada lost his hand in battle, he lost his kingship - for a king must be unblemished. But the physician Dian Cecht crafted him a hand of silver, and later Dian Cecht's son made him a hand of flesh. Nuada embodies the principle of rightful sovereignty and the sacred relationship between king and land. His silver hand is a symbol of both limitation overcome and the price of leadership.",
