      "content": "Nuada Airgetlam was the first king of the Tuatha De Danann, the divine race that descended upon Ireland in a great fleet shrouded in magical mist. His lineage traces to Echtach, son of Etarlam, connecting him to the primordial divine ancestry of the Tuatha De. As their sovereign, Nuada led his people from their mystical northern islands (often identified with the otherworldly realms) to claim Ireland from the Fir Bolg. He possessed one of the Four Treasures of the Tuatha De Danann: the Claíomh Solais (Sword of Light), brought from the city of Findias, which no enemy could escape once it was drawn."
    },
    "mythology": {
      "title": "Mythology",
      "content": "Nuada's defining myth is the First Battle of Moytura against the Fir Bolg. Though the Tuatha De Danann won, Nuada lost his right arm to the Fir Bolg champion Sreng. Under the law that a king must be physically unblemished (a doctrine called 'ríge fri sofholta'), Nuada was forced to abdicate. The half-Fomorian Bres became king but proved tyrannical. The physician-god Dian Cecht crafted Nuada a functional arm of silver, hence his epithet 'Airgetlám' (Silver Hand/Arm). Later, Dian Cecht's son Miach grew Nuada a new arm of flesh, fully restoring him. Nuada reclaimed his throne and led his people in the Second Battle of Moytura against the Fomorians. Though Lugh ultimately defeated the Fomorian champion Balor, Nuada fell in that great battle, slain by Balor's deadly eye before Lugh could intervene."

    "attributes": {
      "title": "Attributes",
      "content": "Nuada embodies the ideal of sacred kingship - the king who is one with the land and whose wholeness ensures the prosperity of his people. His silver hand represents both the price of sovereignty and the possibility of divine restoration. The Sword of Light he carries is invincible, symbolizing the king's role as final arbiter of justice. Though a warrior, Nuada's greatest quality is his willingness to step aside for the good of his people - abdicating when blemished, returning only when whole. He corresponds to the Romano-British god Nodens, worshipped at Lydney in Gloucestershire, associated with healing, the sea, and hunting."
    },
    "culturalRole": {
      "title": "Cultural Role",
      "content": "Nuada represents the Celtic concept of the king as sacred intermediary between gods and people. His story illustrates the harsh requirements of divine kingship - the ruler must be perfect in body to channel the land's fertility. The silver hand became an enduring symbol of Ireland's mythic heritage and the transformative power of the gods. Medieval Irish genealogies traced royal lineages back to Nuada, legitimizing dynastic claims through divine descent. His worship likely continued into the Romano-British period as Nodens, whose temple at Lydney featured healing rituals and votive offerings. Nuada's ultimate sacrifice in battle against the forces of chaos (the Fomorians) established the pattern of the king who dies defending his people."
