Together with Tepeu (another creator god), Q'uq'umatz floated upon the primordial waters in the darkness, wrapped in blue-green quetzal feathers.",
      "creationWords": "Through the power of their word alone, these creator gods brought the earth into being: 'Let it be done! Let the void be filled! Let the water recede and make a void, let the earth appear and become solid.' Mountains rose from the waters, rivers flowed, and the face of the earth became visible."
