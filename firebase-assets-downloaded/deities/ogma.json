  "description": "The champion of the Tuatha Dé Danann, god of eloquence, writing, and strength. Ogma is credited with inventing the Ogham alphabet, the sacred script of the druids. He binds enemies with his words and his chains, wielding language as both weapon and art. He represents the union of physical might and intellectual power, the warrior-poet ideal of Celtic culture, where the strongest arm is paired with the wisest tongue.",
