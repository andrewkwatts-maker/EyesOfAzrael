A giantess by birth, she came to Asgard seeking vengeance for her father Thiazi's death and departed with a husband - Njord, the sea god, chosen by his beautiful feet. Their marriage failed due to incompatible natures: she could not bear the seagulls at his seaside home Noatun, and he could not endure the wolves howling at her mountain hall Thrymheim. Skadi represents the harsh, wild beauty of winter and the fierce independence of the mountain wilderness. The name 'Scandinavia' may derive from her name, marking her as a goddess of profound regional importance.",
