  "description": "Saint Michael the Archangel (Hebrew: Mikha'el, 'Who is like God?') is the commander of the heavenly armies, the champion who cast Satan from heaven, and the defender of God's people. In Scripture, he appears as 'one of the chief princes' (Daniel 10:13), the 'great prince who protects your people' (Daniel 12:1), and the leader of the angelic forces who defeat the dragon in the War in Heaven (Revelation 12:7-9). In Jude 1:9, he contends with the devil over the body of Moses. Michael is venerated across Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as the supreme warrior angel. He is invoked for protection in spiritual warfare, deliverance from evil, and defense of the dying. The Roman Catholic Church celebrates his feast on September 29 (Michaelmas), and he is patron of soldiers, police, and the sick.",
