  "description": "Thanatos is the Greek personification of death, specifically the gentle, peaceful death that comes at the natural end of life. Unlike the violent death brought by the Keres (death spirits), Thanatos represents the quiet release of the soul from the body. Twin brother of Hypnos (Sleep), son of Nyx (Night) and Erebus (Darkness), Thanatos dwells in the Underworld but emerges to claim mortal souls when their time has come. He appears as a young man with wings, often carrying an inverted torch symbolizing extinguished life, or a sword for cutting the hair of the dying. In mythology, he was famously outwitted twice - by Sisyphus who chained him, and by Heracles who wrestled him to save Alcestis. The Greeks viewed Thanatos with both fear and acceptance, recognizing death as the inevitable companion of life.",
  "summary": "Thanatos is the Greek god of peaceful, non-violent death. Twin of Hypnos (Sleep) and son of Nyx (Night), he represents the gentle end of mortal life. Though feared, he was viewed as a necessary force, and his touch brought merciful release rather than violent end.",
  "archetype_description": "Thanatos embodies the Death Deity archetype - the divine personification of mortality and the transition from life to death. As the agent of peaceful death, he represents the inevitability and even mercy of mortality.",
