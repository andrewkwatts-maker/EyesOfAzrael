      "sacred_sites": "Aphrodite 's primary cult centers were on Cyprus (especially Paphos, where she was said to have come ashore) and Cythera. Major temples also existed at Corinth (where temple prostitution was practiced), Athens, and throughout the Greek world. Her sanctuaries were often near the sea or in gardens.",
      "prayers": "Aphrodite was invoked for matters of love, marriage, fertility, and beauty. Prayers often appealed to her power over desire and her ability to grant favor in romantic pursuits. Sailors also prayed to her for safe sea voyages, honoring her birth from the sea.",
      "offerings": "Worshippers offered flowers (especially roses and myrtle), perfumes, incense, doves, and personal items of beauty. Her altars received garlands and wreaths. Unlike gods receiving blood sacrifices, offerings to Aphrodite emphasized beauty, fragrance, and sensual pleasure.",
      "festivals": [
        "Aphrodisia: Celebrated throughout Greece in midsummer, honoring Aphrodite with processions, offerings of flowers, and private celebrations of love and beauty.",
        "Adonia: Women-only festival mourning Adonis and celebrating his resurrection, featuring gardens planted in his honor that quickly bloomed and withered."

Women called upon her in matters of fertility, childbirth, and family welfare. Initiates of the Mysteries invoked her for spiritual understanding and hope for a blessed afterlife. The kykeon ritual drink was prepared and consumed in her honor during the Mysteries.",

The sanctuary complex included the Telesterion (hall of initiation) where the secret rites were performed. Major temples also existed on Sicily (where Persephone was said to have been abducted), Hermione, Thebes, and throughout the Greek world. Rural shrines marked the boundaries of cultivated fields."

      "offerings": "Craftsmen dedicated their first works and tools to Hephaestus . Offerings included worked metal objects, especially those demonstrating exceptional skill. Fire offerings were common. In Athens, a sacred fire burned perpetually in his honor. Donkeys were occasionally sacrificed, as they were his sacred animal (possibly because smiths used them to power bellows).",
      "prayers": "Blacksmiths, sculptors, metalworkers, jewelers, and all craftspeople invoked Hephaestus before beginning work, asking for skill, inspiration, and success in their craft. Prayers emphasized technical mastery, creative ingenuity, and the transformation of raw materials into objects of beauty and utility. He was also invoked for protection from fire and volcanic eruptions.",

        "Hephaistia: Annual festival on Lemnos featuring torch races and athletic contests, celebrating his connection to fire and craft",
        "Chalkeia: Joint festival with Athena in late autumn, honoring metalworkers, potters, and all craftspeople",

      ],
      "sacred_sites": "Hephaestus was worshipped primarily in industrial and volcanic regions. Athens honored him alongside Athena as patron of crafts; the Hephaisteion temple still stands in the Athenian Agora. Lemnos, where he fell from heaven, maintained major cult centers. His association with volcanoes made Mt. Etna in Sicily and volcanic islands sacred to him - said to be sites of his forges."

His most famous temple stood at Cape Sounion , perched dramatically on cliffs overlooking the Aegean Sea, where sailors offered prayers for safe voyages. The sanctuary at Corinth (Isthmia) hosted the Isthmian Games in his honor. Other major cult centers included Helike (destroyed by earthquake and tsunami in 373 BCE, seen as divine punishment), Onchestos, Tainaron (with a legendary entrance to the underworld ), and temples throughout the Peloponnese.",

Black bulls and stallions were particularly sacred offerings to Poseidon , sometimes drowned in the sea rather than burned on altars. Fishermen offered first catches, and coastal cities held regular processions to his shrines. Pine branches, sea salt, and water were used in purification rituals. After safe voyages, sailors dedicated votive anchors, ship models, and oars at his temples.",
