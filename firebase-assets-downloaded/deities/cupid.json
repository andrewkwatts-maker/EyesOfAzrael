  "description": "Cupid (Latin: Cupido, meaning 'Desire') is the Roman god of erotic love, desire, and attraction, equivalent to the Greek Eros. Depicted as a winged youth or mischievous child armed with a bow and arrows, Cupid possesses the power to make both gods and mortals fall irresistibly in love by piercing them with his golden-tipped arrows, or to repel love with his lead-tipped arrows. Son of Venus, goddess of love, and Mars, god of war (in the most common tradition), Cupid embodies the irresistible and often irrational force of desire that conquers even the most powerful beings. His most celebrated mythology is the tale of Cupid and Psyche, preserved in Apuleius's 'Metamorphoses' (2nd century CE), wherein Cupid falls in love with the mortal princess Psyche but must hide his identity. When Psyche disobeys and looks upon him, Cupid flees, and Psyche must complete seemingly impossible tasks set by the jealous Venus before being reunited with her divine lover and achieving immortality. This tale has been interpreted as an allegory of the soul's journey toward divine love and has profoundly influenced Western art, literature, and concepts of romantic love.",

    "origins": "Cupid originated as the Roman adoption and adaptation of the Greek god Eros. While early Greek Eros was conceived as a primordial cosmic force, the Romans inherited the later Hellenistic conception of Eros/Cupid as a mischievous winged youth. Roman poets, especially Ovid, developed Cupid's mythology extensively, emphasizing his power over gods and mortals and his role as his mother Venus's agent. The Cupid and Psyche tale, though preserved in Latin by Apuleius, likely derives from earlier Greek sources and represents the fullest narrative development of Cupid's character.",
    "attributes": "Cupid possesses several distinctive divine attributes: eternal youth (whether depicted as a child or adolescent); beautiful wings that enable swift flight; a magical bow and quiver of arrows, with golden arrows to inspire love and lead arrows to cause aversion; invisibility when he chooses; immunity to other gods' power over him; and irresistible charm. Unlike many deities bound by cosmic laws, Cupid acts with apparent caprice, making his interventions unpredictable and sometimes cruel. His power extends over all beings - even Jupiter, king of the gods, is not immune to love's arrows.",
    "significance": "Cupid's cultural significance extends far beyond Roman religion into the foundations of Western concepts of romantic love. The Cupid and Psyche narrative has been interpreted philosophically (the soul's union with divine love), psychologically (stages of relationship development), and spiritually (trials leading to apotheosis). Renaissance and Baroque art made Cupid one of the most depicted mythological figures. In modern culture, Cupid remains the primary symbol of romantic love, especially associated with Valentine's Day, though often sentimentalized far beyond his complex ancient character. The image of the cherubic Cupid with bow and arrow has become perhaps the most recognized symbol of love in Western culture."
