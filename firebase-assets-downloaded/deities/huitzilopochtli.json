      "content": "Huitzilopochtli was born in miraculous circumstances on Coatepec ('Serpent Mountain'). His mother Coatlicue, the earth goddess, found a ball of feathers while sweeping a temple and tucked it into her bosom, becoming mysteriously pregnant. Her existing children - the 400 Huitznahua (stars) and their sister Coyolxauhqui (the moon) - were enraged and plotted to kill their mother for this perceived dishonor. As they attacked, Huitzilopochtli burst fully formed from his mother's womb, wielding the Xiuhcoatl (fire serpent). He dismembered Coyolxauhqui and cast her remains down the mountainside, then pursued and scattered the 400 stars. This myth represents the daily victory of the sun over the moon and stars at dawn, a cosmic battle that must be continually renewed through sacrifice."

    "mythology": {
      "title": "Mythology",
      "content": "Huitzilopochtli was the patron deity of the Mexica (Aztecs), who believed he had guided their migration from the legendary homeland of Aztlan to the valley of Mexico. According to tradition, he instructed them to settle where they found an eagle perched on a cactus devouring a serpent - the image that became Mexico's national emblem. Unlike other Mesoamerican deities with ancient pan-regional roots, Huitzilopochtli was specifically Mexica, his cult rising with their imperial power. The great Templo Mayor in Tenochtitlan was dedicated jointly to him and Tlaloc, with Huitzilopochtli's shrine on the south side representing the dry season and war, while Tlaloc's represented the wet season and agriculture. The massive skull rack (tzompantli) nearby displayed the heads of sacrificial victims offered to feed the sun."

      "content": "Huitzilopochtli is depicted as a hummingbird or a warrior wearing a hummingbird headdress - the hummingbird representing the souls of fallen warriors who follow the sun across the sky. His body is painted blue (the color of the south and sky), and he carries the Xiuhcoatl, a weapon of lightning and fire, along with his shield and darts. He is the young, vigorous sun at its zenith, requiring constant nourishment of human blood and hearts to maintain his strength for the daily battle against darkness. Aztec warriors believed that dying in battle or on the sacrifice stone was the most honorable death, allowing them to accompany Huitzilopochtli on his journey. The eagle warriors were especially associated with his cult, as the eagle was his sacred animal representing the sun."

    "culturalRole": {
      "title": "Cultural Role",
      "content": "Huitzilopochtli's cult was central to Aztec statecraft and warfare. The 'Flower Wars' (xochiyaoyotl) were ritual conflicts designed primarily to capture prisoners for sacrifice rather than territorial conquest. His major festival, Panquetzaliztli, occurred in December and involved extensive sacrifice, ritual combat, and the renewal of his sacred fire. The priesthood of Huitzilopochtli wielded enormous political power, and his temple dominated Tenochtitlan's sacred precinct. After the Spanish Conquest, his worship was completely suppressed as the conquistadors and missionaries viewed the sacrificial complex as demonic. Unlike some Mesoamerican deities that were syncretized with Catholic saints, Huitzilopochtli's associations with human sacrifice allowed no such accommodation. Today, he remains a symbol of Aztec heritage, depicted in Mexican art and studied as one of the most distinctive deities of the pre-Columbian Americas."

  "description": "Huitzilopochtli ('Hummingbird of the South') is the Aztec god of war, the sun, and the patron deity of the Mexica people. Born fully armed from his mother Coatlicue on Coatepec mountain, he immediately slew his sister Coyolxauhqui (the moon) and scattered his 400 brothers (the stars), establishing the cosmic pattern of the sun's daily victory over darkness. His cult required constant human sacrifice to nourish the sun for its perpetual battle against night - warriors captured in the Flower Wars were offered on the altars of the great Templo Mayor in Tenochtitlan. Depicted as a warrior with hummingbird feathers and blue-painted skin, wielding the Xiuhcoatl (fire serpent), Huitzilopochtli embodied Aztec military prowess and imperial destiny. He guided the Mexica migration from Aztlan to the Valley of Mexico, where they founded Tenochtitlan at the site where an eagle perched on a cactus devouring a serpent - an image that remains Mexico's national symbol. Unlike pan-Mesoamerican deities, Huitzilopochtli was distinctly Mexica, his power rising and falling with their empire.",
