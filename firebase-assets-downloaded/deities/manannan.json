  "description": "Son of the Sea, guardian of the threshold between worlds, Manannán is the enigmatic god of oceans, mist, and magic. He rides a self-navigating boat across the waves, wears a cloak of invisibility, and guards the entrance to the Otherworld. Master of illusion and shapeshifting, he moves between realms with ease, bringing wealth from beneath the waves and knowledge from beyond mortal understanding. The sea is his domain, and mystery is his nature.",
