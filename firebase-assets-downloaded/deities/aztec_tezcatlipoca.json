Jealous of Quetzalcoatl's moral authority and opposed to his ban on human sacrifice, Tezcatlipoca appeared at Quetzalcoatl's court in various disguises. First, he showed Quetzalcoatl his reflection in the obsidian smoking mirror, causing the god to see his own aging face and despair. Then he tricked Quetzalcoatl into drinking pulque until intoxicated. In his drunken state, Quetzalcoatl committed incest with his sister Quetzalpetlatl. Upon waking and realizing what he had done, Quetzalcoatl was so overcome with shame that he abdicated his throne and went into exile.",

He was treated as a god made flesh - given fine clothes, trained in music, and attended by servants. For the final month, he was married to four young women representing goddesses. On the day of Toxcatl, he walked alone to a small temple, breaking a clay flute on each step - symbols of the pleasures he was leaving behind. At the summit, he was sacrificed, his heart offered to the very god he had embodied."

While Quetzalcoatl receives more positive attention, Tezcatlipoca was arguably the supreme deity - the all-seeing lord of fate whose obsidian mirror technology influenced later Mesoamerican and even European magical traditions. Modern scholarship recognizes him as a deity of transformation and change, not simply evil. He tests humanity, reveals truth through trials, and reminds us that nothing - not beauty, not power, not even the gods themselves - is permanent. His lessons about accepting fate and the impermanence of earthly pleasures resonate across cultures.",
