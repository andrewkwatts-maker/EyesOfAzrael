  "description": "The Four Dragon Kings (Si Hai Long Wang) are the supreme divine rulers of the seas, rivers, and all bodies of water in Chinese mythology, wielding absolute authority over weather, rainfall, and the creatures of the deep. Each king governs one of the Four Seas corresponding to the cardinal directions, dwelling in magnificent crystal palaces beneath the waves where they hold court over vast underwater kingdoms populated by fish soldiers, crab generals, and tortoise ministers. Serving under the celestial hierarchy of the Jade Emperor, these serpentine deities regulate the waters that sustain all life, answering prayers for rain during drought and calming storms that threaten the land. Their worship remains one of the most important water-related cults in Chinese folk religion, with temples along every major waterway and coastline.",
