  "description": "The High Priestess (II) is the second card of the Major Arcana and represents the feminine pillar of the mysteries, embodying intuition, hidden knowledge, and the gateway to the unconscious mind. In the Rider-Waite-Smith deck, she sits between two pillars - the black pillar Boaz (severity) and the white pillar Jachin (mercy) - which recall the entrance to Solomon's Temple and represent the duality she transcends. Behind her hangs a veil decorated with pomegranates (symbols of Persephone and the underworld), concealing the mysterious waters of the unconscious. On her lap rests a scroll partially hidden, marked TORA (Torah, divine law), indicating that she possesses wisdom but reveals it only to the initiated. The crescent moon at her feet connects her to lunar cycles, feminine mysteries, and the ebb and flow of intuition. Unlike the active, outward-focused Magician who precedes her, the High Priestess represents receptivity, stillness, and the wisdom that comes from looking inward. She is the virgin in the archetypal sense - complete unto herself, not defined by relationship to the masculine. In readings, she calls for patience, trust in intuition, and attention to dreams and inner knowing. She guards the threshold between the conscious and unconscious, the known and unknown, and invites the seeker to pass through the veil into deeper understanding. Historically, this card was called La Papesse (The Popess) in early Italian decks, possibly representing the legendary Pope Joan or the Cathar feminine divine principle. The Golden Dawn tradition associated her with the Hebrew letter Gimel and the path connecting Keter (Crown) to Tiferet (Beauty) on the Tree of Life, making her the channel through which divine wisdom descends into the heart of creation.",
