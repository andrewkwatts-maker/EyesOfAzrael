A massive stone sculpture of Tlaloc, weighing 168 tons, was controversially moved from the town of Coatlinchan to Mexico City in 1964, where it now stands outside the National Museum of Anthropology. Local legend claims that on the day the statue was moved, a massive rainstorm struck Mexico City despite it being the dry season - as if Tlaloc was expressing his displeasure. This story reflects the ongoing cultural connection between modern Mexicans and their ancient religious heritage. In indigenous communities that maintain traditional practices, offerings to rain and mountain spirits continue, representing an unbroken thread connecting contemporary Mexico to its Mesoamerican past.",
