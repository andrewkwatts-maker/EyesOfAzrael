  "description": "Hestia is the Greek goddess of the hearth, home, family, and sacred fire. As the firstborn of the Titans Cronus and Rhea, she was the first to be swallowed and the last to be regurgitated, making her both eldest and youngest of the Olympians. She famously rejected marriage proposals from both Poseidon and Apollo, swearing eternal virginity by Zeus's head, and in return Zeus granted her the first and last portion of every sacrifice. Though she has few myths of her own, Hestia's importance was fundamental - every home had a hearth sacred to her, every city maintained a public hearth with an eternal flame, and her blessing was invoked before every meal and sacrifice. Her quiet, stabilizing presence represented the center of family life and civic order.",

      "content": "Hestia was the firstborn child of the Titans Cronus and Rhea, making her the eldest of the Olympian generation. When Cronus swallowed his children to prevent the prophecy of his overthrow, Hestia was the first consumed. After Zeus forced Cronus to regurgitate his siblings, Hestia emerged last - thus she is paradoxically both the eldest and youngest. This unique position reflects her liminal nature as goddess of the threshold between inside and outside, family and stranger, mortal and divine. Some later traditions replaced her among the Twelve Olympians with Dionysus, but this reflects her humble, non-competitive nature rather than diminished importance."

    "mythology": {
      "title": "Mythology",
      "content": "Unlike most Olympians, Hestia appears in few dramatic myths, reflecting her peaceful, stable nature. Her most significant story involves rejecting marriage. Both Poseidon and Apollo desired her as wife, threatening conflict among the gods. To preserve peace, Hestia swore by Zeus's head to remain a virgin forever. Pleased by her selflessness, Zeus granted her exceptional honors: the first and last libation at every feast, a portion of every sacrifice, and the central place in every home and temple. In one tradition, she voluntarily gave up her seat among the Twelve Olympians to Dionysus to prevent conflict, preferring to tend the eternal hearth of Olympus itself."

      "title": "Attributes",
      "content": "Hestia embodies stability, warmth, and domestic harmony. She is depicted as a modest, veiled woman of graceful beauty, often seated and always fully clothed - contrasting with the revealing depictions of other goddesses. Her eternal virginity represents purity, self-sufficiency, and devotion to her sacred duties. The hearth fire, never allowed to go out, symbolized the continuity of family and state. Unlike other Olympians who traveled and intervened in mortal affairs, Hestia remained at the center, her stillness providing the axis around which divine and human life revolved. She represents the sacred hospitality (xenia) that Greeks held as a fundamental virtue."

    "culturalRole": {
      "title": "Cultural Role",
      "content": "Hestia's worship was woven into the fabric of daily Greek life. Every home centered on a hearth sacred to her, where fire was kept perpetually burning. Meals began and ended with offerings to Hestia. New brides were led around the hearth to be received into their new family. Newborn children were carried around the hearth in a ceremony called amphidromia, placing them under her protection. Each city maintained a public hearth (prytaneion) with an eternal flame, from which colonists carried fire to establish new settlements. The Romans knew her as Vesta, whose Vestal Virgins tended Rome's sacred fire for over a thousand years. Hestia's legacy endures in the word 'hearth' itself - the emotional and physical center of home."
