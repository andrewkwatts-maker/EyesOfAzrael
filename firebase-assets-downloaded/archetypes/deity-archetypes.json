  "definition": "Deity archetypes are recurring patterns of divine beings that appear across world mythologies. These universal figures represent fundamental aspects of human experience, cosmic forces, and cultural values. From the Sky Father to the Earth Mother, from the Trickster to the Death God, these archetypes reveal how different cultures have understood and personified the forces that shape existence.",
  "description": "Deity archetypes represent the universal patterns of divine beings found across world mythologies. These recurring figures embody cosmic forces (creation, destruction, celestial bodies), human concerns (war, love, death, wisdom), and fundamental dualities (order/chaos, masculine/feminine, life/death). By studying these archetypes, we discover how different cultures have addressed the same existential questions through their gods and goddesses.",
