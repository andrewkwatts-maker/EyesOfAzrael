  "displayName": "Fire - The Transformative Element",
  "definition": "Fire represents the archetypal force of transformation, purification, and illumination across human cultures. As one of the four classical elements, fire embodies the dynamic principle of change - neither creating nor destroying matter but fundamentally altering its form and releasing energy in the process. The fire archetype appears universally in mythology as both beneficent giver of civilization and terrifying agent of destruction, reflecting humanity's ambivalent relationship with this elemental power that lifted us above other animals while also threatening our existence.",
