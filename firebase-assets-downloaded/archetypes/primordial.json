  "definition": "The Primordial Being represents the ancient powers that existed before the ordered cosmos came into existence. These entities embody the primeval chaos, formless waters, or infinite void from which all creation emerged. Neither gods nor mortals in the conventional sense, they are the raw material of existence itself - often defeated, transformed, or sacrificed so that the ordered universe could come into being. Their legacy persists in every creation myth as the necessary precondition for cosmic order.",
