  "name": "The World Tree",
  "displayName": "The World Tree (Axis Mundi)",
  "description": "The World Tree stands as one of the most profound and universal archetypes in human mythology, appearing across virtually every major cultural tradition as the cosmic axis (axis mundi) connecting the realms of existence. This sacred tree serves as the structural spine of the cosmos, with its roots reaching into the underworld, its trunk occupying the middle earth, and its branches extending into the heavens. The World Tree represents the interconnection of all planes of existence, the cycle of life and death, the source of wisdom and cosmic order, and humanity's place within the greater scheme of creation. From the Norse Yggdrasil to the Hindu Ashvattha, from the Mayan Ceiba to the Mesopotamian Huluppu, this archetype reveals humanity's intuitive understanding of cosmic structure and sacred geography.",
  "definition": "A cosmic tree that serves as the central axis of the universe, connecting the underworld, earth, and heavens while symbolizing the totality of existence, the source of life, and the path between realms.",
  "origins": {
    "universalAppearance": "The World Tree archetype appears independently across cultures with no direct contact, suggesting it arises from deep structures of human consciousness or universal observations of nature. Trees' vertical growth, seasonal cycles, and life-giving properties naturally suggested cosmic symbolism.",
    "psychologicalBasis": "Carl Jung identified the World Tree as a manifestation of the collective unconscious, representing the Self and the process of individuation. The tree's structure mirrors human anatomy (spine as trunk) and psychological development (roots in unconscious, crown in higher consciousness).",
    "shamanicOrigins": "Many scholars connect the World Tree to shamanic traditions, where it serves as the path for the shaman's soul journey between worlds during trance states."
