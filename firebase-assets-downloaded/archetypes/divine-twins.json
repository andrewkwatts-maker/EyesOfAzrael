  "name": "The Divine Twins Archetype",
  "definition": "The Divine Twins represent one of the oldest and most widespread mythological patterns across Indo-European and world cultures. These paired deities embody cosmic duality - light and dark, sun and moon, life and death, mortal and immortal. Often one is associated with horses or the dawn, serving as divine helpers to humanity, rescuers at sea, and healers of the sick. The twin motif explores the unity underlying apparent opposition.",
