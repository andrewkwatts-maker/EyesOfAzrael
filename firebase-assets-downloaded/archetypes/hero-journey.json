  "displayName": "The Hero's Journey (Monomyth)",
  "definition": "The Hero's Journey, also known as the monomyth, is a universal narrative pattern identified by mythologist Joseph Campbell that describes the archetypal adventure found in myths, legends, and stories across all cultures and time periods. The hero ventures from the ordinary world into a region of supernatural wonder, encounters fabulous forces, wins a decisive victory, and returns home transformed with the power to bestow boons upon their community. This pattern reflects the psychological process of individuation and the universal human experience of growth through challenge.",

    "origins": "The hero's journey as a formal concept was articulated by Joseph Campbell in his 1949 work 'The Hero with a Thousand Faces,' though the pattern itself is as old as storytelling. Campbell drew on Carl Jung's analytical psychology, James Frazer's comparative mythology, and the narrative analysis of folklorists like Vladimir Propp. The pattern emerged from Campbell's observation that myths from vastly different cultures shared remarkably similar narrative structures - suggesting a universal human experience encoded in story form. Earlier scholars like Otto Rank and Lord Raglan had noted similar patterns in hero myths.",
    "attributes": "The hero's journey comprises three major phases: Departure (the hero leaves the ordinary world), Initiation (the hero undergoes trials in a special world), and Return (the hero brings back a boon). Within these phases, Campbell identified seventeen stages, though not every hero story contains all stages. Key attributes include: the hero as 'everyman' who represents the potential within all people; the mentor figure who provides supernatural aid; the threshold guardian who tests worthiness; the shapeshifter who creates uncertainty; the shadow who represents the hero's dark potential; and the trickster who provides comic relief and challenges assumptions.",
    "significance": "The hero's journey has become the most influential narrative template in modern storytelling, particularly in Hollywood. George Lucas explicitly used Campbell's work as a blueprint for Star Wars. The pattern has been adapted for screenwriting guides (Christopher Vogler's 'The Writer's Journey'), therapy (using myth as a framework for personal transformation), and business leadership training. Critics note the pattern's bias toward masculine, individualistic, and combat-oriented narratives, leading to feminist revisions and alternative models like 'the heroine's journey.' Despite critiques, the pattern's persistence across cultures suggests it encodes fundamental truths about human psychology and the experience of personal transformation through ordeal."
