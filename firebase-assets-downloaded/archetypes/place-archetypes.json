  "definition": "Place Archetypes represent the universal patterns of sacred, mythic, and symbolically charged locations that appear across world mythologies and religious traditions. These archetypal places - the Cosmic Mountain, the Sacred Grove, the Underworld, the Celestial City, the Primordial Waters - serve as the stage upon which mythic dramas unfold and as symbols of psychological and spiritual states. Following Mircea Eliade's concept of sacred space, these archetypal places mark locations where the divine and human realms intersect, where ordinary geography transforms into hierophany (manifestation of the sacred). The cosmic mountain connects earth to heaven; the underworld represents death, transformation, and hidden knowledge; the garden paradise recalls lost perfection; the threshold marks passages between states of being. Understanding place archetypes illuminates how human beings have always sought to orient themselves within a meaningful cosmos, creating sacred geographies that map both outer landscape and inner experience.",
