  "displayName": "Journey Archetypes - Sacred Patterns of Transformation",
  "description": "Journey Archetypes represent the fundamental narrative patterns through which heroes, gods, and seekers traverse between realms of existence, undergoing profound transformation in the process. These archetypal journeys - the descent to the underworld (katabasis), the ascent to heaven (anabasis), the quest for the sacred object, and the return home - form the structural backbone of world mythology and continue to shape storytelling across all cultures. These patterns reveal humanity's deepest understanding of spiritual transformation, death and rebirth, the acquisition of wisdom, and the hero's obligation to bring boons back to the ordinary world.",
  "definition": "Universal narrative patterns describing transformative journeys between realms or states of being, encompassing descents, ascents, quests, and returns that mark the hero's progression toward wisdom, power, or spiritual enlightenment.",
  "origins": {
    "mythologicalRoots": "Journey archetypes emerge from the earliest human myths, possibly originating in shamanic traditions where spiritual practitioners traveled to other realms in trance states. The pattern of departure, transformation, and return reflects fundamental structures of human experience.",
    "psychologicalBasis": "Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell identified journey archetypes as expressions of the individuation process - the psyche's movement toward wholeness. The journey represents the ego's encounter with the unconscious and integration of shadow elements.",
    "universalAppearance": "These patterns appear independently across cultures worldwide, suggesting they arise from deep structures of human consciousness rather than cultural diffusion."
