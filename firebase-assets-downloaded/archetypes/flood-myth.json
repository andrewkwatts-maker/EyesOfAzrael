  "name": "Flood/Deluge Myths",
  "displayName": "The Great Flood Archetype",
  "definition": "The Flood Myth represents one of the most widespread archetypal narratives in world mythology - the story of a great deluge sent by divine powers to cleanse or destroy the world, with a select few survivors preserved to begin humanity anew. This archetype appears independently in virtually every major culture: the Babylonian epic of Utnapishtim, the Hebrew account of Noah, the Greek story of Deucalion, the Hindu tale of Manu, and flood narratives from China, Mesoamerica, Australia, and countless other traditions. The flood represents divine judgment, cosmic reset, and the opportunity for renewal. As an archetype, it addresses fundamental human concerns about mortality, divine justice, the fragility of civilization, and the possibility of starting fresh. The survivor figure embodies righteousness, obedience to divine will, and the preservation of knowledge and life across catastrophic transition.",
