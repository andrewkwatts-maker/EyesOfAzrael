  "name": "The Culture Hero Archetype",
  "definition": "The Culture Hero is a mythological figure who transforms the primordial chaos into a habitable world for humanity, often through theft, trickery, or great personal sacrifice. Unlike gods who create from nothing, the culture hero typically steals essential gifts from divine powers - fire, agriculture, writing, medicine - and delivers them to mortals. This archetype represents the civilizing force that bridges the gap between divine abundance and human need.",
