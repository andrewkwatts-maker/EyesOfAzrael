  "displayName": "The Quest Journey Archetype",
  "definition": "The Quest Journey represents one of humanity's most fundamental narrative patterns - the hero's departure from the ordinary world to seek a specific objective, treasure, or truth. Unlike the broader Hero's Journey which encompasses all transformative adventures, the Quest is defined by its goal-oriented nature: there is something specific to be found, retrieved, or achieved. This archetype appears across all world cultures, from Gilgamesh's search for immortality to the Arthurian Grail quest, from Jason's pursuit of the Golden Fleece to the Buddha's quest for enlightenment. The Quest Journey provides a template for understanding life's purposeful struggles, representing the human drive toward achievement, completion, and the acquisition of what is rare and precious. The object of the quest often symbolizes spiritual truth, wholeness, or divine connection that the seeker lacks at the journey's beginning.",
