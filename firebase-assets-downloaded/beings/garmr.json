  "description": "Garmr (Old Norse: Garmr) is the fearsome blood-stained hellhound who stands eternal guard at the entrance to Helheim, the realm of the dead in Norse cosmology. Chained before the cave Gnipahellir, Garmr is described in the Eddas as the greatest of all hounds, his terrifying howls echoing across the nine worlds. His role mirrors that of Cerberus in Greek mythology - preventing the living from entering the realm of the dead and the dead from escaping. According to the Voluspa, when Ragnarok (the twilight of the gods) approaches, Garmr will break free from his chains and his howl will be one of the portents signaling the end of the current world order. During the final battle, Garmr is destined to fight the war god Tyr in a mutually fatal combat - both will slay each other, fulfilling the prophecy of their intertwined fates. Some scholars connect Garmr with Fenrir, the great wolf, though the Eddas treat them as distinct entities. Garmr embodies the threshold guardian archetype, representing the impassable boundary between life and death, order and chaos.",
