This bitter resin (Hebrew 'mor') was the primary ingredient in the Holy Anointing Oil (Exodus 30:23-25), used to consecrate priests, kings, and the Tabernacle. At the crucifixion, Jesus was offered wine mixed with myrrh as an analgesic (Mark 15:23), and Nicodemus brought 75 pounds of myrrh and aloes for His burial (John 19:39-40). From Egyptian mummification to medieval monasteries, myrrh represents the transformative mystery of death leading to resurrection.",

From Egyptian mummification to medieval wound care, from temple incense to modern antimicrobial research, myrrh remains one of humanity's most profound healing allies. Ancient Egyptian Jewish Christian Islamic Greek Chinese Botanical and Historical Overview The Commiphora Trees Myrrh is the aromatic gum resin obtained from several species of small, thorny trees in the genus Commiphora , native to Northeast Africa (Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea) and the Arabian Peninsula (Yemen, Oman). These hardy trees survive in arid, rocky terrain, producing their precious resin when the bark is wounded - either naturally or through deliberate tapping.
