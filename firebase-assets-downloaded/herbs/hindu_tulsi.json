Through divine intervention (disguised as her husband), Vrinda's chastity was broken. Devastated upon discovering the deception, Vrinda cursed Vishnu to become a stone (Shaligram). Vishnu blessed her to become the sacred Tulsi plant, forever dear to him. The Shaligram stone and Tulsi are thus inseparably worshipped together.
