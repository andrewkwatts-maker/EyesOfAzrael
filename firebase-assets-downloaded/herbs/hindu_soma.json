The identity of the original soma plant remains one of history's greatest ethnobotanical mysteries. Whether it was a psychedelic mushroom, an entheogenic plant, or a fermented brew, soma represents the archetypal sacred intoxicant - the divine substance that dissolves the boundary between mortal and immortal realms. Vedic Hindu Zoroastrian (Haoma) Indo-Iranian The Great Mystery What was the original soma plant? This question has captivated scholars, ethnobotanists, and spiritual seekers for over a century. The identity of soma was lost when the Indo-Aryan peoples migrated from Central Asia to the Indian subcontinent, leaving their original soma-producing plant behind. The Vedic texts describe soma's effects - ecstasy, visions, feeling like a god - but not the plant itself clearly enough for definitive identification. Today, various substitutes are used in Vedic rituals, but the original substance remains unknown. The Sacred Drink of the Vedas What is Soma? In Vedic religion, soma exists on multiple levels simultaneously: A Plant: A specific plant pressed to yield a sacred juice A Drink: The pressed juice, possibly mixed with milk and honey A God: Soma is a deity in his own right (Soma Deva) The Moon: In later Hinduism, Soma becomes identified with the moon A State: The ecstatic, transcendent consciousness achieved through its use Immortality: Amrita - the nectar that grants immortality to the gods Rigvedic Importance The Rigveda, the oldest Hindu scripture (c. 1500-1200 BCE), contains an entire book (Mandala 9) of 114 hymns dedicated solely to soma. Only Indra and Agni receive more hymns, demonstrating soma's central importance to Vedic religion. The Rigveda describes soma as: \"We have drunk the Soma; we have become immortal; we have gone to the light; we have found the gods. What can hostility do to us now, and what the malice of mortals, O immortal Soma?\" - Rigveda 8.48.3 Etymology Sanskrit Root: \"Su\" - to press, extract juice Meaning: \"That which is pressed\" or \"the pressed one\" Related Terms: Haoma (Avestan/Zoroastrian cognate), Hom (Persian) Characteristics Described in the Vedas Physical Properties (per Vedic texts) Color: Described variously as golden, tawny, ruddy, or brown Habitat: Grew in mountains (referenced as coming from \"the mountains\") Structure: Had stalks or stems that were pressed Processing: Crushed between stones, mixed with water, strained through sheep's wool Taste: Apparently somewhat bitter or astringent, mixed with milk and honey Effects: Produced ecstasy, visions, feeling of immortality and divine power Soma in Vedic Religious Practice The Soma Sacrifice (Soma Yajna) The soma ritual was one of the most important ceremonies in Vedic religion, performed by Brahmin priests over the course of several days.
