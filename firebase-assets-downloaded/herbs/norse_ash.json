  "description": "The Ash Tree (Fraxinus excelsior) stands at the center of Norse cosmology as Yggdrasil, the World Tree connecting the nine realms. According to the Eddas, Odin hung himself on this tree for nine nights to gain the runes, and the first humans (Ask and Embla) were created from ash and elm. Christian missionaries to Scandinavia encountered profound tree veneration, and some scholars see parallels between Odin's self-sacrifice on the tree and Christ's crucifixion. Medieval Christian chroniclers documented the Yggdrasil tradition while interpreting it through biblical lens. Ash wood was valued in monastic crafts for its strength and flexibility, used in tool handles, ecclesiastical furniture, and even church construction in Northern Europe.",
