  "description": "The Mahabodhi Temple (Sanskrit: Mahabodhi Mahavihara, 'Great Awakening Temple') marks the most sacred site in Buddhism - the exact location where Prince Siddhartha Gautama attained supreme enlightenment beneath the Bodhi Tree approximately 2,500 years ago and became the Buddha, the Awakened One. The temple complex in Bodh Gaya, Bihar, India, centers on the descendant of the original Ficus religiosa tree and a spectacular 55-meter tall pyramidal temple structure dating from the 5th-6th century CE during the Gupta period. This architectural masterpiece, with its distinctive shikhara tower, established the prototype for Buddhist temple architecture throughout Asia, influencing designs from Myanmar to Indonesia. The complex includes the Diamond Throne (Vajrasana), marking the precise spot of enlightenment, the Animeshlocha Stupa where Buddha stood gazing at the Bodhi Tree in gratitude, and the Jewel Walk (Chankramanar) where he paced in meditation. Emperor Ashoka erected the first temple here in the 3rd century BCE, and pilgrims from around the world have continuously visited for over two millennia. Today it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the most important of the four main Buddhist pilgrimage destinations.",
