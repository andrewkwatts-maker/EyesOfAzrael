Built over 2,000 years from the Middle Kingdom through the Ptolemaic period (c. 2055 BCE - 100 CE),\n                Karnak served as the principal cult center of Amun-Ra, king of the gods. Each pharaoh sought to outdo predecessors by adding\n                monuments, creating a vast accumulation of pylons, courtyards, halls, and sanctuaries that document the evolution of Egyptian\n                architecture and theology across millennia.",
