  "longDescription": "County Mayo, Ireland Croagh Patrick (Irish: Cruach Phadraig, \"Patrick's Stack\") is Ireland's holiest mountain, a 764-meter\n                (2,507-foot) peak overlooking Clew Bay in County Mayo. For over 5,000 years, this conical quartzite\n                mountain has been a place of pilgrimage - first for pre-Christian Celtic peoples who honored the\n                harvest god Crom Dubh, and then for Christians following in the footsteps of St. Patrick. According\n                to tradition, in 441 CE, Patrick fasted on the summit for forty days and forty nights, emulating\n                Moses and Christ, and it was here that he banished all snakes from Ireland. Today, over 100,000\n                pilgrims climb \"the Reek\" annually, many barefoot, making it one of the most important Christian\n                pilgrimage sites in Europe.",
