Asgard is the mightiest of the Nine Realms, home to the Aesir gods and their magnificent halls. Each major god has their own hall - Odin's Valhalla, Thor's Bilskirnir, Freyja's Folkvangr, and many others. The realm is surrounded by a great wall built by a giant (with Loki's interference preventing its completion).",
