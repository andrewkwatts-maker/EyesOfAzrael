  "longDescription": "Epirus, Northwestern Greece Dodona stands as Greece's oldest oracle, predating even the famous Oracle at Delphi by centuries.\n                Nestled in the remote mountains of Epirus in northwestern Greece, this sacred grove centered on a\n                great oak tree through which Zeus himself was believed to speak. Unlike other Greek oracles that\n                relied on elaborate rituals and priestesses in trance states, Dodona's prophecies came through the\n                rustling of oak leaves, the cooing of doves nesting in the branches, and the clanging of bronze\n                cauldrons suspended from the tree's limbs.",
