This massive sandstone\n                monolith rises 348 meters (1,142 feet) above the surrounding plain in the red heart of Australia,\n                with a circumference of 9.4 kilometers (5.8 miles) - most of the rock lies beneath the surface.\n                For the Anangu people, the traditional owners of this land for over 30,000 years, Uluru is not\n                merely a geological formation but a living cultural landscape created during Tjukurpa (the Dreamtime)\n                by ancestral beings whose actions shaped the world and continue to influence it today.",
