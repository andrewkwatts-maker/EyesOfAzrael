Dedicated to Diana Nemorensis - Diana of the Wood - this grove housed a ritual\n                that fascinated and disturbed the ancient Romans themselves: the priesthood of the Rex Nemorensis,\n                the King of the Wood, who gained his office only by killing his predecessor in single combat,\n                and who then stood guard over a sacred tree, sword in hand, awaiting the challenger who would\n                eventually kill him in turn. This strange and archaic custom survived into the Roman Imperial\n                period, a relic of beliefs far older than Rome itself.",
