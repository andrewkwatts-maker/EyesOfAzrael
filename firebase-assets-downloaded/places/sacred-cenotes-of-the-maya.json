  "longDescription": "Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico The cenotes (from Maya \"dzonot\") of the Yucatan Peninsula are natural sinkholes formed when limestone\n                bedrock collapses, revealing underground pools connected to vast subterranean river systems. For the\n                ancient Maya, these crystal-clear pools were far more than water sources - they were sacred portals\n                to Xibalba, the watery underworld realm of the dead, and the dwelling places of Chaak, the rain god.\n                The Maya believed cenotes were the mouths of the earth through which they could communicate with\n                the gods, and many became sites of pilgrimage, ritual, and human sacrifice. The most famous, the\n                Sacred Cenote at Chichen Itza, yielded hundreds of artifacts and human remains when dredged,\n                testifying to centuries of offerings to the lords of the underworld.",
