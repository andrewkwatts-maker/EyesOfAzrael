Revered as the traditional site of Jesus Christ's\n                Transfiguration - where he appeared in divine glory before Peter, James, and John, conversing\n                with Moses and Elijah - Mount Tabor has been a place of Christian pilgrimage since at least\n                the 4th century CE. Its isolated position, rising dramatically from the surrounding plain,\n                has made it a natural sacred site since ancient times, mentioned in the Hebrew Bible in\n                connection with the prophetess Deborah and the boundary of tribal territories.",
