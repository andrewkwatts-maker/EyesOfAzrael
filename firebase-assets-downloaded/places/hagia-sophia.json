Built in Constantinople (modern Istanbul) by Byzantine Emperor Justinian I between 532-537 CE,\n                it was the world's largest cathedral for nearly a thousand years and remains the finest example of\n                Byzantine architecture. Its massive dome, seeming to float on a ring of light, inspired awe for\n                centuries and influenced the development of both Christian and Islamic architecture.",
