    "description": "The Duat (Egyptian: dwAt) is the realm of the dead in ancient Egyptian religion - a vast, mysterious underworld through which the sun god Ra travels each night and where deceased souls journey to reach the afterlife. Unlike simple conceptions of an underworld, the Duat was an elaborate cosmic geography featuring rivers of fire, islands of the blessed, gates guarded by serpents, and halls where the heart was weighed against the feather of Ma'at (truth/justice). The Duat was ruled by Osiris, Lord of the Dead, with Anubis guiding souls and Ammit the Devourer consuming those who failed judgment. The Book of the Dead and Coffin Texts provided maps and spells for navigating its dangers. Each night, Ra's barque sailed through the twelve hours of the Duat, battling the chaos serpent Apophis before being reborn at dawn - a cycle mirroring the Egyptian hope for resurrection.",
