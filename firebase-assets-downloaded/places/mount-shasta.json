  "longDescription": "Siskiyou County, California, USA Mount Shasta is a towering stratovolcano rising 4,322 meters (14,179 feet) in northern California,\n                dominating the landscape as a solitary, glacier-clad peak visible for over 100 miles. For the\n                indigenous peoples of the region - including the Shasta, Wintu, Achumawi, Atsugewi, and Modoc -\n                the mountain has been sacred since time immemorial, considered the home of the Great Spirit and\n                the place where the Creator made the first people. In modern times, Mount Shasta has become a\n                global center for New Age spirituality, attracting seekers who believe it is a powerful energy\n                vortex, a UFO landing site, and the home of Lemurian survivors living in an underground city\n                called Telos. Few mountains in the world attract such diverse and intense spiritual attention.",
