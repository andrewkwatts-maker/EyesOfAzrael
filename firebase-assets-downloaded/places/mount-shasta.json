  "description": "Mount Shasta is a majestic stratovolcano rising 4,322 meters (14,179 feet) in northern California, holding profound spiritual significance for both indigenous peoples and modern spiritual seekers. For the Shasta, Wintu, Achumawi, Atsugewi, and Modoc nations, this glacier-clad peak has been sacred since time immemorial - revered as the dwelling place of the Great Spirit and the location where the Creator first made human beings. Traditional ceremonies, vision quests, and healing rituals have been conducted on its slopes for thousands of years. In the late 19th and 20th centuries, Mount Shasta became a focal point for esoteric and New Age spirituality. Theosophist Frederick Spencer Oliver claimed in his 1894 book 'A Dweller on Two Planets' that survivors of the lost continent of Lemuria live within the mountain in an underground city called Telos. The mountain is now considered one of Earth's primary spiritual energy vortexes, attracting believers who report UFO sightings, encounters with ascended masters like Saint Germain, and experiences of interdimensional travel. Its perpetually snow-capped peak, visible for over 100 miles, stands as a beacon for those seeking mystical transformation, making it one of the most spiritually diverse sacred mountains in the world.",
