For devout Hindus, Varanasi represents the axis mundi—the cosmic center where heaven meets\n                earth, where the sacred breaks through into the mundane world. The city is believed to rest\n                on the trident of Lord Shiva, one of Hinduism's principal deities, and to exist outside the\n                cycle of creation and destruction that governs the rest of the universe.
