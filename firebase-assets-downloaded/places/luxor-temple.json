Unlike most Egyptian\n                temples dedicated to a cult god or a pharaoh's funerary cult, Luxor Temple was dedicated to the\n                rejuvenation of kingship - it was here that many pharaohs were crowned and where the annual Opet\n                Festival celebrated the divine union that renewed the pharaoh's power. Located on the east bank of\n                the Nile in the heart of modern Luxor, the temple was largely built by Amenhotep III (1390-1352 BCE)\n                during the 18th Dynasty, with significant additions by Ramesses II.",
