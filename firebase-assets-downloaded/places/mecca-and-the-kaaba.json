Located in the Hejaz region of western\n                Saudi Arabia, approximately 70 kilometers inland from the Red Sea port of Jeddah, Mecca has\n                served as a pilgrimage center for over 1,400 years. At the heart of Mecca lies the Masjid al-Haram (the Sacred Mosque), within which stands the\n                Kaaba, a cubic structure draped in black silk that serves as the qibla—the direction Muslims\n                face during their five daily prayers. The Kaaba's spiritual significance transcends its\n                physical form; it represents the unity of the Muslim ummah (community) and the connection\n                between the earthly and the divine.",
