  "longDescription": "Mecca (Makkah al-Mukarramah, \"Mecca the Honored\") stands as the most sacred city in Islam,\n                birthplace of the Prophet Muhammad, and the destination of the Hajj, the annual pilgrimage\n                that constitutes one of the Five Pillars of Islam. Located in the Hejaz region of western\n                Saudi Arabia, approximately 70 kilometers inland from the Red Sea port of Jeddah, Mecca has\n                served as a pilgrimage center for over 1,400 years. At the heart of Mecca lies the Masjid al-Haram (the Sacred Mosque), within which stands the\n                Kaaba, a cubic structure draped in black silk that serves as the qibla—the direction Muslims\n                face during their five daily prayers. The Kaaba's spiritual significance transcends its\n                physical form; it represents the unity of the Muslim ummah (community) and the connection\n                between the earthly and the divine.",
