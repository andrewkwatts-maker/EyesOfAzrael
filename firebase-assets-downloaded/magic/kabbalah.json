  "title": "Jewish - Kabbalah Mystical Tradition",
  "description": "Kabbalah is the ancient Jewish mystical tradition that seeks to understand the nature of God, creation, and the soul through esoteric interpretation of sacred texts. This profound system maps divine emanation through the Tree of Life (Etz Chaim) and its ten sefirot, offering practitioners pathways for spiritual ascent, theurgic transformation, and mystical union with the Divine.",
  "overview": "Kabbalah, meaning 'receiving' or 'tradition' in Hebrew, represents one of the world's most sophisticated mystical systems. Emerging from Jewish textual interpretation and meditation practices, it developed into a comprehensive cosmological framework explaining how the infinite, unknowable God (Ein Sof) created and sustains the finite universe through successive emanations. The tradition divides into two major branches: Theoretical Kabbalah (Kabbalah Iyyunit), focused on contemplating divine mysteries and the structure of creation, and Practical Kabbalah (Kabbalah Ma'asit), concerned with using divine names, letter combinations, and ritual techniques to effect change in the spiritual and material worlds. Central to Kabbalistic thought is the Otz Chiim (Tree of Life), a diagram mapping the ten sefirot (divine attributes or emanations) and the 22 paths connecting them, corresponding to the Hebrew alphabet. This framework describes not only the structure of divinity but also the human soul, providing a mirror through which practitioners can understand themselves as microcosms of the divine macrocosm. Kabbalah profoundly influenced Western esotericism, giving rise to Hermetic Qabalah, informing ceremonial magic traditions, and shaping modern Tarot interpretation.",
