  "mythology": "african-diaspora",
  "description": "Vodou is a syncretic religion and magical tradition that emerged in Haiti from the fusion of West African Vodun practices with elements of French Catholicism during the colonial slave trade. Far from Hollywood stereotypes of zombies and curses, authentic Vodou is a sophisticated spiritual system centered on serving the lwa (spirits), maintaining cosmic balance, and honoring ancestors.",
  "overview": "Vodou (also spelled Voodoo, Vodoun, or Vodu) represents one of the most powerful examples of cultural resilience in human history. Enslaved Africans, primarily from the Fon and Ewe peoples of present-day Benin and Togo, along with Yoruba people from Nigeria, carried their spiritual practices across the Atlantic during the transatlantic slave trade. In the harsh conditions of colonial Haiti (then Saint-Domingue), these traditions merged with Catholic imagery and indigenous Taino beliefs to create a unique and powerful spiritual system. Vodou practitioners believe in a supreme creator God called Bondye (from French 'Bon Dieu'), who is considered too distant for direct worship. Instead, practitioners serve the lwa (also spelled loa), a pantheon of spirits who act as intermediaries between humans and the divine. These lwa are organized into nations (nanchon) reflecting their African origins, including the Rada (from Dahomey), Petwo (Creole spirits born in Haiti), and Gede (spirits of the dead). Central to Vodou practice is the concept of balance between the visible and invisible worlds, the living and the dead, and the individual and community.",
