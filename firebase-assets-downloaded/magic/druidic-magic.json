  "description": "Druidic magic encompasses the sacred mystical practices of the Celtic priesthood, rooted in deep reverence for nature, the cycles of the seasons, and the hidden wisdom encoded in the Ogham alphabet. This ancient system of knowledge united spiritual insight, natural philosophy, and magical practice into a comprehensive worldview that shaped Celtic civilization for over a millennium.",
  "overview": "The Druids served as the priestly class of Iron Age Celtic society, wielding profound influence as seers, judges, healers, and keepers of sacred lore. Their magical practices emerged from an intimate understanding of the natural world, particularly the sacred groves of oak trees where they conducted their most important rituals. Druidic magic operated on the principle that all of nature was alive with spiritual force, and that trained practitioners could perceive and channel this power through ritual, incantation, and the manipulation of sacred symbols. The word 'Druid' itself likely derives from the Proto-Celtic 'dru-wid,' meaning 'oak-knower' or 'one who sees the oak,' reflecting the central importance of trees in their cosmology. Their knowledge was transmitted orally through rigorous training that could last up to twenty years, preserving mysteries that the Druids believed too sacred to commit to writing.",

      "date": "May 1",

Druidic themes pervade fantasy literature, Celtic music, and contemporary Paganism. The annual gathering at Stonehenge for summer solstice draws thousands of modern Druids.",
