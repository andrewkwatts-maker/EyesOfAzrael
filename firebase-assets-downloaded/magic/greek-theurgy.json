  "mythology": "greek",
  "description": "Theurgy and Goetia represent the two primary streams of Greek ceremonial magic, distinguished by their approach to the divine and spiritual realms. Theurgy ('divine work') sought union with the gods through sacred rituals and philosophical contemplation, while Goetia ('sorcery' or 'howling') involved the evocation and command of spirits and daimones. Together, they formed the foundation of Western ceremonial magic traditions.",
  "overview": "Greek magical traditions evolved from ancient folk practices into sophisticated philosophical systems during the Classical and Late Antiquity periods. Theurgy, developed primarily by Neoplatonic philosophers such as Iamblichus of Chalcis (c. 245-325 CE) and Proclus, represented an elevated form of ritual magic aimed at achieving henosis (divine union) with the One and the celestial hierarchy. Drawing heavily from the Chaldean Oracles, a second-century collection of hexameter verses attributed to divine revelation, theurgists employed sacred names (voces magicae), symbolic objects (synthemata), and elaborate rituals to ascend through the cosmic spheres toward the Divine. In contrast, Goetia derived from earlier Greek magical practices focused on practical results: binding spells, love magic, curses, and the summoning of chthonic spirits. The Greek Magical Papyri (PGM), a collection of Greco-Egyptian magical texts from the 2nd century BCE to 5th century CE, preserves extensive goetic practices including invocations to underworld deities, spirit conjurations, and transformative rites. While later Christian and medieval sources would demonize goetia as 'black magic,' the original Greek conception understood it as working with the lower cosmic powers rather than opposing divine will. The synthesis of these traditions through Neoplatonism profoundly influenced Renaissance magic, the Western esoteric tradition, and modern ceremonial magic practices.",
