  "description": "The abduction of Persephone by Hades explains the origin of the seasons. Persephone, daughter of Demeter (goddess of harvest), is gathering flowers when the earth opens and Hades, god of the underworld, seizes her to be his queen. Demeter's grief causes all crops to wither. Zeus intervenes, but because Persephone ate pomegranate seeds in the underworld, she must spend part of each year below (winter) and part above (spring/summer).",
