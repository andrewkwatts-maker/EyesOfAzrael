  "description": "The myth of Amaterasu hiding in the Heavenly Rock Cave is one of the most celebrated stories in Japanese mythology, recorded in the Kojiki (712 CE) and Nihon Shoki (720 CE). When Amaterasu, the sun goddess, sealed herself in a cave to escape her brother Susanoo's violent rampage, the world plunged into eternal darkness. The myth explains the origins of sacred Shinto rituals, especially kagura dance, and illustrates how cleverness, cooperation, and sacred celebration can overcome even cosmic calamity.",
