  "description": "The Pentagram is one of the most powerful and widely recognized symbols in Western esoteric tradition. This five-pointed star, drawn with a single continuous line, represents the microcosm of humanity and the macrocosm of the universe. Its proportions embody the golden ratio, making it a supreme symbol of sacred geometry and divine harmony. Throughout history, it has served as a protective talisman, a symbol of the five elements, and a key to understanding the relationship between humanity and the cosmos.",
  "meaning": "The five-pointed star representing the five elements (Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Spirit), the microcosm of humanity, sacred geometry through the golden ratio, and the balance of elemental forces in Western esoteric tradition.",
  "visualDescription": "A five-pointed star formed by drawing five straight lines that create a continuous, interlocking pattern. The figure can be inscribed within a circle (pentacle) and features the golden ratio in the proportions between its lines. When drawn with one point upward, it represents spirit presiding over matter; inverted, it symbolizes matter dominating spirit.",
