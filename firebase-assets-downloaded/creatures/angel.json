  "description": "Angels (from Greek 'angelos,' Hebrew 'malakh,' meaning 'messenger') are spiritual beings created by God to serve as His messengers, warriors, and ministers. In Christian theology, angels are incorporeal beings of pure intellect and will, organized in hierarchical orders. They appear throughout Scripture from Genesis to Revelation, guarding Eden, announcing Christ's birth, ministering to Jesus in Gethsemane, and proclaiming the Resurrection. The Church teaches that every person has a guardian angel assigned to guide and protect them. Angels worship God eternally, execute divine judgments, and serve as intermediaries between heaven and earth.",

  "content": "# Angels\n\n## Nature and Origin\n\nAngels are spiritual beings created by God before the material world (Job 38:4-7). As pure spirits without bodies, they possess intellect and free will superior to humans. Their primary purpose is to glorify God and execute His will in creation.\n\n## Biblical Appearances\n\n### Old Testament\n- **Garden of Eden**: Cherubim guard the way to the Tree of Life (Genesis 3:24)\n- **Abraham's Visitors**: Three angels announce Isaac's birth (Genesis 18)\n- **Jacob's Ladder**: Angels ascending and descending between heaven and earth (Genesis 28:12)\n- **Burning Bush**: The Angel of the Lord appears to Moses (Exodus 3:2)\n- **Balaam's Donkey**: Angel blocks the way (Numbers 22:22-35)\n- **Isaiah's Vision**: Seraphim in the throne room (Isaiah 6)\n- **Daniel's Lions**: Angel shuts the lions' mouths (Daniel 6:22)\n\n### New Testament\n- **Annunciation**: Gabriel announces Christ's conception (Luke 1:26-38)\n- **Nativity**: Angels proclaim Christ's birth to shepherds (Luke 2:8-14)\n- **Temptation**: Angels minister to Jesus after Satan's temptation (Matthew 4:11)\n- **Gethsemane**: An angel strengthens Jesus (Luke 22:43)\n- **Resurrection**: Angels announce Christ has risen (Matthew 28:2-7)\n- **Ascension**: Two angels explain Christ's return (Acts 1:10-11)\n- **Apocalypse**: Angels execute judgments throughout Revelation\n\n## Guardian Angels\n\nJesus affirms guardian angels: 'See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father' (Matthew 18:10). The Church celebrates the Feast of Guardian Angels on October 2.\n\n## Theological Significance\n\nAngels demonstrate that God's creation extends beyond the material realm. They model perfect obedience and worship. Their ministry to Christ and the Church shows God's care for His people. The fallen angels (demons) serve as a warning about the misuse of free will.\n\n",
