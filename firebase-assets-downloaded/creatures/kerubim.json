  "content": "# Cherubim (Keruvim)\n\n## Biblical Foundations\n\n### Genesis - Guardians of Eden\nAfter Adam and Eve's expulsion, God placed cherubim at the east of Eden, with a flaming sword, to guard the way to the Tree of Life (Genesis 3:24). This establishes their role as guardians of sacred thresholds.\n\n### Exodus - The Ark of the Covenant\nGod commanded Moses to make two cherubim of gold for the Mercy Seat (kapporet) of the Ark: 'The cherubim shall spread out their wings above, overshadowing the mercy seat with their wings, their faces one to another' (Exodus 25:18-20). God declared: 'There I will meet with you, and from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim' (Exodus 25:22).\n\n### The Temple of Solomon\nSolomon's Temple featured enormous cherubim in the Holy of Holies: 'In the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim of olivewood, each ten cubits high... He spread their wings so that a wing of one touched the one wall, and a wing of the other cherub touched the other wall' (1 Kings 6:23-27).\n\n### Ezekiel's Throne Vision\nEzekiel's vision (chapters 1, 10) provides the most detailed description of cherubim as the 'living creatures' (chayot) bearing God's throne-chariot (merkavah):\n- Each had four faces: human (front), lion (right), ox (left), eagle (back)\n- Each had four wings: two covering their bodies, two for flying\n- Their legs were straight with calf-like feet gleaming like bronze\n- They had human hands under their wings\n- Burning coals moved among them; lightning flashed from them\n- Beside each was a wheel within a wheel (ophanim), full of eyes\n\n## Symbolism of the Four Faces\n\n| Face | Represents | Evangelist (Christian) | Attribute |\n|------|------------|----------------------|----------|\n| Human | Humanity/Reason | Matthew | Incarnation |\n| Lion | Royalty/Courage | Mark | Resurrection |\n| Ox | Service/Sacrifice | Luke | Sacrifice |\n| Eagle | Divine Vision | John | Ascension |\n\n## Theological Significance\n\nCherubim represent the fullness of created life in service to the Creator. Their many eyes signify divine omniscience; their four faces represent cosmic sovereignty over all creation. As throne-bearers, they demonstrate that the God of Israel is not a local deity but the Lord of the universe.\n\n",
