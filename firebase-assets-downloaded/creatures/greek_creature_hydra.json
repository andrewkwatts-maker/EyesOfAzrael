  "mythology_story": "The Hydra was born to Typhon, the most terrifying monster in all Greek mythology, and Echidna, the half-woman half-serpent known as the 'Mother of All Monsters.' This made the Hydra sibling to many of mythology's most fearsome creatures: Cerberus the three-headed hound of Hades, the Chimera, the Nemean Lion, and the Sphinx. The goddess Hera, ever hostile to Heracles as the illegitimate son of her husband Zeus, raised the Hydra specifically to be his doom. She placed the creature in the swamps of Lerna, where it terrorized the surrounding countryside, destroying crops, killing livestock, and devouring anyone who ventured near its fetid lair.",

  "physicalDescription": "The Lernaean Hydra was a massive, serpentine water dragon with multiple heads - ancient sources variously describe it as having five, seven, nine, or even one hundred heads. Each head possessed a long, sinuous neck and a mouth filled with venomous fangs. The central head was golden and immortal, impervious to any mortal weapon. The creature's body was covered in scales so tough that no blade could pierce them, and its blood was so toxic that even its scent could kill. When the Hydra rose from the fetid waters of Lake Lerna, its multiple heads weaved and struck with terrible coordination, making it nearly impossible to approach.",

Its breath and blood were so poisonous that even its scent could kill.
