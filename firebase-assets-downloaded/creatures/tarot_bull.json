  "name": "The Bull",
  "displayName": "The Bull - Kerubic Guardian of Earth",
  "description": "The Bull stands as one of the Four Kerubim (Holy Living Creatures) in Tarot symbolism, appearing prominently on The World (XXI) and Wheel of Fortune (X) cards. Representing the fixed earth sign of Taurus and the element of Earth, the Bull embodies material stability, patient strength, agricultural abundance, and sacrificial service. In the Western esoteric tradition, the Bull corresponds to the Gospel of Luke and symbolizes the priestly, sacrificial nature of Christ's ministry. This ancient symbol traces its lineage from the Mesopotamian winged bulls (lamassu), through the cherubim of Ezekiel's vision, to the four living creatures of Revelation, making it one of the most enduring sacred images in human spiritual history.",
  "origins": {
    "biblicalRoots": "The Bull as a kerubic creature derives from the vision of Ezekiel (1:10) where the prophet saw four living creatures, each with four faces including that of an ox. This imagery reappears in Revelation 4:7 as one of the 'four living creatures' surrounding the throne of God.",
    "ancientNearEast": "Bull symbolism pervades ancient Mesopotamian, Egyptian, and Mediterranean religions. The Apis Bull of Egypt, the Bull of Heaven in Gilgamesh, and the Minoan bull cult all prefigure the sacred bull in later traditions.",
    "evangelistAssociation": "Early Christian tradition associated the four living creatures with the four Evangelists. The Bull/Ox became the symbol of Luke's Gospel, which emphasizes Christ's sacrificial priesthood and begins with Zechariah's Temple service."
  },
  "physicalDescription": "In Tarot imagery, the Bull appears as a winged creature with the body of a powerful ox, often depicted in one of the four corners of The World card. It is typically shown in profile with powerful musculature, sometimes with a halo or surrounded by clouds, emphasizing its celestial nature.",
