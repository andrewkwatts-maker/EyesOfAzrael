        "narrative": "In the beginning, there was only endless space and Tawa, the Sun Spirit, who existed in the void. Tawa wished to create a world, so he gathered his thoughts and created Kokyangwuti - Spider Grandmother - to be his helper and co-creator. Spider Grandmother began to weave. She wove the sacred web of creation, and as she wove, she sang the creation song. From her web came the earth, the sky, the waters, and all living things. She shaped humans from clay - four colors of clay for four peoples - and covered them with her white cape woven of creative wisdom. She sang over them, and they came to life. Then she led them through the worlds, guiding them upward through the emergence place (sipapu) when each world became corrupt, until they reached this Fourth World where we now live.",

Spider Woman found them and gave them sacred gifts: eagle feathers for protection, sacred stones, and most importantly, the knowledge of the life-giving trail to the Sun's house. She taught them the sacred words to say when challenged, which would prove their divine heritage. Without Spider Woman's guidance, the twins could not have completed their quest. Her wisdom and gifts allowed them to survive the trials set by the Sun and obtain the lightning weapons needed to make the world safe for humans.",

        "title": "The Gift of Weaving (Navajo)",
        "narrative": "Long ago, the Navajo people did not know how to weave. Spider Woman saw that they needed protection from the cold and beauty in their lives. She came to a young woman and taught her the sacred art. 'Build your loom from the sky,' Spider Woman instructed. 'The cross poles shall be made of sky and earth cords, the warp sticks of sun rays, the heddle of rock crystal and sheet lightning. The batten shall be a sun halo, the comb white shell.' She taught that each weaving should have a spirit line - a small break in the pattern - so the weaver's spirit would not be trapped in the work. She taught the sacred designs that tell stories and carry power. To this day, Navajo weavers honor Spider Woman when they work, and the art of weaving remains sacred, passed down through generations.",
        "teaching": "Creative work is sacred work. The act of making is a form of prayer, and what we create carries spiritual power."
