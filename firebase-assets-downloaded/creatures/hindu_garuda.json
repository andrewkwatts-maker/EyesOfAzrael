  "mythology_story": "Birth from the Cosmic Egg: Garuda was born to Sage Kashyapa and Vinata , one of his wives. Vinata desired children and received two eggs. Impatient after 500 years, she broke open one egg prematurely, giving birth to Aruna (charioteer of the sun god), who was incompletely formed. She waited for the second egg, from which Garuda hatched—fully formed, radiant, and powerful. The Quest for Amrita: Vinata had become enslaved to her co-wife Kadru , mother of the Nagas (serpents), through a lost wager. Kadru demanded that Garuda steal amrita (nectar of immortality) from the gods as the price of his mother's freedom. Despite the seemingly impossible task, Garuda flew to the heavens. The gods' defenses proved futile against Garuda 's might. He defeated the guardian devas, extinguished the ring of fire protecting the amrita, and navigated through deadly chakras (rotating blades). He seized the amrita and flew back, but was intercepted by Vishnu , who was impressed by Garuda 's strength and devotion to his mother. Vishnu offered Garuda a boon, and Garuda asked to be placed above Vishnu —thus becoming Vishnu 's vahana (mount), the only being to ride upon the Lord. Vishnu , in turn, granted Garuda immortality without drinking the amrita.",
