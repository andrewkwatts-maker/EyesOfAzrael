  "mythology_story": "Birth from the Cosmic Egg: Garuda was born to Sage Kashyapa and Vinata, one of his wives. Vinata desired children and received two eggs. Impatient after 500 years, she broke open one egg prematurely, giving birth to Aruna (charioteer of the sun god), who was incompletely formed. She waited for the second egg, from which Garuda hatched - fully formed, radiant, and powerful.\n\nThe Quest for Amrita: Vinata had become enslaved to her co-wife Kadru, mother of the Nagas (serpents), through a lost wager. Kadru demanded that Garuda steal amrita (nectar of immortality) from the gods as the price of his mother's freedom. Despite the seemingly impossible task, Garuda flew to the heavens. The gods' defenses proved futile against Garuda's might. He defeated the guardian devas, extinguished the ring of fire protecting the amrita, and navigated through deadly chakras (rotating blades). He seized the amrita and flew back, but was intercepted by Vishnu, who was impressed by Garuda's strength and devotion to his mother.\n\nCovenant with Vishnu: Vishnu offered Garuda a boon, and Garuda asked to be placed above Vishnu - thus becoming Vishnu's vahana (mount), the only being to ride upon the Lord. Vishnu, in turn, granted Garuda immortality without drinking the amrita. Garuda then delivered the amrita to free his mother but, through Indra's trickery, the serpents did not actually consume it.\n\nEternal Enmity with Serpents: The failed wager and his mother's enslavement created eternal enmity between Garuda and the Nagas. He devours serpents as his food, and they flee at the mere sound of his wings. This enmity symbolizes the eternal conflict between spiritual aspiration (the eagle soaring heavenward) and earthly attachment (the serpent bound to the ground).",

  "description": "Garuda, the King of Birds and divine eagle, serves as the vahana (mount) of Lord Vishnu in Hindu mythology. Born from a cosmic egg to the sage Kashyapa and his wife Vinata, Garuda emerged with blazing golden radiance and immense power that initially frightened even the gods. His epic quest to steal the amrita (nectar of immortality) to free his mother from enslavement to the serpents demonstrated his extraordinary strength, filial devotion, and cosmic significance. Rather than consuming the amrita himself, he accepted Vishnu's offer of immortality and eternal service, becoming the god's mount and companion. Garuda's eternal enmity with serpents (nagas) represents the cosmic struggle between spiritual aspiration and earthly bondage. Across South and Southeast Asia, Garuda remains one of the most powerful divine symbols, appearing in the national emblems of Indonesia and Thailand and representing the triumph of good over evil.",
