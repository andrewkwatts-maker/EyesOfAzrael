  "description": "Nine orders of angels arranged in three hierarchies (triads), each reflecting different aspects of divine glory\n        and serving distinct functions in God's cosmic plan. This systematic ordering was established by\n        Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite in his 5th-6th century treatise De Coelesti Hierarchia\n        (On the Celestial Hierarchy), drawing from biblical sources and theological contemplation.",
