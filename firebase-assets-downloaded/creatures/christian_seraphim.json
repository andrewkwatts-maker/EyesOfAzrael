  "symbolism": "In Christian art, seraphim are typically depicted as figures with six wings, often red or golden in color to represent divine fire. They may be shown entirely covered by wings, with only a face visible, or in human form surrounded by flames. In iconography, seraphim appear around the throne of Christ, especially in depictions of the Last Judgment or the Heavenly Liturgy. Their color is traditionally red, symbolizing divine love and sacrificial fire. The six wings represent: two covering the face (reverence before God), two covering the feet (humility), and two for flying (ready service).",
