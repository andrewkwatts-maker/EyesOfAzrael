        "christianVsZoroastrian": "Unlike Zoroastrian dualism where Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu are co-eternal principles, Christianity teaches that Satan and demons are created beings who fell from grace, always subject to divine sovereignty.",

      },
      "typologicalReading": "The Zoroastrian hope for Frashokereti (the final restoration) when all daevas will be destroyed parallels Christian eschatology, though Christians proclaim this victory already inaugurated in Christ's resurrection.",
