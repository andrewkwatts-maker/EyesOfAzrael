        "title": "The Coming of White Buffalo Calf Woman",
        "narrative": "Long ago, when the Lakota were experiencing a time of famine and hardship, two young scouts were sent out to search for buffalo. As they stood on a hill scanning the horizon, they saw something approaching - a beautiful woman dressed in white buckskin, walking toward them across the prairie. As she came closer, they saw that she was more beautiful than any woman they had ever seen. One of the scouts had impure thoughts and reached out to touch her. Instantly, a cloud of mist surrounded him, and when it cleared, only his skeleton remained - he had been destroyed by his own disrespect. The other scout, who had approached with a humble and pure heart, was told: 'Go to your people and tell them to prepare a great lodge. I am coming to bring them something holy.'"

        "title": "The Gift of the Sacred Pipe",
        "narrative": "The scout returned and told the people what he had seen. They prepared a great lodge, and soon the mysterious woman appeared. She carried a bundle on her back, and as she entered the lodge, the people felt a sense of overwhelming peace and reverence. She opened her bundle and revealed the Sacred Pipe - the Chanunpa. The bowl, she explained, represented the earth and all female beings. The stem represented all that grows upon the earth and all male beings. When joined together and filled with sacred tobacco, the pipe became a living prayer that connected the people to Wakan Tanka (the Great Mystery) and to all of creation. 'With this pipe,' she said, 'you will send your voices to Wakan Tanka, your Grandfather and Father, and to Grandmother and Mother Earth. All things are connected. When you pray with this pipe, you pray with and for everything.'"

      "theDeparture": {
        "title": "Her Departure and Promise",
        "narrative": "After teaching the people the sacred ways, White Buffalo Calf Woman prepared to leave. She told them that she would look back on them in every age, and that she would return at the end of an age. As she walked away from the lodge, she stopped and rolled upon the earth. When she rose, she had transformed into a black buffalo. She walked further, rolled again, and became a brown buffalo. Rolling a third time, she became a red buffalo. Finally, on her fourth roll, she became a white buffalo calf - the most sacred of all animals - and disappeared over the hill. The Sacred Pipe she left behind has been kept by the Lakota ever since, currently in the care of the Arvol Looking Horse family at Green Grass, South Dakota. It is among the most sacred objects in Native American spirituality."
