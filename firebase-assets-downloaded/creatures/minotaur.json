      "typologicalReading": "The Minotaur narrative provides a rich prefiguration of the Harrowing of Hell: Christ (greater than Theseus) descends into the labyrinth of death, defeats the monster of sin/Satan, and leads captives to freedom, never losing connection to divine life (the thread of his divine nature).",
      "symbolismOfLabyrinth": "The labyrinth has been variously interpreted as: the grave/Hades (which Christ entered), the complexity of sin (which ensnares humanity), the pilgrimage of life (walked in cathedral floors), or the womb of rebirth (emerging renewed).",
