They may be shown entirely covered by wings, with only a face visible, or in human form surrounded by flames. In iconography, seraphim appear around the throne of Christ , especially in depictions of the Last Judgment or the Heavenly Liturgy. Their color is traditionally red, symbolizing divine love and sacrificial fire.",
