  "mythology_story": "Unlike humans created from clay and angels created from light, jinn were created from \"marij min nar\" - a smokeless flame of fire. This fiery origin grants them unique properties: they can move at tremendous speeds, change forms, and exist in dimensions beyond normal human perception. Their creation predates humanity, as mentioned in the Quran: \"And the jinn We created before from scorching fire\" (15:27). The Jinn are a class of sentient beings existing in a dimension parallel to humans. Like humans, they possess free will, face moral choices, and will be judged on the Day of Resurrection. Among them are believers, disbelievers, righteous, and wicked. Prophet Sulayman (Solomon) was granted unique authority over jinn, wind, and animals as a miracle from Allah. Jinn worked on his construction projects, created art, and served in his kingdom.",
