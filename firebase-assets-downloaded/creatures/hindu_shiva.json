  "description": "Garuda, the divine king of birds, stands as one of Hindu mythology's most magnificent and powerful creatures. Born from an egg laid by Vinata after a thousand years of incubation, Garuda emerged blazing with radiance equal to the cosmic fire that ends worlds, causing even the gods to shield their eyes. This enormous eagle-like being possesses a human torso, golden wings spanning vast distances, and plumage of every color. His enmity with serpents (nagas) is legendary - he once journeyed to Indra's heaven to steal the amrita (nectar of immortality) to free his mother from servitude, demonstrating strength enough to defeat all the gods combined. As the vahana (divine mount) of Lord Vishnu, Garuda carries the Preserver across the three worlds, symbolizing the soul's aspiration toward the divine. His image adorns temples throughout South and Southeast Asia, and he serves as the national emblem of Indonesia and Thailand, testament to his enduring cultural significance.",

  "sections": {
    "origins": "Garuda was born from Vinata, one of the wives of the sage Kashyapa, who also fathered the nagas through his other wife Kadru. Vinata and Kadru wagered on the color of the divine horse Uchchaihshravas, with the loser becoming the other's servant. Kadru cheated by having her naga sons blacken the horse's tail, enslaving Vinata. When Garuda hatched after a thousand years, his brilliance terrified the gods. He immediately set out to free his mother by fetching amrita from heaven, defeating Indra and all the gods to do so.",
    "attributes": "Garuda embodies the highest virtues of devotion (bhakti), strength (bala), and speed (vega). His name derives from the root 'gri' (to speak), as he is considered a vehicle of sacred speech. He represents the Vedas, with his wings as the rhythms of sacred chant. His war against serpents symbolizes the eternal struggle between spiritual aspiration (represented by his flight) and earthly entanglement (represented by crawling serpents).",
    "significance": "As Vishnu's vahana, Garuda represents the soul's aspiration toward the divine and the power of devotion to overcome all obstacles. His image protects against serpent bites and poison. The Garuda Purana, attributed to him, is a major text on death rites and afterlife. In temple architecture, Garuda pillars (garuda-stambha) stand before Vishnu shrines. His theological importance extends beyond Hinduism into Buddhism and Jainism, where he appears as a protector figure.",
    "impact": "Garuda's influence spans South and Southeast Asian cultures. He is the national emblem of Indonesia (Garuda Pancasila) and Thailand (Garuda as royal symbol). In Balinese Hinduism, the Garuda-vs-Naga dynamic remains central to ritual and art. His image appears in countless temples, coins, royal seals, and national airlines. The concept of the divine mount carrying gods influenced Central Asian and later European medieval imagery of the griffin."
