      "content": "Pegasus sprang forth from the severed neck of the Gorgon Medusa when the hero Perseus decapitated her with his divine gifts. Medusa had been violated by Poseidon in Athena's temple, and from the union of sea god and monster, Pegasus was born - his very name possibly deriving from 'pegai' (springs), connecting him to the waters of his father's domain. His brother Chrysaor, a golden giant or warrior, emerged alongside him. The immortal winged horse immediately flew to Mount Olympus, where Zeus welcomed him and set him to carry divine thunderbolts. His miraculous birth from death and horror became a symbol of beauty and inspiration emerging from darkness."

    "mythology": {
      "title": "Mythology",
      "content": "Pegasus's most famous myth involves the hero Bellerophon. When the young prince was tasked with slaying the Chimera, he sought Pegasus, whom he found drinking at the spring Peirene in Corinth. With a golden bridle given by Athena (or Poseidon in some versions), Bellerophon tamed the divine horse. Together they defeated the Chimera, the Amazons, and the Solymi warriors. But Bellerophon's pride grew, and he attempted to fly to Olympus itself. Zeus sent a gadfly to sting Pegasus, who bucked and threw his rider. Bellerophon fell to earth, surviving but broken and cursed to wander alone. Pegasus continued to Olympus, where he became the bearer of Zeus's thunderbolts and was eventually placed among the stars as a constellation."

      "content": "Pegasus is depicted as a magnificent white horse with great feathered wings, capable of unlimited flight. His divine nature makes him immortal and far swifter than any earthly creature. Where his hooves strike the ground, springs burst forth - most famously Hippocrene ('Horse Spring') on Mount Helicon, sacred to the Muses and source of poetic inspiration. He represents the union of earth (horse), sea (Poseidon's offspring), and sky (winged flight). Unlike mortal horses, Pegasus possesses intelligence and moral judgment, choosing only worthy riders. His connection to the Muses made him a symbol of artistic inspiration, while his role carrying thunderbolts associated him with divine power and cosmic order."

      "title": "Cultural Role",
      "content": "Pegasus became one of the most enduring symbols from Greek mythology. Ancient Corinthians featured him on their coins, claiming him as their city's divine protector. The Hippocrene spring made him patron of poets and musicians throughout antiquity. In Renaissance art, he represented poetic inspiration and the soul's ascent toward heaven. The myth of Bellerophon's fall served as a warning against hubris - the presumption of mortals to equal the gods. Pegasus's image adorns the logo of numerous companies, military units, and institutions, symbolizing speed, freedom, and inspiration. The constellation Pegasus remains one of the largest in the northern sky, his form traced in stars as it has been for millennia."

  "description": "Pegasus is the immortal winged horse of Greek mythology, born from the blood of the Gorgon Medusa when Perseus decapitated her. Child of Poseidon and the monster, Pegasus embodies the paradox of beauty born from horror. His snowy-white form and great feathered wings allowed him to soar to the heights of Olympus, where Zeus welcomed him as the bearer of divine thunderbolts. The hero Bellerophon tamed Pegasus with a golden bridle and together they slew the Chimera, but when Bellerophon attempted to fly to Olympus, Zeus cast him down while Pegasus ascended to become a constellation. Where Pegasus's hooves struck Mount Helicon, the spring Hippocrene burst forth, becoming sacred to the Muses and a source of poetic inspiration. Pegasus represents the transcendent power of artistic inspiration, the soul's aspiration toward the divine, and the lesson that such gifts are given, not seized.",
