## Research and Implementation Notes

### For Database Integration

Each deity entry enhanced with:
- 5-10 cuneiform source references
- 2-4 primary temple descriptions
- 2-3 astral associations
- 2-5 city patronage records
- Complete period-by-period historical development
- Cultural name evolution (Sumerian → Akkadian → Babylonian)
- Cross-cultural parallels where applicable

### For User Experience

Enhanced data enables:
- **Timeline Visualizations:** Show deity importance over time
- **City Search:** Find deities worshipped in specific city
- **Period Filter:** Show all deities prominent in specific era
- **Source Lookup:** Find deities mentioned in specific cuneiform text
- **Comparative Study:** See parallels across cultures
- **Historical Context:** Understand mythology within historical framework

### Accuracy and Scholarship

All information sourced from:
- Academic assyriology consensus
- Archaeological excavation reports
- Cuneiform text translations
- Temple inscription analysis
- Comparative religious studies
- Scholarly historical periodization

### Limitations

- Pre-2000 BCE chronology: ±100 year margin of error
- Some myths exist only in fragments or late versions
- Temple locations uncertain for some deities
- Theological interpretations vary among scholars
- Ancient texts created for political/religious purposes (not neutral history)
