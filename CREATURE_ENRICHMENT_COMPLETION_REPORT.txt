TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

Issue: "Creatures directory not found"
Solution: Run scripts from project root directory
  $ cd /path/to/EyesOfAzrael
  $ node scripts/enrich-creatures-metadata.js

Issue: "Service account file not found"
Solution: Verify Firebase credentials file exists
  $ ls eyesofazrael-firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc-*.json

Issue: "Some creatures not enriched"
Solution: Check CREATURES_ENRICHMENT_REPORT.json for details
  $ cat CREATURES_ENRICHMENT_REPORT.json | jq '.statistics'

Issue: Firebase upload timeout
Solution: Use smaller batch sizes
  $ node scripts/upload-creatures-enriched-to-firebase.js --batch-size=50
