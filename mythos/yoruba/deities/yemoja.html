     Great Mother Orisha of the Ocean, Rivers, Fertility, and Motherhood
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
     The universal mother who gave birth to many of the Orisha, Yemoja is the great nurturer and protector. Her realm is the ocean and the Ogun River in Nigeria. She embodies the deep, mysterious, life-giving power of the waters. Yemoja fiercely protects women, especially pregnant women and mothers, and all who dwell near the sea. Her embrace is like the ocean - vast, nurturing, and capable of tremendous power when her children are threatened.

     Yeye Omo Eja - Mother Whose Children Are the Fish
    </h3>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
     Yemoja's name derives from "Yeye omo eja" - "Mother whose children are the fish." As fish are countless in the sea, so are her children countless among humanity. She represents the primordial womb from which all life emerged - the salt water of the ocean that mirrors the salt water of the womb.

     Mythology and Pataki (Sacred Stories)
    </h2>
    <p>
     Yemoja's pataki reveal her as the primordial mother, the source of life, and a fierce protector. In Nigeria, she is associated with the Ogun River; in the diaspora, she rules the ocean itself - the great waters that carried her children to new lands.
    </p>
    <div class="pataki-box">
     <h4>
      Yemoja Gives Birth to the Orisha
     </h4>
     <p>
      In one origin story, Yemoja's body swelled until it could contain no more. When she burst, the waters flooded forth to create the rivers and oceans. From her womb came many of the major Orisha - Shango, Ogun, Oshun, Oya, and others (the specific children vary by tradition). Her body became the earth, and her breasts became two hills from which flow the source of the Ogun River. This myth establishes Yemoja as the primordial mother from whom life itself flows.
     </p>
    </div>
    <div class="pataki-box">
     <h4>
      Yemoja and Orunmila - The Origin of Divination
     </h4>
     <p>
      Yemoja was once married to Orunmila, the Orisha of wisdom and divination. She was his first wife and helped him establish the Ifa system. However, Orunmila forbade her from touching his sacred divination implements. One day, curious about her husband's powers, Yemoja secretly used the ikin (palm nuts). When Orunmila discovered this, he banished her. Heartbroken, Yemoja went to live in the river, taking with her knowledge of divination. This is why women can become Iyanifa (female diviners) and why water is used in many divination rituals.
     </p>
    </div>
    <div class="pataki-box">
     <h4>
      Yemoja's Protection of Women
     </h4>
     <p>
      A young woman was being pursued by an evil spirit who wished to steal her unborn child. She ran and ran until she reached the river's edge with nowhere to go. Crying out to Yemoja, she threw herself into the water. But instead of drowning, she felt the Great Mother's arms embrace her. Yemoja carried her downstream to safety and killed the evil spirit with her waves. When the woman gave birth, Yemoja blessed the child. This is why pregnant women pray to Yemoja for protection, and why births in Yoruba tradition are often accompanied by offerings to the water.
     </p>
    </div>
    <div class="pataki-box">
     <h4>
      Yemoja and Olokun - The Depths and the Surface
     </h4>
     <p>
      Yemoja and Olokun (Orisha of the deep ocean) have a complex relationship. In some traditions, Olokun is Yemoja's mother or father; in others, they are aspects of the same force. Olokun rules the unfathomable depths - the mysteries beyond human comprehension. Yemoja rules the surface and the waters that touch the shore - the aspect of the sea that interacts with humanity. Together they represent the full power of the ocean, from sunlit waves to the abyss where no light reaches.
     </p>
    </div>
    <div class="pataki-box">
     <h4>
      The Middle Passage - Yemoja's Grief
     </h4>
     <p>
      When her children were stolen from Africa and forced onto slave ships, Yemoja wept. Her tears filled the Atlantic Ocean with her sorrow. But she did not abandon her children - she followed them across the water, protecting those she could, receiving those who died at sea into her watery embrace. In the Americas, she is honored as the spirit who accompanied the enslaved across the ocean and who continues to protect her children in the diaspora. This is why she is so powerfully venerated in Cuba, Brazil, and throughout the Caribbean.

     In Nigeria, Yemoja's primary sacred site is the
     <strong>
      Ogun River
     </strong>
     in Ogun State, where an annual festival is held. The river's source at the hills is considered especially sacred. In the diaspora, the ocean itself is her shrine - devotees make offerings at the beach, especially at sunset or during the full moon.

      Festa de Iemanja
     </strong>
     on February 2nd sees millions of people at beaches offering flowers, perfume, and mirrors to the sea. In Rio, boats carry offerings to be thrown into the ocean.
