     Orisha of Thunder, Lightning, Fire, and Divine Justice

     The mighty Orisha of thunder and lightning, Shango embodies royal power, virility, and divine justice. Once a mortal king of the Oyo Empire, he became deified after death. His thunderstones (edun ara) fall from the sky when lightning strikes, and his double-headed axe (oshe) channels the power of storms. Shango is passion, power, and righteous fury made manifest - the king who speaks with the voice of the thunder.

     Mythology and Pataki (Sacred Stories)
    </h2>
    <p>
     Shango is unique among the major Orisha in having a historical origin - he was the fourth Alaafin (king) of the Oyo Empire, who ruled with such power that he became deified after death. His myths blend historical memory with divine mythology.
    </p>
    <div class="pataki-box">
     <h4>
      Shango's Mortal Life - The Fourth Alaafin
     </h4>
     <p>
      Shango was born to Oranmiyan, founder of Oyo, and Torosi, a princess of the Nupe people. From childhood, he demonstrated extraordinary abilities - it was said that fire came from his mouth when he spoke in anger. He became the fourth Alaafin of Oyo and was renowned as a powerful warrior and skilled strategist. Shango had a notorious temper and was known for his multiple wives and his love of dance and drumming. He was a fearsome king who demanded absolute loyalty.
     </p>
    </div>
    <div class="pataki-box">
     <h4>
      Oba Koso - The King Did Not Hang
     </h4>
     <p>
      The most famous pataki explains how Shango became an Orisha. Two of Shango's generals, Gbonka and Timi, had grown too powerful and began to threaten his authority. Shango set them against each other, but his scheme backfired when Gbonka killed Timi and turned against the king himself. Facing defeat and abandonment by his people, Shango went into the forest and hanged himself from an ayan tree. However, his followers refused to accept his death. They proclaimed "Oba koso!" - "The king did not hang!" - declaring that he had not died but ascended to Orun (heaven) to become an Orisha. Thunder and lightning became his weapons, sent from the sky to punish liars, thieves, and those who offend him.
     </p>
    </div>
    <div class="pataki-box">
     <h4>
      Shango Acquires the Power of Fire
     </h4>
     <p>
      Before he mastered thunder, Shango sought the power of fire. He consulted a babalawo who prepared a powerful medicine for him. Shango was instructed not to eat it, but his curiosity overcame him. Upon swallowing the medicine, fire began to pour from his mouth - but he could not control it. He accidentally burned his own palace and several of his wives. Desperate, Shango sought help from Osanyin, who taught him to channel the fire into the sky as lightning. This is why lightning comes from the clouds when Shango speaks in anger, and why those struck by lightning are considered to have offended him.
     </p>
    </div>
    <div class="pataki-box">
     <h4>
      Shango and His Three Wives
     </h4>
     <p>
      Shango had three principal wives, each representing different aspects of feminine power:
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>
       Oya
      </strong>
      - His most beloved wife, whom he stole from his brother Ogun. Oya matched Shango's ferocity and rode into battle alongside him. She controls the wind that precedes his storms.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>
       Oshun
      </strong>
      - His favorite wife when he desired sweetness and pleasure. Oshun seduced Shango with her beauty and honey. She cools his fire with her river waters.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>
       Oba
      </strong>
      - His first wife, whom he eventually rejected. In her desperation to win back his love, Oba mutilated herself based on bad advice from Oshun, leading to her eternal sorrow.

     Sacred Objects
    </h3>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Thunderstones (Edun Ara):
     </strong>
     Prehistoric stone axes and celts found in the ground after lightning strikes are believed to be Shango's thunderbolts. These are kept on his shrine and are central to his worship. The sound of thunder is Shango's voice; the lightning is his weapon striking the earth.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
     <strong>
      Oshe Shango:
     </strong>
     The double-headed axe is Shango's primary symbol. It represents his ability to deliver justice from any direction and the duality of his power - creative and destructive. Priests carry elaborately carved oshe during ceremonies.
    </p>
    <h3 style="color: var(--yoruba-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">
     Sacred Music - Bata Drums
    </h3>
    <p>
     Shango is intimately connected with the bata drums - a set of three double-headed drums that "speak" the Yoruba language. The bata drums were first played for Shango during his reign in Oyo and remain essential to his worship. The drums call the Orisha and induce possession in devotees. Each Orisha has specific rhythms; Shango's rhythms are particularly powerful and complex.
    </p>
    <h3 style="color: var(--yoruba-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">
     Festivals
    </h3>
    <p>
     The annual
     <strong>
      Shango Festival
     </strong>
     in Oyo State, Nigeria, is one of the most spectacular Yoruba festivals. For several days, devotees dance, drum, and make offerings. Priests carrying the oshe demonstrate possession by Shango, sometimes handling fire without being burned. The festival commemorates the king who became a god.

     Shango is the Orisha of divine justice. Those struck by lightning are believed to have committed secret crimes or offenses against the Orisha. When lightning strikes a house, special priests search the rubble for thunderstones and may exact fines from the family. However, if the victim was truly innocent, Shango's priests will perform rituals to rehabilitate their reputation.
