                The terrifying god of death, decay, and the underworld, Ah Puch rules over <span class="mayan-term">Xibalba</span>,
                the Maya realm of the dead. Depicted as a skeletal figure with protruding ribs, exposed spine, and
                a bloated belly of corruption, he embodies the horror and inevitability of death. Yet the Maya
                understood death not as an end but as a transformation - and Ah Puch, however fearsome, was part
                of the cosmic cycle that made rebirth possible. His defeat by the Hero Twins established the
                pattern of death and resurrection at the heart of Maya religion.

                <h3>The Nine Levels of the Underworld</h3>
                <p>
                    Ah Puch reigns over <span class="mayan-term">Xibalba</span> (roughly "Place of Fear" or "Place of
                    Phantoms"), the Maya underworld consisting of nine levels descending beneath the earth. This realm
                    is described in the <em>Popol Vuh</em> as a terrifying place of trials, ruled by twelve death gods
                    who delight in tormenting souls.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                    Souls of the dead had to pass through Xibalba's trials before they could rest. The journey involved
                    crossing rivers of blood and pus, passing through houses of cold, fire, jaguars, bats, and obsidian
                    blades. Only those who died in battle, childbirth, or sacrifice might escape this arduous journey
                    and ascend directly to paradise.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="myth-section">
                <h3>The Twelve Lords of Death</h3>
                <p>
                    According to the <em>Popol Vuh</em>, Xibalba was ruled by twelve death lords, with <span class="mayan-term">Hun Came</span>
                    ("One Death") and <span class="mayan-term">Vucub Came</span> ("Seven Death") as the supreme rulers.
                    Ah Puch is often identified with or as chief among these lords. The other death gods each represented
                    specific forms of death and disease:

                <h3>The Defeat of the Death Lords</h3>
                <p>
                    The central narrative of the <em>Popol Vuh</em> concerns the Hero Twins, <span class="mayan-term">Hunahpu</span>
                    and <span class="mayan-term">Xbalanque</span>, who descended to Xibalba to avenge their father and uncle,
                    who had been killed by the death lords. Through cleverness, trickery, and self-sacrifice, the twins
                    defeated the lords of death, establishing the cosmic pattern of death and rebirth.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                    After allowing themselves to be killed and burned, the twins were reborn from the ashes and returned
                    to Xibalba disguised as traveling performers. They amazed the death lords with their ability to kill
                    and resurrect each other. When Hun Came and Vucub Came demanded to experience this miracle, the twins
                    killed them but did not bring them back, thus breaking the absolute power of death over life.

            <h2>Death in Maya Thought</h2>
            <p>
                Despite his terrifying appearance and role, Ah Puch represented a necessary part of the cosmic cycle.
                The Maya understood death not as an end but as a transformation, a passage to another form of existence.
                Death fed life; the decaying body returned to the earth to nourish new growth. The souls of ancestors
                remained connected to the living, accessible through ritual and prayer.
            </p>
            <p>
                This understanding is reflected in Maya burial practices, which often included rich grave goods,
                elaborate tombs within pyramids, and evidence of ancestor veneration. The dead were not gone but
                transformed, dwelling in Xibalba or in the heavens, maintaining their relationships with the living
                through offerings and ceremonies.

            <h2>Worship and Propitiation</h2>
            <p>
                Unlike deities who were celebrated, Ah Puch was feared and propitiated - offerings were made to
                avert his attention rather than attract his favor. When death came, it was often seen as Ah Puch
                prowling near the homes of the sick, and rituals were performed to drive him away.

            <h2>Modern Significance</h2>
            <p>
                Ah Puch continues to appear in modern Maya culture, particularly during Day of the Dead celebrations
                where pre-Columbian and Catholic traditions merge. His skeletal form finds echoes in the familiar
                calavera imagery of Mexican folk art, though the direct connection between Maya and modern Mexican
                death imagery is complex.
            </p>
            <p>
                In popular culture, Ah Puch has been featured in video games, comics, and fantasy literature as
                a fearsome death god. His distinctive skeletal appearance and role as lord of the underworld make
                him instantly recognizable as a figure of supernatural terror.
            </p>
            <p>
                For scholars of Maya religion, Ah Puch and the Xibalba mythology represent some of the richest
                material for understanding pre-Columbian concepts of death, the afterlife, and the cosmic struggle
                between life and death that the Hero Twins' story so powerfully dramatizes.
