            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
                The great feathered serpent is one of the most important deities of Mesoamerica, worshipped from the
                earliest Olmec civilizations through the Maya and Aztec empires. As K'uk'ulkan among the Yucatec Maya
                and Q'uq'umatz among the K'iche', this winged serpent god brought knowledge, civilization, and the
                sacred calendar to humanity. His descent as a serpent of light at Chichen Itza each equinox remains
                one of the world's most spectacular archaeoastronomical phenomena.

            <h2>Creation Mythology</h2>

            <div class="myth-section">
                <h3>Q'uq'umatz in the Popol Vuh</h3>
                <p>
                    In the K'iche' Maya creation account, <span class="mayan-term">Q'uq'umatz</span> (the K'iche' name for Kukulkan)
                    was one of the primordial creator deities who existed before the world began. Together with
                    <span class="mayan-term">Tepeu</span> (another creator god), Q'uq'umatz floated upon the primordial waters
                    in the darkness, wrapped in blue-green quetzal feathers.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                    Through the power of their word alone, these creator gods brought the earth into being: "Let it be done!
                    Let the void be filled! Let the water recede and make a void, let the earth appear and become solid."
                    Mountains rose from the waters, rivers flowed, and the face of the earth became visible. Q'uq'umatz
                    and Tepeu then created animals and birds, but these could not speak to worship their makers, leading
                    to the gods' multiple attempts to create proper human beings.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="myth-section">
                <h3>The Failed Creations</h3>
                <p>
                    The feathered serpent participated in three attempts to create humanity. First, the gods fashioned
                    beings from mud, but they dissolved in water and could not speak. Second, they carved wooden people,
                    but these lacked souls and proper understanding - they were destroyed in a great flood, their
                    descendants becoming monkeys. Only the third creation, beings made from maize dough, proved successful.
                    These maize people could speak, reason, and worship their creators, becoming the ancestors of the
                    K'iche' Maya.

                <h3>Bringer of Civilization</h3>
                <p>
                    Kukulkan is credited with bringing the essential elements of civilization to humanity. Like his
                    Aztec counterpart Quetzalcoatl, he taught humans agriculture, the arts, writing, and the sacred
                    calendar that ordered both religious and agricultural life. He established the foundations of
                    Maya cities and temple complexes, and some accounts suggest he was the divine patron of rulers
                    and priests, the bearers of sacred knowledge.

        <section style="margin-top: 2rem;">
            <h2>The Historical Kukulkan</h2>
            <p>
                Maya traditions speak of Kukulkan not only as a god but also as a culture hero or priest-king who
                may have been a historical figure later deified. Spanish colonial sources, drawing on Maya oral
                traditions, describe a great leader named Kukulkan who arrived in Yucatan from the west, bringing
                new religious practices and architectural styles.
            </p>
            <p>
                This figure is often associated with the "Toltec" influences visible at Chichen Itza from around
                900-1000 CE, including the Castillo pyramid, the Temple of Warriors, and the prominence of
                feathered serpent imagery. Whether this represents an actual migration of people from central
                Mexico, the spread of a religious cult, or local Maya development remains debated by scholars.

            <h2>The Serpent of Light at Chichen Itza</h2>
            <p>
                The most famous tribute to Kukulkan is El Castillo (the Pyramid of Kukulkan) at Chichen Itza.
                This architectural masterpiece was designed to create a spectacular hierophany during the spring
                and autumn equinoxes. As the sun sets, shadows cast by the pyramid's stepped terraces create the
                illusion of a serpent descending the northern staircase, its body formed of seven triangles of
                light, its head a carved serpent at the staircase's base.
            </p>
            <p>
                This "descent of Kukulkan" draws tens of thousands of visitors each equinox and represents the
                intersection of Maya astronomy, architecture, and religious symbolism. The serpent's descent
                in spring may have signified the god's blessing of the agricultural season, while the autumn
                appearance marked the harvest's completion.
            </p>

            <h2>Worship and Rituals</h2>
            <p>
                Kukulkan's worship reached its height during the Terminal Classic and Postclassic periods
                (900-1500 CE), particularly in the northern Yucatan. Unlike some Maya deities, Kukulkan was
                not strongly associated with human sacrifice, reflecting his character as a civilizing,
                benevolent deity.

            <h2>Modern Significance</h2>
            <p>
                Kukulkan remains one of the most recognized deities of pre-Columbian America. The annual
                equinox phenomenon at Chichen Itza has become a major cultural event, drawing visitors from
                around the world and serving as a powerful symbol of Maya astronomical knowledge and
                architectural achievement.
            </p>
            <p>
                Among contemporary Maya communities, Kukulkan continues to hold significance. Traditional
                Maya priests (<span class="mayan-term">aj k'in</span>) maintain practices honoring the ancient gods,
                and the feathered serpent appears in modern Maya art, literature, and cultural celebrations.
                The god has also been adopted by New Age movements as a symbol of wisdom, transformation,
                and the 2012 phenomenon associated with the Maya calendar.

            <p>
                In Guatemala, the quetzal bird sacred to Kukulkan remains the national symbol and currency,
                representing the enduring cultural legacy of the feathered serpent across the Maya world.
