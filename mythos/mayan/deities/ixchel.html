            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
                The great Moon Goddess of the Maya, Ixchel embodies the creative and destructive powers of feminine
                divinity. As goddess of the moon, childbirth, medicine, and weaving, she presides over the cycles
                of life, fertility, and death. Appearing both as a beautiful young woman and as a fearsome crone,
                she represents the transformative power of the feminine across all stages of life. Her sacred shrine
                on the island of Cozumel drew pilgrims from across the Maya world for centuries.

            <h2>The Dual Goddess</h2>

            <div class="myth-section">
                <h3>Goddess I - The Young Moon</h3>
                <p>
                    In her youthful aspect, Ixchel appears as a beautiful young woman associated with sexuality,
                    fertility, and the waxing moon. She is depicted with long, flowing hair, bare breasts, and
                    often holding a rabbit - the creature the Maya saw in the patterns of the moon's surface.
                    This aspect connects her to romantic love, new life, and the creative power of feminine sexuality.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                    Young Ixchel is often shown with the aged creator god Itzamna, suggesting the union of masculine
                    wisdom with feminine creative power. Their partnership produced the Bacabs (sky-bearer gods) and
                    established the cosmic order. In some accounts, she is associated with the Morning Star and with
                    the sun's consort.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="myth-section">
                <h3>Goddess O - Chak Chel the Crone</h3>
                <p>
                    As <span class="mayan-term">Chak Chel</span> ("Red/Great Rainbow"), Ixchel appears as a powerful
                    aged woman with jaguar attributes - clawed hands, a skirt decorated with crossbones, and a serpent
                    headdress. This aspect represents the destructive face of feminine power, associated with floods,
                    storms, and death. She is depicted pouring water from an overturned jar, bringing either life-giving
                    rain or devastating floods.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                    Far from being feared, Chak Chel was honored as a powerful healing deity. Her association with
                    medicine, midwifery, and divination made her one of the most important goddesses in Maya daily
                    life. The crone aspect represents accumulated wisdom, the power to heal and transform, and the
                    authority of aged women in Maya society.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="myth-section">
                <h3>The Rabbit in the Moon</h3>
                <p>
                    The Maya, like many Mesoamerican peoples, saw a rabbit rather than a face in the moon's markings.
                    According to myth, Ixchel keeps a rabbit as her companion, and this lunar rabbit is associated
                    with fertility, writing (rabbit-scribes appear in Maya art), and the cycles of the moon.
                    The rabbit's rapid reproduction made it a natural symbol of Ixchel's fertility aspects.
                </p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section style="margin-top: 2rem;">
            <h2>Goddess of Childbirth and Medicine</h2>
            <p>
                Ixchel's most important role in daily Maya life was as the patron of childbirth and healing. Pregnant
                women and midwives invoked her blessing, and her sacred shrine on Cozumel was a major pilgrimage
                destination for women seeking fertility or safe childbirth. The journey to her island temple was
                considered both a religious duty and a rite of passage for Maya women.
            </p>
            <p>
                As goddess of medicine, Ixchel worked alongside her consort Itzamna as divine healers. Maya medical
                practice combined herbal remedies with spiritual treatments, and both were under Ixchel's patronage.
                Healers and midwives (<span class="mayan-term">ix alanzah</span>) were considered her servants, channels
                for her healing power.

            <h2>The Art of Weaving</h2>
            <p>
                Weaving was a sacred art among the Maya, and Ixchel was its divine inventor and patron. She taught
                women to spin thread and weave cloth, transforming raw cotton into elaborate textiles. The loom
                itself was seen as a cosmic symbol - the warp and weft representing the intersection of cosmic
                forces, the creation of order from chaos.
            </p>
            <p>
                Maya textiles were works of art encoding social status, regional identity, and sacred symbolism.
                Women weavers saw themselves as participating in divine creativity, their work echoing Ixchel's
                original act of bringing forth cloth from thread. The backstrap loom remains central to Maya
                women's cultural identity today, an unbroken tradition stretching back millennia to Ixchel's
                original teachings.

            <h2>The Sanctuary at Cozumel</h2>
            <p>
                The island of Cozumel ("Island of Swallows") off the coast of Yucatan was Ixchel's most sacred site.
                The Spanish called it <span class="mayan-term">Isla de Mujeres</span> ("Island of Women") because
                of the goddess figurines found there. Women from across the Maya world made pilgrimages to Cozumel
                to seek Ixchel's blessing, particularly for fertility and safe childbirth.
            </p>
            <p>
                The temple of San Gervasio was the center of her cult, where priestesses served as oracles,
                delivering Ixchel's messages to pilgrims. The goddess was said to speak through these women,
                offering guidance on matters of health, fertility, and the future. This oracle tradition continued
                even after the Spanish conquest, testament to the deep devotion Ixchel inspired.

            <h2>Modern Significance</h2>
            <p>
                Ixchel remains one of the most beloved deities of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, particularly among
                women. Her association with childbirth, healing, and weaving speaks to enduring aspects of women's
                experience across cultures and centuries.
            </p>
            <p>
                In contemporary Maya communities, traditional midwives and healers continue practices that honor
                Ixchel, even when syncretized with Catholic elements. The goddess has been embraced by feminist
                spirituality movements as a powerful symbol of feminine divine power in its full complexity -
                creative and destructive, young and old, nurturing and fierce.
            </p>
            <p>
                Maya women weavers today often acknowledge Ixchel as the patron of their art, maintaining a living
                connection to ancient traditions. The backstrap loom, used continuously for over two thousand years,
                remains a symbol of cultural continuity and feminine creative power that traces directly to the
                goddess who first taught humanity to weave.
