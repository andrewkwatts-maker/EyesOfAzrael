    <h2>
     Creation Mythology
    </h2>
    <div class="myth-section">
     <h3>
      Primordial Creator
     </h3>
     <p>
      Itzamna stands among the first and greatest of Maya deities, existing before the world took shape.
                    In some accounts, he is the supreme creative force who brought the universe into being through
                    his divine will. As the great cosmic caiman, his body formed the framework of creation - his
                    back became the earth, his scales the mountains, while the sky stretched above his domain.
     </p>
     <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
      Classical period Maya inscriptions place Itzamna at the apex of the divine hierarchy. He appears
                    as the patron deity of the day
      <span class="mayan-term">
       Ahau
      </span>
      (Lord), the most prestigious
                    day in the Maya calendar, and his blessing was essential for the legitimacy of Maya kings who
                    claimed divine descent and connection to cosmic order.
     </p>
    </div>
    <div class="myth-section">
     <h3>
      The Cosmic Caiman
     </h3>
     <p>
      One of Itzamna's most important manifestations is as
      <span class="mayan-term">
       Itzam Cab Ain
      </span>
      ,
                    the "Earth Caiman" or cosmic crocodile. This vast reptilian being floats upon the primordial
                    waters, his ridged back forming the surface of the earth. The World Tree grows from his spine,
                    connecting the underworld in his belly to the heavens above.
     </p>
     <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
      In iconography, this cosmic caiman appears with a vegetation symbol on its head (representing
                    the earth's fertility) and often with starry markings on its body (representing the night sky).
                    The creature's dual nature - both earthly and celestial - embodies Itzamna's role as lord of
                    both day and night, heaven and earth.
     </p>
    </div>
    <div class="myth-section">
     <h3>
      Father of the Gods
     </h3>
     <p>
      Together with his consort Ixchel, Itzamna fathered the Bacabs - four gods who support the
                    four corners of the sky at the cardinal directions. He is also credited as the father of
                    many other deities in the Maya pantheon. As the divine patriarch, he established the order
                    of the cosmos and the proper relationships between gods, humans, and the forces of nature.
     </p>
    </div>
   </section>
   <section style="margin-top: 2rem;">
    <h2>
     Inventor of Writing and Knowledge
    </h2>
    <p>
     Among Itzamna's greatest gifts to humanity was the invention of writing. The Maya script - one of
                the few complete writing systems independently developed in human history - was attributed to this
                divine creator. Books (
     <span class="mayan-term">
      huun
     </span>
     ) were sacred objects, and scribes were
                honored as practitioners of a divine art inherited from Itzamna himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Itzamna also gave humanity the calendar, that remarkable mathematical and astronomical achievement
                that allowed the Maya to track time across vast cycles. The sacred
     <span class="mayan-term">
      Tzolk'in
     </span>
     (260-day ritual calendar) and the solar
     <span class="mayan-term">
      Haab
     </span>
     (365-day calendar) were
                divine knowledge essential for scheduling rituals, agricultural activities, and understanding one's
                destiny. Itzamna, as patron of the day Ahau, presided over the proper keeping of these sacred counts.

    <h2>
     Medicine and Healing
    </h2>
    <p>
     Itzamna was revered as the divine healer, the source of all medical knowledge. Colonial sources
                record that Maya healers invoked Itzamna and Ixchel in their healing rituals, seeking the
                blessing of these patron deities of medicine. The art of healing was seen as a sacred practice,
                connecting the human healer to divine knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maya medicine combined practical herbal knowledge with spiritual practices. Healers
                (
     <span class="mayan-term">
      ah men
     </span>
     ) used prayers, rituals, and plant medicines to treat
                both physical and spiritual ailments. Itzamna's patronage sanctified this tradition and
                connected it to the cosmic order he established.

    <h2>
     Modern Significance
    </h2>
    <p>
     Itzamna remains one of the most important figures in reconstructing Maya religion and understanding
                their cosmological concepts. His role as supreme creator and inventor of writing makes him central
                to scholarly understanding of Maya intellectual achievements.
    </p>
    <p>
     Among contemporary Maya communities, particularly those maintaining traditional practices, Itzamna
                is still honored as the great creator and patron of knowledge. Traditional healers continue to
                invoke his blessing, and his connection to writing and learning resonates with modern Maya
                cultural revitalization movements that seek to preserve and promote the Maya script and languages.
    </p>
    <p>
     The decipherment of Maya hieroglyphics - the writing Itzamna was said to have invented - represents
                one of the great intellectual achievements of the 20th century, allowing us to finally read the
                voices of the ancient Maya and understand their complex theological ideas about this cosmic creator.
