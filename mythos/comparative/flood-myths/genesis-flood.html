            <h2>Overview: The Flood as Divine Reset</h2>
            <p>
                The Biblical flood narrative (Genesis 6-9) stands as one of the most influential stories in
                Western civilization. More than a mere tale of divine judgment, it functions as a theological
                statement about God's sovereignty over creation, human sinfulness, divine grief, and the
                possibility of renewal through covenant. The flood represents a de-creation—a return to the
                watery chaos of Genesis 1:2—followed by re-creation, with Noah's family serving as a new
                humanity and recipients of universal covenant.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Genesis account transforms earlier Mesopotamian flood stories (Gilgamesh, Atrahasis) from
                polytheistic mythologies featuring capricious gods into monotheistic theology emphasizing moral
                judgment, divine mercy, and covenant faithfulness.

            <div class="verse-quote">
                "When man began to multiply on the face of the land and daughters were born to them, the sons
                of God saw that the daughters of man were attractive. And they took as their wives any they
                chose. Then the LORD said, 'My Spirit shall not abide in man forever, for he is flesh: his days
                shall be 120 years.' The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the
                sons of God came in to the daughters of man and they bore children to them. These were the mighty
                men who were of old, the men of renown." (Genesis 6:1-4 ESV)

                <strong>Book of Enoch Expansion:</strong> 1 Enoch 6-11 provides extensive detail on this cryptic
                passage: 200 Watchers descend on Mt. Hermon, take wives, produce giant offspring (Nephilim),
                teach forbidden knowledge (warfare, sorcery, astrology), leading to cosmic corruption requiring
                flood to cleanse. See <a href="enoch-flood.html">Enoch Flood Account</a> for full details.

            <h4>Genesis 6:5-7: Total Corruption and Divine Grief</h4>
            <div class="verse-quote">
                "The LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the
                thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And the LORD regretted that he had made man on
                the earth, and it grieved him to his heart. So the LORD said, 'I will blot out man whom I have
                created from the face of the land, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens,
                for I am sorry that I have made them.'" (Genesis 6:5-7 ESV)
            </div>

            <p><strong>Theological Notes:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>"Every intention... only evil continually"</strong> - Total depravity, universal corruption</li>
                <li><strong>"The LORD regretted"</strong> - Anthropopathism (human emotions attributed to God); divine grief</li>
                <li><strong>"Grieved him to his heart"</strong> - Profound divine sorrow, not capricious anger</li>
                <li><strong>"Blot out"</strong> - Complete erasure, return to pre-creation state</li>
                <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Humanity, animals, birds - all land creatures affected by human sin</li>

                Noah's Righteousness and the Ark
            </h3>

            <h4>Genesis 6:8-9: Noah Finds Favor</h4>
            <div class="verse-quote">
                "But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD. These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a
                righteous man, blameless in his generation. Noah walked with God." (Genesis 6:8-9 ESV)

            <ul>
                <li><strong>"Found favor"</strong> (חֵן <em>chen</em>) - Grace, unmerited favor (not earned by righteousness)</li>
                <li><strong>"Righteous"</strong> (צַדִּיק <em>tzaddiq</em>) - Just, in right relationship with God</li>
                <li><strong>"Blameless"</strong> (תָּמִים <em>tamim</em>) - Complete, perfect, having integrity</li>
                <li><strong>"In his generation"</strong> - Relative to his corrupt contemporaries, or despite them</li>
                <li><strong>"Walked with God"</strong> - Same phrase used of Enoch (Gen 5:22, 24); intimate relationship</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Genesis 6:11-13: Earth Corrupt and Filled with Violence</h4>
            <div class="verse-quote">
                "Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight, and the earth was filled with violence. And God saw
                the earth, and behold, it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth. And
                God said to Noah, 'I have determined to make an end of all flesh, for the earth is filled with
                violence through them. Behold, I will destroy them with the earth.'" (Genesis 6:11-13 ESV)
            </div>

            <p><strong>Key Terms:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>"Corrupt"</strong> (שָׁחַת <em>shachat</em>) - Spoiled, ruined, destroyed; repeated 3x for emphasis</li>
                <li><strong>"Violence"</strong> (חָמָס <em>chamas</em>) - Injustice, oppression, cruelty, wrong</li>
                <li><strong>"All flesh"</strong> - Universal scope of corruption</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Genesis 6:14-16: Ark Construction Instructions</h4>
            <div class="verse-quote">
                "Make yourself an ark of gopher wood. Make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and out with
                pitch. This is how you are to make it: the length of the ark 300 cubits, its breadth 50 cubits,
                and its height 30 cubits. Make a roof for the ark, and finish it to a cubit above, and set the
                door of the ark in its side. Make it with lower, second, and third decks." (Genesis 6:14-16 ESV)

                <li><strong>"Blow over the earth"</strong> - Parallels Gen 1:2 "Spirit hovering over waters"</li>

                flood, and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.' And God said, 'This is the sign

                future generations: I have set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me
                and the earth. When I bring clouds over the earth and the bow is seen in the clouds, I will remember
                my covenant that is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh. And the waters shall
                never again become a flood to destroy all flesh. When the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and
