            <h2>Overview: The Epic of Gilgamesh</h2>
            <p>
                The Epic of Gilgamesh, discovered on clay tablets in ancient Nineveh (modern Iraq), represents humanity's
                oldest known epic literature. Tablet 11 contains a flood narrative remarkably parallel to Genesis, predating
                the biblical text by centuries. The story is told by Utnapishtim ("He Who Saw the Deep"), the flood survivor,
                to Gilgamesh, king of Uruk, who seeks him to learn the secret of immortality.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Dating:</strong> Standard Babylonian version (Tablet 11) c. 1200 BCE; Earlier Sumerian versions c. 2100 BCE;
                Proto-Gilgamesh stories c. 2600-2500 BCE
            </p>

            <h2>Context: Gilgamesh's Quest for Immortality</h2>
            <p>
                After his friend Enkidu dies, Gilgamesh becomes obsessed with escaping death. He travels to the ends of the
                earth seeking Utnapishtim, the only mortal granted eternal life by the gods. Upon finding him, Gilgamesh asks
                how he achieved immortality. Utnapishtim's answer is the flood story - his immortality was reward for survival.
            </p>

            <h2>Tablet 11: The Flood Narrative</h2>

            <h3>Divine Council Decides Destruction</h3>
            <div class="akkadian-quote">
                "In those days the world teemed, the people multiplied, the world bellowed like a wild bull, and the great
                god was aroused by the clamor. Enlil heard the clamor and he said to the gods in council, 'The uproar of
                mankind is intolerable and sleep is no longer possible by reason of the babel.'"
            </div>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reason:</strong> Human noise disturbing gods (especially Enlil)</li>
                <li><strong>Council:</strong> Gods collectively decide on flood</li>
                <li><strong>Notable:</strong> Not moral judgment but divine annoyance</li>
                <li><strong>Dissent:</strong> Ea (Enki) sympathetic to humanity, opposes plan</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Ea Warns Utnapishtim</h3>
            <div class="akkadian-quote">
                "Man of Shuruppak, son of Ubar-Tutu, tear down your house and build a boat, abandon possessions and look
                for life, despise worldly goods and save your soul alive. Tear down your house, I say, and build a boat...
                Take up into the boat the seed of all living creatures."
            </div>

            <p><strong>Method of Warning:</strong> Ea speaks to a reed wall, not directly to Utnapishtim (obeying letter of
            divine decree not to warn humans, while violating spirit)</p>

            <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Abandon possessions, seek life</li>
                <li>Build boat with specific dimensions</li>
                <li>Take seed of all living things</li>
                <li>Bring family and craftsmen</li>

            <div class="akkadian-quote">
                "With the first light of dawn a black cloud arose from the horizon. Inside it Adad [storm god] thunders...
                The Anunnaki [gods] raised their torches, lighting the land with their livid flame. A stupor of despair went
                up to heaven when the god of the storm turned daylight into darkness, when he smashed the land like a cup...
                One whole day the tempest raged, gathering fury as it went, it poured over the people like the tides of battle;
                a man could not see his brother nor the people be seen from heaven. Even the gods were terrified at the flood,
                they fled to the highest heaven, the firmament of Anu; they crouched against the walls, cowering like curs."
            </div>

            <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Six days and seven nights</p>

            <p><strong>Divine Terror:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Gods frightened by their own creation</li>
                <li>Flee to highest heaven</li>
                <li>"Cowering like dogs"</li>
                <li>Ishtar regrets decision, wails like woman in childbirth</li>
                <li>"The gods wept with her for the destruction"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Subsiding and Landing</h3>
            <div class="akkadian-quote">
                "When the seventh day dawned the storm from the south subsided, the sea grew calm, the flood was stilled...
                On the mountain of Nisir the boat grounded; on the mountain of Nisir she held fast, she held fast and did not
                budge."

            <p><strong>Mount Nisir (Nimush):</strong> Mountain in Kurdistan region (modern northern Iraq)</p>

            <h3>The Bird Sequence</h3>
            <div class="akkadian-quote">
                "When the seventh day dawned I loosed a dove and let her go. She flew away, but finding no resting-place she
                returned. Then I loosed a swallow, and she flew away but finding no resting-place she returned. I loosed a
                raven, she saw that the waters had retreated, she ate, she flew around, she cawed, and she did not come back."

            <h3>The Sacrifice</h3>
            <div class="akkadian-quote">
                "Then I threw everything open to the four winds, I made a sacrifice and poured out a libation on the mountain
                top. Seven and again seven cauldrons I set up on their stands, I heaped up wood and cane and cedar and myrtle.
                When the gods smelled the sweet savor, they gathered like flies over the sacrifice."
            </div>

            <p><strong>Divine Response:</strong> "The gods crowded like flies about the sacrificer" - striking image of deity
            dependence on human worship</p>

            <h3>Ishtar's Regret</h3>
            <div class="akkadian-quote">
                "When at last Ishtar arrived she lifted her necklace with the jewels of heaven that once Anu had made to please
                her. 'O you gods here present, by the lapis lazuli round my neck I shall remember these days as I remember the
                jewels of my throat; these last days I shall not forget.'"
            </div>

            <h3>Enlil's Fury and Resolution</h3>
            <div class="akkadian-quote">
                "When Enlil arrived and saw the boat he was angry... 'Has any of these mortals escaped? Not one was to have
                survived the destruction.' Then Ea opened his mouth and spoke to warrior Enlil, 'Wisest of gods, hero Enlil,
                how could you so senselessly bring down the flood? Lay upon the sinner his sin, lay upon the transgressor his
                transgression, punish him a little when he breaks loose, do not drive him too hard or he perishes; would that
                a lion had ravaged mankind rather than the flood; would that a wolf had ravaged mankind rather than the flood;
                would that famine had wasted the world rather than the flood; would that pestilence had wasted mankind rather
                than the flood.'"
            </div>

            <p><strong>Ea's Rebuke:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Flood was indiscriminate, unjust</li>
                <li>Should punish guilty, not destroy all</li>
                <li>Better: Lion, wolf, famine, pestilence - selective judgments</li>
                <li>Flood too extreme</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Immortality Granted</h3>
            <div class="akkadian-quote">
                "Then Enlil went up into the boat, he took me by the hand and my wife and made us enter the boat and kneel down
                on either side, he standing between us. He touched our foreheads to bless us saying, 'In time past Utnapishtim
                was a mortal man; henceforth he and his wife shall live in the distance at the mouth of the rivers.' Thus it was
                that the gods took me and placed me here to live in the distance, at the mouth of the rivers."
            </div>

            <p><strong>Reward:</strong> Utnapishtim and wife granted immortality, removed to dwelling "at mouth of rivers"
            (possibly confluence of Tigris/Euphrates, or mythical world's end)</p>

                <h4>1. Genesis Borrowed from Gilgamesh</h4>
                <p><strong>Arguments:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gilgamesh older (Standard version 1200 BCE vs Genesis composition c. 1400-500 BCE)</li>
                    <li>Israel in contact with Mesopotamian culture (Abraham from Ur, exile in Babylon)</li>
                    <li>Structural parallels too similar to be independent</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Counter:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Oral traditions may predate written forms</li>
                    <li>Genesis transforms polytheism into monotheism - sophisticated theology, not mere copying</li>
                    <li>Details differ significantly (ark shape, duration, moral framework)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="tablet-section">
                <h4>2. Both Derived from Common Source</h4>
                <p><strong>Arguments:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Older Sumerian flood myths (Eridu Genesis c. 1600 BCE, Atrahasis c. 1700 BCE)</li>
                    <li>Actual catastrophic flood(s) in Mesopotamia preserved in multiple traditions</li>
                    <li>Each culture adapted shared memory to own theology</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Evidence:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Flood deposits at Ur, Shuruppak archaeologically confirmed</li>
                    <li>Multiple Mesopotamian versions suggest widespread tradition</li>
                    <li>Genesis and Gilgamesh both preserve core elements while diverging on theology</li>

            <div class="tablet-section">
                <h4>3. Independent Development</h4>
                <p><strong>Arguments:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Flood myths worldwide (200+ cultures) suggest universal experience or archetype</li>
                    <li>Basic elements (boat, animals, mountain, birds) logical responses to flood scenario</li>

                <ul>

                    <li>Geographic proximity (Mesopotamia) makes contact inevitable</li>

            <h3>Scholarly Consensus</h3>
            <p>
                Most scholars accept literary relationship between Gilgamesh and Genesis, with debate over direction of
                borrowing vs common source. Discovery of Gilgamesh tablets (1872) created crisis for biblical literalism
                but also demonstrated ancient Near Eastern literary context of Genesis. Modern view: Genesis transforms
                common Mesopotamian flood tradition into sophisticated monotheistic theology emphasizing moral judgment,
                divine sovereignty, and covenant faithfulness.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-card">
            <h2>Theological Significance</h2>

            <h3>What Genesis Transforms</h3>

            <p><strong>From Polytheism to Monotheism:</strong> Multiple quarreling gods → One sovereign God</p>

            <p><strong>From Capriciousness to Justice:</strong> Disturbed sleep → Moral corruption requiring judgment</p>

            <p><strong>From Divine Fear to Divine Grief:</strong> Gods cowering in terror → God grieved to his heart (Gen 6:6)</p>

            <p><strong>From Technicality to Relationship:</strong> Ea tricking decree via reed wall → God directly calling Noah</p>

            <p><strong>From Regret to Covenant:</strong> Ishtar wailing over mistake → God promising never again, establishing
            rainbow covenant</p>

            <p><strong>From Reward to Grace:</strong> Immortality as special reward → Salvation by grace through faith
            (Heb 11:7)</p>

            <h3>Why the Parallels Matter</h3>

            <p>
                The Gilgamesh parallels demonstrate that Genesis doesn't exist in cultural vacuum. It engages contemporary
                flood traditions, using shared narrative framework to present radically different theology. The flood story
                becomes polemic against Mesopotamian religion: Your gods are capricious and weak; our God is just and sovereign.
                Your flood was cosmic accident; ours was moral necessity followed by covenant mercy.
