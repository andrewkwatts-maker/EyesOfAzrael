            <h2>Overview: Expanding Genesis 6:1-4</h2>
            <p>
                The Book of Enoch (1 Enoch) provides extensive narrative detail on one of the Bible's most cryptic
                passages: Genesis 6:1-4, which briefly mentions "sons of God" taking "daughters of men" as wives and
                producing the Nephilim. Where Genesis offers four verses, Enoch devotes entire chapters to explaining
                what led to the flood: a cosmic rebellion of angelic beings ("Watchers"), their illicit union with human
                women, the birth of giant hybrid offspring, and the teaching of forbidden knowledge that corrupted
                humanity beyond redemption.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the Enochic tradition, the flood becomes not merely judgment on human wickedness, but necessary
                purification of earth contaminated by angelic transgression, hybrid creatures, and forbidden arts.
                The Watchers are bound until final judgment, the Nephilim destroyed, and Noah preserved to maintain
                pure human lineage. This expanded narrative profoundly influenced Second Temple Judaism, early
                Christianity (cited in Jude), and apocalyptic literature.

            <h2>📖 Genesis 6:1-4: The Cryptic Passage</h2>
            <div class="enoch-quote">
                "When man began to multiply on the face of the land and daughters were born to them, the sons of God
                saw that the daughters of man were attractive. And they took as their wives any they chose. Then the
                LORD said, 'My Spirit shall not abide in man forever, for he is flesh: his days shall be 120 years.'
                The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the
                daughters of man and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men who were of old, the men of
                renown." (Genesis 6:1-4 ESV)
            </div>

            <h3>The Questions Genesis Leaves Unanswered:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Who are "sons of God"?</strong> Divine beings? Descendants of Seth? Royal figures?</li>
                <li><strong>What are Nephilim?</strong> Giants? Fallen ones? Hybrid creatures?</li>
                <li><strong>Why did this provoke flood?</strong> What was the nature of the corruption?</li>
                <li><strong>What happened to them?</strong> How were they destroyed? What became of the "sons of God"?</li>
                <li><strong>"And also afterward"?</strong> How did Nephilim survive the flood (Numbers 13:33)?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Book of Enoch's Answer:</h3>
            <p>
                1 Enoch provides detailed narrative answering all these questions: 200 angelic Watchers descend,
                take oaths on Mt. Hermon, marry human women, produce giant offspring called Nephilim, teach
                forbidden knowledge (weapons, magic, astrology), corrupt all flesh, leading to divine intervention
                through both angelic judgment (Watchers bound, Nephilim destroyed by mutual slaughter) and the
                flood to cleanse earth.

            <h2>🔥 1 Enoch 6: The Descent of the Watchers</h2>

            <div class="chapter-heading">1 Enoch 6:1-6</div>
            <div class="enoch-quote">
                "And it came to pass when the children of men had multiplied that in those days were born unto them
                beautiful and comely daughters. And the angels, the children of the heaven, saw and lusted after them,
                and said to one another: 'Come, let us choose us wives from among the children of men and beget us
                children.' And Semjaza, who was their leader, said unto them: 'I fear ye will not indeed agree to do
                this deed, and I alone shall have to pay the penalty of a great sin.' And they all answered him and
                said: 'Let us all swear an oath, and all bind ourselves by mutual imprecations not to abandon this plan
                but to do this thing.' Then sware they all together and bound themselves by mutual imprecations upon it."
            </div>

            <h3>The Conspiracy on Mount Hermon</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Motivation:</strong> Angels see beautiful human women, lust after them</li>
                <li><strong>Leader:</strong> Semjaza (Shemihazah) - recognizes the sin, fears consequences</li>
                <li><strong>Oath:</strong> All 200 swear together, bind by mutual curse - shared guilt</li>
                <li><strong>Mount Hermon:</strong> Hebrew <em>herem</em> (חֵרֶם) = oath, ban, devoted thing; mountain named
                for their conspiracy</li>
                <li><strong>Premeditated:</strong> Not impulsive but calculated rebellion</li>

                those men the seven first white ones, and commanded that they should bring before Him, beginning with the
                first star which led the way, all the stars whose privy members were like those of horses, and they brought
                them all before Him. And He said to that man who wrote before Him, being one of those seven white ones, and

                his long locks were white as wool, and his eyes beautiful. And when he opened his eyes, he lighted up the
                whole house like the sun, and the whole house was very bright. And thereupon he arose in the hands of the
                midwife, opened his mouth, and conversed with the Lord of righteousness."

                angels of heaven transgressed the word of the Lord. And behold they commit sin and transgress the law,
                and have united themselves with women and commit sin with them, and have married some of them, and have
                begotten children by them. And they shall produce on the earth giants not according to the spirit, but
                according to the flesh, and there shall be a great punishment on the earth, and the earth shall be cleansed

                <div class="significance-card">
                    <h3>1. Cosmic Scope of Flood</h3>
                    <p>
                        The flood judges not merely human sin but angelic rebellion. It's cosmic cleansing, not just
                        human punishment. Watchers bound, Nephilim destroyed, earth purified of supernatural contamination.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="significance-card">
                    <h3>2. Genetic Corruption</h3>
                    <p>
                        Nephilim represent genetic/spiritual corruption of human race. Noah "perfect in his generations"
                        (Gen 6:9) may mean genetically pure, not Nephilim-corrupted. Flood preserves pure human line.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="significance-card">
                    <h3>3. Forbidden Knowledge</h3>
                    <p>
                        Technology and occult knowledge inappropriately revealed. Weapons, sorcery, astrology - premature
                        revelation leading to corruption. Flood resets technological development, purges occult practices.
                    </p>

                <div class="significance-card">
                    <h3>4. Bound Until Judgment</h3>
                    <p>
                        Watchers not destroyed but imprisoned "for seventy generations" until final judgment. Referenced
                        in 2 Peter 2:4 ("angels who sinned... cast into hell") and Jude 6 ("angels... kept in darkness,
                        bound with everlasting chains").

                    <h3>5. Post-Flood Nephilim Problem</h3>
                    <p>
                        Genesis 6:4 says Nephilim were "also afterward" - Numbers 13:33 confirms giants in Canaan.
                        How did they survive? Theories: Ham's wife carried genetics, another incursion, or "Nephilim"
                        became general term for giants.

                    <p>
                        Jude 14-15 directly quotes 1 Enoch 1:9. Jude 6 and 2 Peter 2:4 reference Watchers. Early
                        Christianity treated Enochic traditions as authentic history, not mere mythology.
