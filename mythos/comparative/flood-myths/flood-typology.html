            <h2>Introduction: Typology and the Flood</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Typology:</strong> The study of how Old Testament events, persons, and institutions prefigure or foreshadow New Testament realities. The flood serves as one of the Bible's most developed types, pointing to baptism, final judgment, and new creation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The New Testament explicitly identifies the flood as a <em>typos</em> (type) in multiple passages, seeing it as pattern of God's salvation-through-judgment that repeats throughout redemptive history and finds ultimate fulfillment in Christ.

                <h3>Theological Significance</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Flood as Un-creation:</strong> God reverses creation order, returns earth to Genesis 1:2 chaos</li>
                    <li><strong>Divine Reset:</strong> God wipes slate clean, starts over with righteous remnant</li>
                    <li><strong>Noah as New Adam:</strong> Receives same blessing/mandate as Adam</li>
                    <li><strong>Pattern:</strong> Establishes God's ability/willingness to end and restart creation</li>
                    <li><strong>Hope:</strong> Even total corruption doesn't thwart God's purposes - He can re-create</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>💧 Flood as Type of Baptism</h2>

            <div style="background: rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.1); padding: 2rem; border-radius: 12px; margin: 2rem 0;">
                <h3>1 Peter 3:18-22 - Primary NT Flood Typology</h3>

                <div style="background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 10px; margin: 1.5rem 0; font-style: italic;">
                    "For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit, in which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison, because they formerly did not obey, when God's patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through water. Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him." (1 Peter 3:18-22 ESV)
                </div>

                <h3>Peter's Typological Connections</h3>

                <h4>"Eight Persons Saved Through Water"</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Greek:</strong> <em>di' hydatos</em> - "through water" (not "from water")</li>
                    <li><strong>Paradox:</strong> Water = instrument of both judgment (drowning wicked) AND salvation (bearing up ark)</li>
                    <li><strong>Same in baptism:</strong> Water = death to old life AND resurrection to new</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>"Baptism, Which Corresponds to This, Now Saves You"</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Greek:</strong> <em>antitypon</em> = "antitype," "corresponding type"</li>
                    <li><strong>Flood = type; Baptism = antitype</strong> (fulfillment of pattern)</li>
                    <li><strong>"Now saves you":</strong> Not magical (1 Pet 3:21 "not removal of dirt") but "appeal to God for good conscience"</li>
                    <li><strong>Saves through resurrection:</strong> Union with Christ's death/resurrection (Rom 6:3-4)</li>
                </ul>

            <div style="background: rgba(168, 85, 247, 0.1); padding: 2rem; border-radius: 12px; margin: 2rem 0;">
                <h3>Church Fathers on Flood Typology</h3>

                <h4>Justin Martyr (c. 150 CE)</h4>
                <p><em>Dialogue with Trypho:</em> "The righteous Noah with the other people of the flood, that is his wife, his three sons, and their wives, total eight in number, were a symbol of the eighth day in which Christ appeared when he rose from the dead."</p>

                <h4>Tertullian (c. 200 CE)</h4>
                <p><em>On Baptism:</em> "The world, cleansed once for all by a baptism of water, was set free from its past sins. The ark was the type of the Church... Noah with his family was saved through water - this was the antitype of baptism."</p>

                <h4>Cyprian (c. 250 CE)</h4>
                <p><em>Epistle 74:</em> "In the ark of Noah, none could be saved except those who were inside the ark. So too in the Church, none can be saved except those who are within."</p>

                <h4>Augustine (c. 400 CE)</h4>
                <p><em>City of God:</em> "The ark is a type of the City of God on pilgrimage in this world, that is, of the Church which is saved through the wood on which was suspended the Mediator of God and men (the cross)."</p>

                <h3>Liturgical Use</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Easter Vigil:</strong> Flood account traditionally read as OT lesson (pre-baptism)</li>
                    <li><strong>Baptismal liturgies:</strong> Reference flood, ark, eight saved</li>
                    <li><strong>Baptismal fonts:</strong> Often octagonal (eight-sided) symbolizing resurrection</li>
                    <li><strong>Noah as saint:</strong> Commemorated in many traditions as righteous hero of faith</li>
