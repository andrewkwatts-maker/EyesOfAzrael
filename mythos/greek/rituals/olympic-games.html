<h2>Sacred Athletic Festival at Olympia</h2>
<p>
The <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Olympic Games" data-tradition="greek" href="../../../mythos/greek/corpus-search.html?term=olympic%20games" title="Search corpus">Olympic Games</a>
were far more than athletic competitions - they were a sacred festival honoring <a href="../deities/zeus.html">Zeus</a>, king of the gods,
held every four years at his great sanctuary in Olympia. For five days, the Greek world paused in sacred truce (ekecheiria) as athletes,
spectators, and pilgrims gathered to witness human excellence dedicated to divine glory. The games combined religious ritual, artistic
performance, and physical contests, embodying the Greek ideal of <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Kalokagathia" data-tradition="greek" href="../../../mythos/greek/corpus-search.html?term=kalokagathia" title="Search corpus">kalokagathia</a>
(beauty and goodness united).
