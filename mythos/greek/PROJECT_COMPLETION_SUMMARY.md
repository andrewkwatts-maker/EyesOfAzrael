## Recommendations

### For Next Session
1. **Start with deity pages** - They are referenced most frequently and fix the most broken links
2. **Use existing pages as templates** - Zeus, Athena, Apollo, Hera, and Poseidon provide excellent patterns
3. **Create heroes section next** - High value, interesting content that will draw readers
4. **Batch similar pages** - Do all herb pages in one session, all ritual pages in another

### Content Sources
Consult ARCHETYPE_MAPPINGS.md for:
- Deity matchings and quality ratings
- Evidence from primary sources
- Cross-tradition parallels
- Mythological details already researched

### Link Fixing Strategy
1. Create all Priority 1 pages (deities and cosmology)
2. Run a link check on all existing pages
3. Update broken links in batch
4. Verify cross-references

---

## Conclusion

**Summary:**
This session established a solid foundation by creating 3 comprehensive pages (Hera, Poseidon, Underworld) and documenting the complete project scope. The existing 13 pages are of high quality and provide excellent templates for the remaining 67 pages.

**Strengths:**
- Excellent existing content quality
- Clear structure defined in STRUCTURE.md
- Comprehensive archetype mappings in ARCHETYPE_MAPPINGS.md
- Consistent styling and templates established
- Good navigation hierarchy

**Next Steps:**
1. Complete remaining 9 deity pages (highest priority)
2. Complete remaining 3 cosmology pages
3. Create heroes section (high interest value)
4. Proceed through remaining sections systematically

**Final Note:**
The Greek mythology section, when complete, will be one of the most comprehensive digital resources for game designers, writers, and mythology enthusiasts—combining scholarly accuracy with practical applications.
