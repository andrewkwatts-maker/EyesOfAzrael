<h2><a class="corpus-link" data-term="Achilles" data-tradition="greek" href="../../../mythos/greek/corpus-search.html?term=achilles" title="Search corpus for 'Achilles'">Achilles</a></h2>
<p class="subtitle" style="font-size: 1.3rem; margin: 0.5rem 0;">The Invincible Warrior of the Trojan War</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;"><a class="corpus-link" data-term="Achilles" data-tradition="greek" href="../../../mythos/greek/corpus-search.html?term=achilles" title="Search corpus for 'Achilles'">Achilles</a>, son of the mortal king Peleus and the sea-nymph Thetis, stands as the greatest warrior in Greek mythology. His story embodies the tragic hero archetype—a man of unparalleled martial prowess whose very invincibility becomes the stage for his doom. The central figure of Homer's <em>Iliad</em>, Achilles chose eternal glory over a long, peaceful life, and his choice reverberates through Western literature as the quintessential expression of heroic values and their terrible cost.</p>

<h3 style="color: var(--color-primary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">Birth and Prophecy</h3>
<p>Achilles was born to Peleus, king of the Myrmidons in Phthia, and Thetis, a Nereid (sea-nymph) of extraordinary beauty. The gods had once desired Thetis, but when the Titan <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Prometheus" data-tradition="greek" href="../../../mythos/greek/corpus-search.html?term=prometheus" title="Search corpus for 'Prometheus'">Prometheus</a> revealed a prophecy that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father, <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Zeus" data-tradition="greek" href="../../../mythos/greek/corpus-search.html?term=zeus" title="Search corpus for 'Zeus'">Zeus</a> arranged her marriage to a mortal. This ensured the child would be merely human, not a threat to divine order.</p>

<p>Yet another prophecy haunted Achilles from birth: he would either live a long, unremarkable life in obscurity, or die young at Troy having achieved imperishable glory (<em>kleos aphthiton</em>). This terrible choice would define his entire existence. Thetis, knowing her son's fate, attempted to make him immortal by dipping the infant Achilles into the River Styx, which rendered his body invulnerable—except for the heel by which she held him. This vulnerability would prove fatal.</p>

<p>When the <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Trojan War" data-tradition="greek" href="../../../mythos/greek/corpus-search.html?term=troy" title="Search corpus for 'Trojan War'">Trojan War</a> loomed, Thetis hid the young Achilles among the daughters of King Lycomedes on the island of Skyros, disguising him in women's clothing. But <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Odysseus" data-tradition="greek" href="../../../mythos/greek/corpus-search.html?term=odysseus" title="Search corpus for 'Odysseus'">Odysseus</a>, knowing the Greeks could not win without Achilles, cleverly discovered him by placing weapons among feminine gifts—Achilles alone reached for the arms, revealing his warrior nature.</p>

<h3 style="color: var(--color-primary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">The Wrath of Achilles</h3>
<p>The <em>Iliad</em> opens not with Achilles in battle, but in rage. In the tenth year of the Trojan War, Agamemnon, commander of the Greek forces, seized Briseis—a war prize and captive woman whom Achilles valued deeply—to replace his own captive Chryseis, whom he was forced to return. This public dishonor triggered Achilles' legendary wrath (<em>menis</em>). He withdrew from battle, taking his Myrmidon warriors with him, and prayed to Thetis to ask <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Zeus" data-tradition="greek" href="../../../mythos/greek/corpus-search.html?term=zeus" title="Search corpus for 'Zeus'">Zeus</a> to grant the Trojans victory until the Greeks recognized his honor.</p>

<p><a class="corpus-link" data-term="Zeus" data-tradition="greek" href="../../../mythos/greek/corpus-search.html?term=zeus" title="Search corpus for 'Zeus'">Zeus</a> agreed, and without Achilles, the Greeks suffered devastating losses. Hector, Troy's greatest champion, led the Trojan forces to the very ships of the Greek fleet. Desperate embassies pleaded with Achilles to return, offering magnificent gifts and the restoration of Briseis, but Achilles refused—the slight to his honor cut too deep.</p>

<h3 style="color: var(--color-primary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">The Death of Patroclus</h3>
<p>Achilles' beloved companion Patroclus—whether friend, cousin, or lover (ancient sources vary)—could not bear to watch the Greeks perish. He begged Achilles to let him wear Achilles' armor and lead the Myrmidons into battle, hoping the Trojans would mistake him for Achilles and retreat in fear. Achilles reluctantly agreed but warned Patroclus only to drive the Trojans from the ships, not to pursue them to Troy's walls.</p>

<p>Patroclus, swept up in battle fury, ignored this warning. He pushed the Trojans back to Troy's gates, where <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Apollo" data-tradition="greek" href="../../../mythos/greek/corpus-search.html?term=apollo" title="Search corpus for 'Apollo'">Apollo</a>, protector of Troy, struck him and left him vulnerable. The Trojan warrior Euphorbos wounded him, and finally Hector delivered the killing blow, stripping Achilles' armor from Patroclus's corpse.</p>

<p>When Achilles learned of Patroclus's death, his grief exceeded even his rage. He wailed so terribly that Thetis heard him from the depths of the sea. His mother brought him new armor forged by <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Hephaestus" data-tradition="greek" href="../../../mythos/greek/corpus-search.html?term=hephaestus" title="Search corpus for 'Hephaestus'">Hephaestus</a> himself—including the famous Shield of Achilles, decorated with scenes of human life in peace and war. Reconciled with Agamemnon but caring nothing for honor anymore, Achilles returned to battle with a single purpose: revenge.</p>

<h3 style="color: var(--color-primary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">Vengeance and the Death of Hector</h3>
<p>Achilles' return to combat was apocalyptic. He slaughtered Trojans by the hundreds, choked the River Scamander with corpses, and fought the river-god himself when the waters rose in protest. Gods joined the battle—<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Athena" data-tradition="greek" href="../../../mythos/greek/corpus-search.html?term=athena" title="Search corpus for 'Athena'">Athena</a> and <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Hera" data-tradition="greek" href="../../../mythos/greek/corpus-search.html?term=hera" title="Search corpus for 'Hera'">Hera</a> supporting the Greeks, <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Apollo" data-tradition="greek" href="../../../mythos/greek/corpus-search.html?term=apollo" title="Search corpus for 'Apollo'">Apollo</a> and <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Ares" data-tradition="greek" href="../../../mythos/greek/corpus-search.html?term=ares" title="Search corpus for 'Ares'">Ares</a> defending Troy. Nothing could stand before Achilles' fury.</p>

<p>Finally, Achilles faced Hector outside Troy's walls. Hector initially fled, and Achilles chased him three times around the city until <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Athena" data-tradition="greek" href="../../../mythos/greek/corpus-search.html?term=athena" title="Search corpus for 'Athena'">Athena</a> deceived Hector into making a stand. In the duel, Achilles knew every weakness of his own armor, now worn by Hector. He drove his spear through Hector's throat, then committed an act that horrified even the Greeks: he tied Hector's corpse to his chariot and dragged it around Troy's walls and back to the Greek camp, refusing to allow proper burial rites.</p>

<p>For twelve days, Achilles desecrated Hector's body, dragging it daily around Patroclus's tomb. But the gods preserved the corpse from corruption, and finally <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Zeus" data-tradition="greek" href="../../../mythos/greek/corpus-search.html?term=zeus" title="Search corpus for 'Zeus'">Zeus</a> commanded Achilles to relent. Priam, king of Troy and Hector's father, came secretly to Achilles' tent and begged for his son's body. The old king's courage and grief finally moved Achilles to pity, reminding him of his own father. He granted Priam's request, and the <em>Iliad</em> ends with Hector's funeral—a moment of shared humanity between enemies.</p>

<h3 style="color: var(--color-primary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">The Death of Achilles</h3>
<p>The <em>Iliad</em> ends before Achilles' death, but later sources tell how prophecy came to pass. Paris, Hector's brother and the prince whose abduction of Helen started the war, shot an arrow guided by <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Apollo" data-tradition="greek" href="../../../mythos/greek/corpus-search.html?term=apollo" title="Search corpus for 'Apollo'">Apollo</a> that struck Achilles in his vulnerable heel—the only place he could be wounded. The greatest warrior of the age died from an arrow to the ankle, validating his mother's fears and the prophecy of his early death.</p>

<p>The Greeks awarded Achilles' magnificent armor to <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Odysseus" data-tradition="greek" href="../../../mythos/greek/corpus-search.html?term=odysseus" title="Search corpus for 'Odysseus'">Odysseus</a> rather than to Ajax, who had fought beside Achilles. This slight drove Ajax to madness and suicide. According to the <em>Odyssey</em>, Achilles' shade dwells in the <a href="../cosmology/underworld.html">Underworld</a>, where <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Odysseus" data-tradition="greek" href="../../../mythos/greek/corpus-search.html?term=odysseus" title="Search corpus for 'Odysseus'">Odysseus</a> meets him and praises his glory. But Achilles responds with one of Greek literature's most haunting lines: he would rather be a living slave than king of all the dead—suggesting that even imperishable glory may not compensate for life itself.</p>

<h3 style="color: var(--color-primary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">Character and Legacy</h3>
<p>Achilles embodies the heroic ideal at its most extreme and problematic. He is courage incarnate, capable of feats no other warrior could match. His loyalty to Patroclus demonstrates the Greek ideal of <em>philia</em> (deep friendship). Yet his rage leads him to withdraw from battle while his comrades die, and his treatment of Hector's corpse violates sacred custom.</p>

<p>He represents the heroic code in its purest form: the pursuit of glory (<em>kleos</em>) and honor (<em>timē</em>) above all else, including life itself. His choice of a short, glorious life over a long, peaceful one crystallizes the values of a warrior culture where eternal fame was the only true immortality. Yet the <em>Iliad</em> never glorifies war simplistically—Achilles' story shows its terrible cost, the grief of mothers, fathers, friends, and enemies alike.</p>

<p>The "Achilles' heel" has become proverbial—a fatal weakness in an otherwise invincible person or system. His rage, his grief, his terrible prowess, and his moment of compassion with Priam make him perhaps the most psychologically complex hero of Greek mythology. He is simultaneously superhuman and deeply, tragically human.</p>
