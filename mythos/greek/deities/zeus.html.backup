            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-primary);">Mythology & Stories</h2>
            <p>Zeus's mythology spans the entire Greek cosmos—from the overthrow of the Titans to countless interactions with mortals. His stories reveal the nature of divine power, justice, and the relationship between gods and humanity.</p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">Key Myths:</h3>
            <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>The Titanomachy:</strong> Zeus led his siblings in a ten-year war against the Titans, overthrowing his father Kronos and establishing the Olympian order. He freed the Cyclopes and Hecatoncheires from Tartarus, who gifted him the thunderbolt, Poseidon the trident, and Hades the helm of darkness. After victory, Zeus divided the cosmos: sky for himself, sea for Poseidon, underworld for Hades.</li>
                <li><strong>Birth and Concealment:</strong> Kronos, warned that his children would overthrow him, swallowed each child at birth. Rhea saved Zeus by giving Kronos a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes, hiding the infant in a cave on Crete where he was nursed by the goat Amalthea and protected by the Kouretes, whose dancing and shield-clashing drowned his cries.</li>
                <li><strong>The Gigantomachy:</strong> After defeating the Titans, Zeus faced the Giants, monstrous sons of Gaia who sought to overthrow Olympus. Prophecy declared the Giants could only fall to a combined force of gods and mortals; thus Zeus recruited Heracles, and together they defeated the uprising, establishing Olympian supremacy.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">Zeus and Mortals:</h3>
            <p>Zeus's relationships with mortals—both romantic and judicial—fill Greek mythology. He famously transformed himself to seduce mortal women: appearing as a swan to Leda, a bull to Europa, a shower of gold to Danaë, and a mortal husband to Alkmene. These unions produced many of Greece's greatest heroes, including Perseus, Heracles, and Helen of Troy. As upholder of xenia (guest-friendship) and justice, Zeus punished oath-breakers and those who showed hubris (excessive pride), but also protected supplicants and strangers.</p>

            </ul>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1rem;">Allies & Enemies</h3>

        <section style="margin-top: 2rem;">
            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-primary);">Worship & Rituals</h2>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary);">Sacred Sites</h3>
            <p>Zeus's most famous oracle was at Dodona in Epirus, where priestesses interpreted the rustling of sacred oak leaves. The Olympic sanctuary at Olympia housed his massive gold and ivory statue by Phidias (one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World) and hosted the Olympic Games every four years in his honor. Major temples also stood at Athens, Sparta, and throughout the Greek world. Mount Olympus itself, though rarely visited by mortals, was considered his primary dwelling.</p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1rem;">Festivals</h3>
            <ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 2rem;">
                <li><strong>Olympic Games:</strong> Held every four years at Olympia beginning in 776 BCE, these pan-Hellenic athletic contests honored Zeus. Athletes competed for olive wreaths and eternal glory, and a sacred truce halted all wars during the games.</li>
                <li><strong>Diasia:</strong> Athenian festival in early spring featuring sacrifices of sheep and pigs. Celebrated Zeus Meilichios (Zeus the Gentle), seeking his benevolence for the coming agricultural season.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1rem;">Offerings</h3>
            <p>Zeus received the grandest sacrifices: hecatombs (literally "hundred oxen," though the number was often symbolic) of cattle and bulls, their fat and bones burned on altars while choice portions were consumed by worshippers in communal feasts. White animals were preferred. Libations of wine accompanied prayers. Oaths were sworn in Zeus's name with dire consequences for oath-breakers. Suppliant branches were laid at his altars when seeking protection or justice.</p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1rem;">Prayers & Invocations</h3>
            <p>Zeus was invoked as witness to oaths, protector of guests (Zeus Xenios), guardian of the city (Zeus Polieus), and upholder of justice. Prayers typically began with his epithets acknowledging his specific aspect being petitioned. Supplicants would raise hands skyward when praying to Zeus, as he dwells in the heavens. The proper formula included reminding Zeus of past offerings and service, then stating the request.</p>

            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-primary);">Practical Applications</h2>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary);">Character Archetypes</h3>
            <p>Characters embodying Zeus's energy might display:</p>
            <ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>Authority & Leadership:</strong> Natural rulers who command respect, make difficult decisions, and bear the burden of sovereignty</li>
                <li><strong>Justice & Law:</strong> Those who uphold order, judge between parties, enforce agreements, and punish transgressors</li>
                <li><strong>Power & Responsibility:</strong> Wielders of great power who must balance personal desires against cosmic duty, sometimes failing spectacularly</li>
                <li><strong>Transformation & Adaptability:</strong> Shape-shifters who approach problems from multiple angles, wearing different faces for different audiences</li>
                <li><strong>Paternal Protection:</strong> Fierce protectors of their people/domain who can be both nurturing and terrifyingly wrathful</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1rem;">Game Design Applications</h3>
            <p>Zeus provides rich material for game mechanics and narrative:</p>
            <ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>Divine Favor System:</strong> Players gain or lose Zeus's favor based on adherence to oaths, treatment of guests, and demonstrations of justice. High favor grants lightning-based powers or divine aid; low favor brings divine punishment.</li>
                <li><strong>Transformation Mechanics:</strong> Ability to shift forms for infiltration, seduction, or deception, reflecting Zeus's many disguises.</li>
                <li><strong>Weather/Lightning Powers:</strong> Control over storms, rain, and particularly lightning strikes as both weapon and judgment.</li>
                <li><strong>Oath & Agreement Systems:</strong> Mechanically enforced promises where breaking an oath triggers automatic divine retribution.</li>
                <li><strong>Kingship/Territory Management:</strong> Ruling domains, making laws, judging disputes, and managing alliances.</li>
                <li><strong>Epic Boss Encounters:</strong> Zeus as final arbiter or ultimate challenge, wielding thunderbolts and shape-shifting through combat phases.</li>
            </ul>
