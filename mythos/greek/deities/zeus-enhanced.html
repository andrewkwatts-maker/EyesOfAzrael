            content: `## The Supreme Olympian

Zeus stands as the mightiest of the Olympian gods, wielding absolute power over sky, weather, and cosmic order. Born to the Titans Kronos and Rhea, he escaped his father's cannibalistic paranoia and led the younger gods in the great war against the Titans—the Titanomachy—establishing a new divine order.

### Divine Authority

As king of the gods, Zeus governs from Mount Olympus, dispensing justice and maintaining cosmic balance. His thunderbolt, forged by the Cyclopes, serves as both weapon and symbol of his supreme authority. No deity challenges his rule, though many seek to influence his decisions.

### Complex Character

Zeus embodies the paradoxes of divine power. Though upholder of justice and protector of guests (xenia), he himself frequently violates these principles. His numerous affairs with goddesses and mortal women demonstrate both his virility and his disregard for marriage vows, creating ongoing conflict with his wife Hera.`,
