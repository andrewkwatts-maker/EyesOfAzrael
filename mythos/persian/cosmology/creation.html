            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-primary);">The Beginning: Infinite Light and Infinite Darkness</h2>
            <p>
                In the beginning, there existed only two uncreated spiritual entities dwelling in separate realms:
                <strong>Ahura Mazda</strong> (the Wise Lord) in infinite light above, and <strong>Angra Mainyu</strong>
                (the Destructive Spirit) in infinite darkness below. Between them lay the Void - an empty space of
                nothingness.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                Ahura Mazda possessed omniscience, knowing all past, present, and future. He knew that Angra Mainyu
                existed in the darkness below and foresaw the cosmic conflict to come. Angra Mainyu, dwelling in
                ignorance and stupidity, did not know of Ahura Mazda's existence until much later.
        </section>

        <section style="margin-top: 2rem;">
            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-primary);">The First Choice: Good vs. Evil</h2>
            <p>
                Eventually, Angra Mainyu rose from the darkness and discovered Ahura Mazda's luminous creation in the
                spiritual realm. Filled with envy and destructive rage, he rushed toward it to destroy it.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                Ahura Mazda, seeing him approach, offered a choice: <em>"Join with me in creating good, and I will
                make you immortal and free from decay."</em> But Angra Mainyu refused, declaring: <em>"I will not
                agree with you, I will not praise your creation. I will destroy your creation forever and ever. I will
                force all your creatures to hate you and love me!"</em>
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                This moment established the fundamental ethical dualism of existence: two spirits who <strong>chose</strong>
                their paths. Ahura Mazda chose truth, light, and life. Angra Mainyu chose falsehood, darkness, and
                destruction. From this choice flows all subsequent cosmic history.

                <p>
                    Ahura Mazda first created the world in spiritual/ideal form (menog state). This was a perfect,
                    non-material existence where all creation existed as pure essence without physical form. During
                    this period, Angra Mainyu remained ignorant of the good creation.

            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-primary);">The Six Stages of Material Creation</h2>

            <div class="creation-stage">
                <h3>1. 🔵 Sky (Asman) - Protected by Khshathra Vairya</h3>
                <p>
                    First, Ahura Mazda created the sky as a hard, stone-like (or metal-like) sphere enclosing the
                    entire cosmos. This luminous shell contained the world and separated the good creation from the
                    outer darkness where Angra Mainyu dwelt. The sky was made of a substance like crystal or metal,
                    bright and protective.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="creation-stage">
                <h3>2. 💧 Water (Ab) - Protected by Haurvatat</h3>
                <p>
                    Second, Ahura Mazda created water, which filled the lower half of the cosmic sphere. These
                    primordial waters were pure, sweet, and life-giving. From these waters would flow all rivers,
                    lakes, and seas. The yazata Anahita governs these waters, ensuring their purity and fertility.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="creation-stage">
                <h3>3. 🌍 Earth (Zam) - Protected by Spenta Armaiti</h3>
                <p>
                    Third, Ahura Mazda created the earth, round and flat like a disk, floating in the middle of the
                    cosmic waters. At the center rose Mount Hara (Hara Berezaiti), the great world-mountain from
                    which all other mountains and lands spread outward. The earth was perfectly smooth, without valleys
                    or peaks (these came later through Angra Mainyu's assault).
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="creation-stage">
                <h3>4. 🌱 Plants (Urvar) - Protected by Ameretat</h3>
                <p>
                    Fourth, Ahura Mazda created the primordial plant, the Tree of All Seeds (also called the Tree of
                    All Healing), which grew at the center of the world in the cosmic waters. From this single perfect
                    plant came the seeds of all other plants. Every beneficial plant, tree, grain, and flower descended
                    from this original creation.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="creation-stage">
                <h3>5. 🐂 Animals (Goshorun) - Protected by Vohu Manah</h3>
                <p>
                    Fifth, Ahura Mazda created the Primordial Bull (Gav-i Evdad or Goshorun), the archetypal animal
                    from which all beneficial animals descended. This bull was white, luminous, and perfect. It grazed
                    on the banks of the cosmic river, peaceful and immortal. From its essence would come all cattle,
                    horses, and domesticated animals.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="creation-stage">
                <h3>6. 👤 Humanity (Mardumih) - Protected by Asha Vahishta</h3>
                <p>
                    Sixth and finally, Ahura Mazda created the first human being, Gayomart (also called Gayomard),
                    the Primordial Man. He was created as a single androgynous being, shining like the sun, immortal,
                    and perfect. Gayomart was placed at the center of the world, near Mount Hara, to be the ancestor
                    of all humanity and the guardian of creation.

            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-primary);">⚔️ The Assault of Angra Mainyu</h2>
            <p>
                At the end of the 6,000th year, Angra Mainyu discovered the material creation in all its beauty and
                perfection. Unable to create anything himself (for evil is inherently sterile), he could only corrupt
                and destroy. He launched a devastating assault on the good creation:
            </p>

            <div class="creation-stage" style="border-left-color: #8B0000;">
                <h3>The Introduction of Evil</h3>
                <ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                    <li><strong>The Sky:</strong> Angra Mainyu pierced the sky, creating a hole through which he entered
                        the material world. This breach allowed evil to infiltrate creation.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Waters:</strong> He poisoned the waters, making some salty and bitter, introducing
                        decay and corruption.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Earth:</strong> He struck the earth, creating mountains, valleys, deserts, and
                        wastelands. What was smooth became rough; what was perfect became flawed.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Plants:</strong> He withered plants, introduced thorns, poisonous herbs, and disease.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Primordial Bull:</strong> Angra Mainyu and his demon Az (Concupiscence) struck down
                        Goshorun, introducing death into the world. From the dying bull's seed came all animal species,
                        but now mortal and subject to suffering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gayomart:</strong> Angra Mainyu poisoned Gayomart with death. The Primordial Man lived
                        thirty years more, then died. From his seed, buried in the earth, grew the first human couple:
                        Mashya and Mashyana (male and female), who became the ancestors of all humanity - now mortal,
                        now vulnerable to evil.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                This assault began the "Period of Mixture" (Gumezishn), where good and evil became intertwined in the
                material world. No longer purely perfect, creation became a battlefield. However, Ahura Mazda had
                foreseen this and had prepared defenses. The Amesha Spentas, Yazatas, and the righteous Fravashis
                immediately began fighting back, containing evil and protecting what remained good.

            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-primary);">🔥 The Role of Fire in Creation</h2>
            <p>
                Fire (Atar) is called the "son of Ahura Mazda" and was present at creation as the active principle
                of transformation and purification. Fire represents the divine presence in the material world and
                serves as the link between spiritual and physical realms. Unlike other elements, fire cannot be
                corrupted by Angra Mainyu - it remains eternally pure.
        </section>

        <section style="margin-top: 2rem;">
            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-primary);">The Purpose of Creation</h2>
            <p>
                Why did Ahura Mazda create the material world, knowing it would be attacked by evil? According to
                Zoroastrian theology, the material creation serves as a trap for Angra Mainyu. By entering the
                material world to corrupt it, Angra Mainyu became bound to it - and thus can be defeated within it.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                At the end of time (Frashokereti - the Final Renovation), the world will be purified by molten metal,
                evil will be utterly destroyed, the dead will be resurrected, and creation will return to its original
                perfect state - but now eternally secure, with evil annihilated forever. The material world will merge
                with the spiritual, becoming an eternal paradise.

            <p>
                Zoroastrian creation shares themes with other traditions while maintaining unique characteristics:
            </p>
            <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 1rem;">
                <li><strong>Jewish (Genesis):</strong> Both describe orderly creation in stages, with humans created
                    last. However, Zoroastrianism uniquely includes the assault of evil after creation.</li>
                <li><strong>Hindu (Purusha/Hiranyagarbha):</strong> Similar concept of primordial sacrifice (the Bull)
                    giving rise to multiplicity, but Zoroastrianism rejects cyclical time for linear eschatology.</li>
                <li><strong>Greek (Chaos to Cosmos):</strong> Both move from disorder to order, but Zoroastrianism
                    emphasizes active evil opposition rather than primordial chaos.</li>
                <li><strong>Norse (Ymir's Body):</strong> Both use sacrifice of primordial being to create world, but
                    Zoroastrian sacrifice is evil's doing, not the creator's plan.</li>
