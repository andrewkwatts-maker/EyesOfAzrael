            <p>
                Persian mythology includes both historical prophets who received divine revelation and legendary heroes
                whose stories are preserved in the great epic poetry of Iran, especially the Shahnameh (Book of Kings)
                by Ferdowsi. These figures embody the eternal struggle between good and evil, demonstrating the power
                of righteousness, courage, and wisdom.

                    Zarathustra reformed ancient Iranian religion, emphasizing ethical monotheism, free will, and the
                    cosmic struggle between truth and falsehood.
