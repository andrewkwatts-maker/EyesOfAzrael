            <p class="subtitle" style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin: 0.5rem 0;">The Prophet, Revealer of Truth</p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-top: 1rem;">The founding prophet of Zoroastrianism, who received divine revelation from <a href="../deities/ahura-mazda.html" class="inline-search-link">Ahura Mazda</a> and established the religion of truth. Zoroaster (Avestan: Zarathustra; Persian: Zartosht) is revered as humanity's greatest teacher, the one who revealed the cosmic conflict between <a href="../cosmology/asha.html" class="inline-search-link">Asha</a> and <a href="../cosmology/druj.html" class="inline-search-link">Druj</a>, and taught the <a href="../cosmology/threefold-path.html" class="inline-search-link">Threefold Path</a> of righteousness.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="golden-box">
            <strong>Historical vs. Legendary:</strong> Scholars debate whether Zoroaster lived c. 1500-1000 BCE (traditional Zoroastrian dating) or c. 628-551 BCE (some modern estimates). The Gathas - his direct teachings - are among the oldest religious texts in an Indo-European language. While his historicity is debated, his influence on human civilization is undeniable.

            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-primary);">Biography & Life</h2>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary);">Early Life & Birth</h3>
            <p>Zoroaster was born in northeastern Iran (possibly Airyana Vaejah, the legendary Aryan homeland). His birth was accompanied by miraculous signs:</p>
            <ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>Joyous Laughter:</strong> Instead of crying at birth, he laughed - the only infant in history to do so</li>
                <li><strong>Heavenly Light:</strong> A radiant glow surrounded him</li>
                <li><strong>Protected by Divine Forces:</strong> Attempts by evil priests to kill the infant were thwarted</li>
                <li><strong>Fravashi's Glory:</strong> His divine spirit (fravashi) was visible to the spiritually aware</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">The Seeking Years (Age 20-30)</h3>
            <p>Zoroaster served as a priest (zaotar) in the old polytheistic religion but became increasingly troubled by:</p>
            <ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li>Animal sacrifice and ritualistic violence</li>
                <li>The worship of daevas (demons) as gods</li>
                <li>Oppression of the weak by warrior clans</li>
                <li>Lack of ethical foundation in religious practice</li>
                <li>Cosmic injustice and suffering</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">He withdrew from society, seeking answers through meditation and wandering. For ten years, he pondered the fundamental questions of existence, justice, and divine truth.</p>

            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-primary);">The Divine Revelation</h2>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary);">The First Vision (Age 30)</h3>
            <p>At age 30, while drawing water from the river Daitya for a sacred ceremony, Zoroaster experienced his transformative vision:</p>

            <div class="golden-box">
                <ul style="margin: 0; line-height: 1.8;">
                    <li>A shining figure appeared - <a href="../deities/amesha-spentas.html#vohu-manah" class="inline-search-link">Vohu Manah</a> (Good Mind), the first Amesha Spenta</li>
                    <li>Vohu Manah asked: "Who are you? To whom do you belong?"</li>
                    <li>Zoroaster answered: "I am Zarathustra, the greatest foe of Druj and the strongest support of Asha"</li>
                    <li>Vohu Manah led him to the assembly of <a href="../deities/ahura-mazda.html" class="inline-search-link">Ahura Mazda</a> and the <a href="../deities/amesha-spentas.html" class="inline-search-link">Amesha Spentas</a></li>
                    <li>In the divine presence, Zoroaster could not see his own shadow - so bright was the divine light</li>
                    <li>Ahura Mazda revealed fundamental truths about existence, good and evil, and humanity's role</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">The Seven Visions</h3>
            <p>Over the following years, Zoroaster received seven major revelations, each from one of the Amesha Spentas:</p>
            <ol style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>Vohu Manah (Good Mind):</strong> The power of righteous thought</li>
                <li><strong>Asha Vahishta (Best Truth):</strong> The nature of cosmic order and righteousness</li>
                <li><strong>Khshathra Vairya (Desirable Dominion):</strong> Divine sovereignty and just rule</li>
                <li><strong>Spenta Armaiti (Holy Devotion):</strong> Loving devotion and humility</li>
                <li><strong>Haurvatat (Wholeness):</strong> Spiritual and physical perfection</li>
                <li><strong>Ameretat (Immortality):</strong> Eternal life and victory over death</li>
                <li><strong>Ahura Mazda:</strong> The supreme wisdom and final instructions</li>

            <p>After receiving revelation, Zoroaster began preaching his revolutionary message:</p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary);">Conversion of the King (Age 42)</h3>
            <p>After twelve years of rejection, Zoroaster reached the court of King Vishtaspa (Hystaspes) in Bactria. The king initially refused the new religion, but three events changed his mind:</p>

            <ol style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>The Healing:</strong> Zoroaster healed Vishtaspa's favorite horse, which had been paralyzed by evil magic</li>
                <li><strong>The Vision:</strong> Vishtaspa was granted a vision of heaven and the rewards of following Asha</li>
                <li><strong>The Test:</strong> Court magicians tried to defeat Zoroaster in debate and magical contest, but failed spectacularly</li>
            </ol>

            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">King Vishtaspa converted and declared Zoroastrianism the state religion. This was the turning point that ensured the religion's survival and spread.</p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">The Sacred Wars</h3>
            <p>Zoroaster's success triggered violent opposition. The "Sacred Wars" erupted as neighboring kingdoms, defending the old daeva-worship, attacked Vishtaspa's realm. These conflicts were seen as cosmic battles between Asha and Druj made manifest.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Zoroaster's Death:</strong> Tradition holds that Zoroaster was martyred at age 77 during one of these wars. While praying in a fire temple, he was slain by a Turanian priest of the old religion. His last words were prayers to Ahura Mazda. Yet his death was seen not as defeat but as final proof of his devotion - he died as he lived, in service to Asha.</p>
