                is the fundamental and most important concept in Islam - the absolute, uncompromising belief in the Oneness of
                <a href="../deities/allah.html" class="inline-search-link">Allah</a>. It is not merely monotheism, but the affirmation
                that Allah alone is the Creator, Sustainer, and Sovereign, with no partners, equals, or intermediaries in His essence,
                attributes, or right to worship.

                <h4>Oneness of Lordship</h4>
                <p>
                    The belief that Allah alone is the <a href="#" class="inline-search-link" data-search-term="Rabb" onclick="performCodexSearch(event, 'Rabb')">Rabb</a>
                    (Lord) - the Creator, Sustainer, Provider, and Controller of all existence. He alone gives life and death, provides sustenance,
                    and governs the universe. Nothing happens except by His will and decree (<a href="qadar.html" class="inline-search-link">Qadar</a>).

                    <li><strong>Provider:</strong> All provision comes from Him alone</li>

                <h4>Oneness of Worship</h4>
                <p>
                    Also called Tawhid al-'Ibadah, this is the belief that Allah alone deserves worship. All acts of worship - prayer, supplication,
                    sacrifice, vows, fear, hope, love, reliance - must be directed exclusively to Allah. This is the essence of
                    <a href="#" class="inline-search-link" data-search-term="La ilaha illa Allah" onclick="performCodexSearch(event, 'La ilaha illa Allah')">La ilaha illa Allah</a>
                    (There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah).

                <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                    <li><strong>Exclusive Worship:</strong> All worship directed solely to Allah</li>
                    <li><strong>No Intermediaries:</strong> Direct relationship between servant and Creator</li>
                    <li><strong>Rejection of Shirk:</strong> No associating partners with Allah in worship</li>
                    <li><strong>Sincere Devotion:</strong> Actions done purely for Allah's sake</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                    This category is where most people fall into <a href="#" class="inline-search-link" data-search-term="Shirk" onclick="performCodexSearch(event, 'Shirk')">shirk</a>
                    (associating partners with Allah). Even those who believe in Allah as Creator may worship others alongside Him,
                    seek help from the dead, or place intermediaries between themselves and Allah.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-box">
                <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 0;">3. Tawhid al-Asma was-Sifat (توحيد الأسماء والصفات)</h3>
                <h4>Oneness of Names and Attributes</h4>
                <p>
                    The belief that Allah's <a href="../deities/99-names.html" class="inline-search-link">names and attributes</a>
                    are unique to Him alone. We affirm for Allah what He has affirmed for Himself in the Quran and authentic Hadith,
                    without distorting (tahreef), denying (ta'til), asking how (takyeef), or likening Him to creation (tamtheel).
                </p>
                <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                    <li><strong>Affirmation:</strong> Accept Allah's attributes as they are revealed</li>
                    <li><strong>No Comparison:</strong> "There is nothing like unto Him" (42:11)</li>
                    <li><strong>No Denial:</strong> Don't negate what Allah affirmed</li>
                    <li><strong>No Distortion:</strong> Don't twist meanings to fit human understanding</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                    Examples include Allah's knowledge (encompassing all things), power (over all things), mercy, wisdom, hearing, seeing,
                    and other perfect attributes that belong to Him in a manner befitting His majesty.

            <p>
                <a href="#" class="inline-search-link" data-search-term="Shirk" onclick="performCodexSearch(event, 'Shirk')">Shirk</a>
                is associating partners with Allah in any form. It is the only unforgivable sin if one dies without repenting from it.
                The Quran states: "Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills" (4:48).
            </p>
            <p>
                Forms of major shirk include:
            </p>
            <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>Worship of idols, statues, or images</strong> - As the Quraysh did with their idols</li>
                <li><strong>Praying to or seeking help from the dead</strong> - Including righteous people or prophets</li>
                <li><strong>Belief in multiple gods</strong> - Polytheism in any form</li>
                <li><strong>Attributing divine knowledge to others</strong> - Fortune-telling, astrology, claiming to know the unseen</li>
                <li><strong>Making lawful what Allah made unlawful</strong> - Or vice versa, claiming legislative authority that belongs to Allah alone</li>
                <li><strong>Loving something equal to or more than Allah</strong> - When this love leads to disobedience of Allah</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">Minor Shirk (Shirk al-Asghar)</h3>
            <p>
                Minor shirk includes hidden shirk (showing off in worship), swearing by other than Allah, and attributing blessings or harm
                to created things rather than recognizing Allah as the ultimate source. While not removing one from Islam, it diminishes
                Tawhid and can lead to major shirk if left unchecked.

            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-primary);">Manifestations of Tawhid</h2>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary);">In Belief (Aqidah)</h3>
            <p>
                Tawhid manifests in the heart through firm conviction that Allah alone is worthy of worship, that He has no partners,
                and that all power, provision, and affairs belong to Him. This produces certainty (<a href="#" class="inline-search-link" data-search-term="Yaqeen" onclick="performCodexSearch(event, 'Yaqeen')">yaqeen</a>),
                trust (<a href="#" class="inline-search-link" data-search-term="Tawakkul" onclick="performCodexSearch(event, 'Tawakkul')">tawakkul</a>),
                and proper fear and hope directed only toward Allah.
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">In Worship (Ibadah)</h3>
            <p>
                All acts of worship - <a href="../rituals/salat.html" class="inline-search-link">prayer</a>,
                charity, fasting, pilgrimage,
                supplication, sacrifice - must be performed exclusively for Allah's sake, without showing off or seeking human approval.
                The Prophet said: "Actions are judged by intentions."
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">In Daily Life (Mu'amalat)</h3>
            <p>
                Tawhid extends to every aspect of life. Muslims recognize <a href="../deities/allah.html" class="inline-search-link">Allah</a> as the source of all provision, the giver of children,
                health, and success. They seek His help in all matters, make decisions according to His guidance, and acknowledge His wisdom
                in both blessing and trial. This produces contentment with Allah's decree.
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">In Governance (Hakimiyyah)</h3>
            <p>
                True Tawhid recognizes Allah's exclusive right to legislate. Muslims accept the Quran
                and Sunnah as the ultimate source of law and morality.
                While human reasoning and consultation (shura) are valued, they operate within the framework of divine revelation.

            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-primary);">The Fruits of Tawhid</h2>
            <p>
                Sincere and complete Tawhid produces numerous spiritual and psychological benefits:
            </p>
            <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>Liberation:</strong> Freedom from servitude to creation and dependency on anyone but Allah</li>
                <li><strong>Inner Peace:</strong> Tranquility knowing all affairs are in the hands of the All-Wise</li>
                <li><strong>Courage:</strong> Fearlessness except of Allah, enabling moral courage and principled stands</li>
                <li><strong>Humility:</strong> Recognition of human weakness and complete dependence on Allah</li>
                <li><strong>Gratitude:</strong> Acknowledging all blessings come from Allah alone</li>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Clear understanding of life's meaning and ultimate accountability</li>
                <li><strong>Equality:</strong> Recognition that all humans are equal before Allah, distinguished only by piety</li>
                <li><strong>Resilience:</strong> Patience in adversity, knowing trials come from the All-Merciful</li>
            </ul>

                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin: 0;">
                    <strong>The Greatest Verse on Tawhid:</strong> "Say: He is Allah, the One. Allah, the Eternal Refuge. He neither begets nor is born,
                    nor is there to Him any equivalent." (Quran 112:1-4)
                </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0;">
                    This brief chapter, Surah Al-Ikhlas, encapsulates pure Tawhid:
                    Allah's absolute oneness, His eternal self-sufficiency, His transcendence beyond biological generation, and His absolute uniqueness.
                    The Prophet <a href="../deities/muhammad.html" class="inline-search-link">Muhammad</a> said it equals one-third of the Quran because it summarizes the fundamental belief.

            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-primary);">Connections to Islamic Cosmology</h2>
            <p>
                Tawhid is the cornerstone of Islamic cosmology. It shapes the understanding of <a href="creation.html" class="inline-search-link">creation</a>,
                where <a href="../deities/allah.html" class="inline-search-link">Allah</a> alone brought everything into existence.
                It informs the concept of the <a href="afterlife.html" class="inline-search-link">afterlife</a>, where those who upheld Tawhid enter Paradise.
                The <a href="../creatures/jinn.html" class="inline-search-link">jinn</a> and angels like <a href="../deities/jibreel.html" class="inline-search-link">Jibreel</a>
                were all created to worship the One God. Prophets like <a href="../heroes/ibrahim.html" class="inline-search-link">Ibrahim</a> and
                <a href="../heroes/musa.html" class="inline-search-link">Musa</a> dedicated their lives to calling people to Tawhid,
                and <a href="../rituals/salat.html" class="inline-search-link">Salat</a> (prayer) reaffirms this oneness five times daily.
