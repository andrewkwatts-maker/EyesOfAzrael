            <h2>From Death to Eternity</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; max-width: 800px; margin: 1rem auto;">
                Islamic eschatology presents a comprehensive journey of the soul: from the moment of death through
                Barzakh (the intermediate realm), resurrection on the Day of Judgment, the crossing of the Sirat bridge,
                and finally eternal dwelling in Jannah (Paradise) or Jahannam (Hell) based on faith and deeds.
            </p>
        </div>

        <section>
            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-primary);">Overview of the Journey</h2>
            <p>
                Every soul will experience death and face accountability. The Islamic afterlife journey consists
                of distinct stages, each with specific characteristics and purposes. Unlike concepts of reincarnation,
                Islamic theology teaches a one-directional journey: life → death → intermediate realm → resurrection
                → judgment → eternal destination.

                <strong>Certainty of Death:</strong><br>
                "Every soul will taste death. Then to Us you will be returned." - <em>Quran 29:57</em><br><br>
                "Wherever you may be, death will overtake you, even if you should be within towers of lofty construction."

            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-primary);">The Seven Stages of the Afterlife Journey</h2>

            <div class="journey-stage">
                <div class="stage-number">Stage 1: The Moment of Death (Al-Mawt)</div>
                <p><strong>The Angel of Death - Azrael (Izrail)</strong></p>
                <p>
                    When a person's appointed time arrives, Azrael comes to extract the soul. The experience differs
                    drastically between believers and disbelievers:
                </p>
                <ul style="margin: 0.75rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                    <li><strong>For the Righteous:</strong> Angels of mercy with faces like the sun bring shrouds
                    from Paradise and fragrant scents. The soul is drawn out gently "like water from a waterskin."
                    Angels greet: "O good soul, come out to forgiveness and pleasure from Allah."</li>
                    <li><strong>For the Wicked:</strong> Angels of punishment with dark faces bring coarse shrouds
                    from Hell. The soul is torn out painfully "like thorns being dragged through wool."
                    Angels say: "O evil soul, come out to the wrath of Allah."</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem;">
                    At death, the soul sees glimpses of its final destination. The dying person sees what others
                    present cannot: angels, their future dwelling, and the reality of the unseen realm.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="journey-stage">
                <div class="stage-number">Stage 2: Journey to the Heavens</div>
                <p><strong>Ascension Through Gates</strong></p>
                <p>
                    After extraction, the righteous soul is taken upward through the heavens. At each heaven's gate,
                    angels ask: "Who is this?" Upon identification as a righteous believer, gates open with welcome:
                    "A righteous soul from Earth has come—may Allah bless it!" The soul ascends to the seventh heaven.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The wicked soul attempts to ascend but is rejected. Gates remain closed. Angels say: "Return to
                    Earth; we will not open the gates of heaven for you." The soul is cast back down.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="journey-stage">
                <div class="stage-number">Stage 3: The Grave (Al-Qabr)</div>
                <p><strong>First Resting Place</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Whether buried, cremated, or lost at sea, every soul experiences the reality of the grave—a
                    spiritual state if not a physical one. The grave is either "a garden from the gardens of Paradise"
                    or "a pit from the pits of Hell."
                </p>

                <h4 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1rem;">The Trial of the Grave (Su'al al-Qabr)</h4>
                <p>
                    Two angels—Munkar and Nakir—appear to question every deceased person:
                </p>
                <ol style="margin: 0.75rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                    <li><strong>"Who is your Lord?"</strong> (Man rabbuka?)</li>
                    <li><strong>"What is your religion?"</strong> (Ma dinuka?)</li>
                    <li><strong>"What do you say about this man [Muhammad]?"</strong> (Ma taqulu fi hadha ar-rajul?)</li>
                </ol>

                <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem;"><strong>The Believer's Response:</strong></p>
                <ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 2rem;">
                    <li>"Allah is my Lord" (Rabbiya Allah)</li>
                    <li>"Islam is my religion" (Dini al-Islam)</li>
                    <li>"Muhammad is Allah's messenger" (Muhammadun rasul Allah)</li>
                </ul>

                <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem;">
                    A voice proclaims: "My servant has spoken truth!" The grave expands to vast dimensions,
                    a window to Paradise opens, and the righteous soul rests in peace until resurrection.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem;"><strong>The Disbeliever's Confusion:</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Unable to answer, they stammer: "I don't know... I heard people saying something..."
                    The grave constricts until ribs interlock. A window to Hell opens, bringing heat and torment.
                    This is the beginning of punishment.
                </p>
            </div>

                <p><strong>The Wait Between Death and Resurrection</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Barzakh (البرزخ - "the barrier") is the dimension between earthly life and resurrection.
                    Time in Barzakh varies: it could be years, centuries, or millennia, but feels different
                    than earthly time. The soul remains in a state between corporeality and pure spirit.
                </p>

                <h4 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1rem;">Characteristics of Barzakh:</h4>
                <ul style="margin: 0.75rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                    <li><strong>Awareness:</strong> Souls are conscious and aware of their state</li>
                    <li><strong>Limited Connection:</strong> Can hear living visitors to graves but cannot respond</li>
                    <li><strong>Degree of Judgment:</strong> Taste of final destination (foretaste of Paradise or Hell)</li>
                    <li><strong>No Return:</strong> Cannot come back to earthly life to change deeds</li>
                    <li><strong>Visitation:</strong> Righteous souls may visit each other and their living relatives in dreams</li>
                    <li><strong>Martyrs' Exception:</strong> Souls of martyrs (shaheed) given special status, dwelling in the
                    crops of green birds that roam Paradise freely</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Islamic tradition teaches that certain deeds of the living can benefit the deceased:
                </p>
                <ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 2rem;">
                    <li>Sincere supplications (du'a) from children and believers</li>
                    <li>Charity (sadaqah jariyah) given on their behalf</li>
                    <li>Knowledge they taught that continues to benefit people</li>
                    <li>Righteous children who pray for them</li>

                <h4 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary);">The Signs and the Trumpet</h4>
                <p>
                    After signs of the end times appear (including the return of Isa/Jesus, appearance of the Dajjal/Antichrist,
                    and rising of the sun from the west), the angel Israfil will blow the trumpet (Sur):
                </p>

                <ul style="margin: 0.75rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                    <li><strong>First Blast:</strong> All living beings die; creation ceases; the universe collapses.
                    "Everything will perish except His Face." (Quran 28:88)</li>
                    <li><strong>Interval:</strong> Complete annihilation—only Allah remains</li>
                    <li><strong>Second Blast:</strong> All souls are resurrected and returned to recreated bodies.
                    Bodies emerge from graves, reconstituted from the coccyx bone (عَجْب الذَّنَب), which never decays.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1rem;">The Great Gathering (Al-Hashr)</h4>
                <p>
                    All of humanity—from Adam to the last person—stands on a vast plain. The earth becomes flat,
                    white like pure silver. Every human, jinn, and animal gathers. The sun draws near, causing intense
                    heat and distress proportional to one's sins. Some will be in shade under Allah's throne;
                    others will sweat according to their deeds—some to ankles, some to knees, some drowning in their own sweat.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem;">
                    <strong>Duration:</strong> "A day the extent of which is fifty thousand years" (Quran 70:4)—though
                    believers will experience it as the time between Dhuhr and Asr prayers (a few hours).

                <p>
                    Each person receives their Book of Deeds:
                </p>
                <ul style="margin: 0.75rem 0 0 2rem;">
                    <li><strong>Right Hand:</strong> Righteous receive their book in the right hand, face glowing
                    with joy. "Here, read my record!" (Quran 69:19)</li>
                    <li><strong>Left Hand/Behind Back:</strong> Wicked receive their book in the left hand or from
                    behind. Face darkened with despair. "Oh, I wish I had not been given my record!" (Quran 69:25)</li>

                <h4 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1rem;">The Scale (Al-Mizan)</h4>
                <p>
                    Deeds are weighed on a massive scale:

                <ul style="margin: 0.75rem 0 0 2rem;">
                    <li><strong>Good Deeds:</strong> Placed on one side—light, weightful, bring salvation</li>
                    <li><strong>Bad Deeds:</strong> Placed on the other—heavy with consequence</li>
                    <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> If good outweighs bad → Paradise. If bad outweighs good → Hell
                    (though believers may face temporary punishment before Paradise)</li>
                </ul>

                    "And the weighing [of deeds] that Day will be the truth. So those whose scales are heavy—it is

                <p>
                    A bridge stretched over Jahannam (Hell), thinner than a hair and sharper than a sword.
                    Everyone must cross:
                </p>

                <ul style="margin: 0.75rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                    <li><strong>The Righteous:</strong> Cross with speed proportional to their faith and deeds—some
                    like lightning, some like wind, some like swift horses, some walking carefully but safely.
                    Their light (granted according to deeds) guides them.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hypocrites:</strong> Their light extinguishes midway. They fall into Hell.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Wicked:</strong> Fall immediately into the flames below.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hooks and Thorns:</strong> Line the bridge, grabbing those whose sins pull them down.</li>
                </ul>

                <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem;">
                    After successfully crossing, believers reach the gate of Paradise. But first, there is a final stop...

                <p>
                    Between Hell and Paradise is a place where believers settle accounts with each other—
                    retaliation for injustices done in the world. Only after all interpersonal wrongs are
                    rectified may they enter Paradise completely purified.

                <p>
                    Jahannam (جهنم - Hell) is the abode of punishment for those who rejected faith, committed grave
                    sins, and died unrepentant. However, Islamic theology distinguishes between eternal residents

                    <li><strong>Heat:</strong> Fire 70 times hotter than earthly fire. Inhabitants' skin constantly
                    regenerates so they continue feeling pain (Quran 4:56).</li>
                    <li><strong>Food:</strong> Zaqqum tree with fruit like devils' heads, boiling in bellies like
                    molten brass (Quran 44:43-46).</li>
                    <li><strong>Drink:</strong> Boiling water, pus, and hamim (scalding water) that tears intestines.</li>
                    <li><strong>Garments:</strong> Clothes of fire, tar, and pitch that stick to the skin.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chains and Shackles:</strong> Inhabitants bound and dragged through the fire.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vastness:</strong> Enormous beyond comprehension. "Has Hell been filled?"
                    It replies: "Are there any more?" (Quran 50:30)</li>
                    <li><strong>Nineteen Gatekeepers (Zabaniya):</strong> Led by Malik, stern angels who show
                    no mercy, executing divine justice without pity.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Death:</strong> Inhabitants wish for death/annihilation but it never comes.
                    They remain conscious, feeling every torment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Regret and Pleading:</strong> Constant pleas for relief, mercy, or a second chance—
                    all denied. "Today We will seal over their mouths" (Quran 36:65).</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 style="color: #FF4500; margin-top: 1.5rem;">Duration of Punishment</h4>
                <p><strong>For Disbelievers (Kuffar):</strong> Eternal, without end. "They will abide therein forever"
                (Quran 2:39).</p>

                <p><strong>For Sinful Believers:</strong> Temporary punishment proportional to sins, after which
                they are released to Paradise through intercession or divine mercy. No believer in Tawhid
                (oneness of Allah) remains in Hell forever.</p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary);">Divine Justice and Mercy</h3>
            <p>
                Islamic eschatology balances perfect justice with overwhelming mercy. No one is wronged—
                every punishment is deserved, every reward is earned or granted through Allah's grace.
                "Whoever brings a good deed will have ten times the like thereof, but whoever brings an
                evil deed will not be recompensed except the like thereof" (Quran 6:160).

            <ul style="margin: 0.75rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>Moral Accountability:</strong> Actions have eternal consequences, providing meaning
                to ethical choices</li>
                <li><strong>Ultimate Justice:</strong> Wrongs committed in this life are addressed in the next</li>
                <li><strong>Divine Wisdom:</strong> Life's trials and inequalities are temporary; ultimate fairness
                is guaranteed</li>
                <li><strong>Motivation:</strong> Hope in Paradise encourages righteousness; fear of Hell deters evil</li>
                <li><strong>Perspective:</strong> This life is brief preparation; the afterlife is the eternal reality</li>
