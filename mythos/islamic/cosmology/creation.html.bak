            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; max-width: 800px; margin: 1rem auto;">
                Islamic cosmology describes how Allah created the heavens and earth through His command "Kun!" (Be!).
                In six distinct periods or "days," all of existence came into being from absolute nothingness,
                culminating in the creation of humanity as khalifa (steward) of the Earth.

            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-primary);">Primordial State - Before Creation</h2>
            <p>
                Before creation, there was only Allah—eternal, self-sufficient, existing in absolute perfection.
                No time, no space, no matter, no void. Creation was an act of divine will, not necessity.
                Allah was not incomplete before creation; He created not from need but from His abundant generosity
                and will to manifest His attributes.
            </p>

                <strong>The Divine Command:</strong><br>
                "Indeed, His command when He intends a thing is only that He says to it, 'Be,' and it is."
                - <em>Quran 36:82</em><br><br>
                "He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth. When He decrees a matter, He only says to it,
                'Be,' and it is." - <em>Quran 2:117</em>

            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-primary);">The Six Days of Creation</h2>
            <p>
                The Quran mentions creation occurring in six "days" (ayyam), though Islamic scholars note these
                are not literal 24-hour periods but rather stages or epochs. "Indeed, a day with your Lord is
                like a thousand years of those which you count" (Quran 22:47).
            </p>

            <div class="creation-phase">
                <div class="phase-number">Days 1-2: Creation of the Earth</div>
                <p><strong>What was created:</strong> The physical Earth and its foundations</p>
                <p>"Say: Do you indeed disbelieve in He who created the earth in two days and attribute to Him equals?
                That is the Lord of the worlds." - <em>Quran 41:9</em></p>
                <p><strong>Process:</strong> Allah laid out the earth as a foundation for life. The earth was initially
                formless and void, prepared to receive mountains, valleys, and oceans.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="creation-phase">
                <div class="phase-number">Days 3-4: Sustenance and Mountains</div>
                <p><strong>What was created:</strong> Mountains, rivers, vegetation, and provision</p>
                <p>"And He placed on the earth firmly set mountains over its surface, and He blessed it and determined
                therein its sustenance in four days without distinction—for those who ask." - <em>Quran 41:10</em></p>
                <p><strong>Process:</strong> Mountains were set as anchors to stabilize the earth. Sustenance (rizq)
                was measured out and embedded in the earth—minerals, nutrients, potential for crops. This prepared
                the earth for life.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="creation-phase">
                <div class="phase-number">Days 5-6: Creation of the Heavens</div>
                <p><strong>What was created:</strong> The seven heavens, celestial bodies, angels</p>
                <p>"Then He directed Himself to the heaven while it was smoke and said to it and to the earth,
                'Come willingly or by compulsion.' They said, 'We have come willingly.' And He completed them
                as seven heavens within two days and inspired in each heaven its command. And We adorned the
                nearest heaven with lamps and as protection. That is the determination of the Exalted in Might,
                the Knowing." - <em>Quran 41:11-12</em></p>
                <p><strong>Process:</strong> The heavens were initially "smoke" (dukhan)—undifferentiated matter.
                Allah separated them into seven distinct layers, each with its own angels, function, and characteristics.
                Stars were placed in the lowest heaven as adornment and guidance.</p>

            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-primary);">The Seventh Day - Divine Rest?</h2>
            <p>
                Unlike the biblical tradition, Islamic theology explicitly rejects the notion that Allah rested
                after creation. The Quran states:
            </p>

            <div class="citation" style="background: rgba(0, 128, 0, 0.05); padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1rem 0;">
                "And We did certainly create the heavens and earth and what is between them in six days,
                <strong>and there touched Us no weariness</strong>." - <em>Quran 50:38</em>
            </div>

            <p>
                After completion, Allah "established Himself above the Throne" (istawa 'ala al-arsh), meaning He
                began exercising sovereignty and governance over creation. This is rulership, not rest from exhaustion.

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary);">Adam - The First Human</h3>
            <p>
                After creating the heavens and earth, Allah announced to the angels His intention to create a khalifa
                (steward/vicegerent) on Earth. The angels questioned this, wondering why Allah would create beings
                who would cause corruption and bloodshed. Allah responded: "Indeed, I know that which you do not know."
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">The Stages of Human Creation:</h3>

            <div class="creation-phase">
                <div class="phase-number">Stage 1: Clay from Earth</div>
                <p>Allah gathered clay from all parts of the earth—red, white, black, and brown—explaining humanity's
                diverse colors and natures. This clay was from the surface of the earth.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="creation-phase">
                <div class="phase-number">Stage 2: Molded Clay</div>
                <p>The clay was mixed with water and molded into human form. It remained in this state, hardening
                like pottery.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="creation-phase">
                <div class="phase-number">Stage 3: The Divine Breath</div>
                <p>Allah breathed into Adam from His Ruh (Spirit), and Adam became a living soul. This divine breath
                distinguishes humans from all other creatures, granting consciousness, will, and spiritual capacity.</p>
                <div class="citation" style="background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5); padding: 0.75rem; border-radius: 6px; margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                    "And [mention] when your Lord said to the angels, 'I will create a human being out of clay.
                    So when I have proportioned him and breathed into him of My [created] soul, then fall down
                    to him in prostration.'" - <em>Quran 38:71-72</em>

            <div class="creation-phase">
                <div class="phase-number">Stage 4: Teaching of Names</div>
                <p>Allah taught Adam the names of all things—knowledge that the angels did not possess. This demonstrated
                human capacity for knowledge, language, and abstract thought, justifying humanity's role as khalifa.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="creation-phase">
                <div class="phase-number">Stage 5: Angelic Prostration</div>
                <p>Allah commanded the angels to prostrate to Adam as a sign of honor and respect (not worship).
                All angels obeyed except Iblis (Satan), who refused out of arrogance, saying he was created from
                fire while Adam was from clay. This refusal led to Iblis's expulsion and eternal enmity with humanity.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">The Creation of Hawwa (Eve)</h3>
            <p>
                From Adam, Allah created his mate Hawwa (Eve), so he would not be alone. The Quran states:
                "O mankind, fear your Lord, who created you from one soul and created from it its mate"
                (Quran 4:1). She was created from Adam's rib, during his sleep in Paradise.

        <section style="margin-top: 2rem;">
            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-primary);">Paradise and the First Test</h2>
            <p>
                Adam and Hawwa were placed in Paradise (Jannah) with permission to enjoy all of it except one tree.
                Iblis, seeking revenge, whispered to them that the forbidden tree would grant immortality and kingship.
                They ate from it, not out of malice but forgetfulness and weakness. Upon realization, they immediately
                repented with sincere regret.
            </p>

            <p>
                Allah accepted their repentance—establishing the divine pattern of mercy preceding justice—and sent
                them to Earth as planned, now with knowledge of good and evil. Their stay in Paradise was always meant
                to be temporary; Earth was humanity's destined home from the beginning.

                <strong>The First Repentance:</strong><br>
                "They said, 'Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves, and if You do not forgive us and have mercy
                upon us, we will surely be among the losers.'" - <em>Quran 7:23</em>

            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-primary);">The Purpose of Creation</h2>
            <p>
                Islamic theology is clear about why creation exists:
            </p>

            <div class="citation" style="background: rgba(0, 128, 0, 0.05); padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1rem 0;">
                "And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me." - <em>Quran 51:56</em>
            </div>

            <p>
                "Worship" (ibadah) here means comprehensive devotion—not just ritual prayer, but living according
                to divine will in all aspects. Humanity serves as khalifa (steward) of Earth, tasked with maintaining
                balance, justice, and care for creation while recognizing Allah's sovereignty.
