            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-primary);">Nature and Characteristics</h2>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary);">Origin and Essence</h3>
            <p>
                Unlike humans created from clay and angels created from light,
                jinn were created from "marij min nar" - a smokeless flame of fire. This fiery origin grants them unique properties:
                they can move at tremendous speeds, change forms, and exist in dimensions beyond normal human perception. Their creation
                predates humanity, as mentioned in the Quran: "And the jinn We created before from scorching fire" (15:27).
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">Parallel Society</h3>
            <p>
                Jinn live in communities with social structures similar to humans. They marry, have children, eat, drink, and die.
                They have kings, leaders, and various tribes. Some jinn are Muslim, following <a href="../deities/muhammad.html" class="inline-search-link">Prophet Muhammad</a>
                and the Quran, while others are disbelievers.
                The Quran records jinn listening to Quranic recitation and accepting Islam (Surah 72).
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">Abilities and Limitations</h3>
            <p>
                Jinn possess abilities that exceed human capacity:
            </p>
            <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>Shapeshifting:</strong> Can take various forms including animals (often snakes or dogs)</li>
                <li><strong>Invisibility:</strong> Normally invisible to humans unless they choose to appear</li>
                <li><strong>Great Speed:</strong> Can travel vast distances quickly</li>
                <li><strong>Strength:</strong> Physically stronger than humans in many cases</li>
                <li><strong>Longevity:</strong> Live for centuries, possibly millennia</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                However, jinn have important limitations. They cannot know the Ghayb
                (unseen/future), despite common misconceptions. The Quran states that when Prophet Sulayman
                (Solomon) died, the jinn working for him didn't realize until much later, proving their ignorance of the unseen (34:14).
                They also cannot harm believers who maintain proper dhikr
                (remembrance of Allah) and protection.

            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-primary);">Types of Jinn</h2>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary);">1. Believing Jinn (Muslim Jinn)</h3>
            <p>
                These jinn have accepted <a href="../cosmology/tawhid.html" class="inline-search-link">Tawhid</a> (monotheism) and follow Islamic teachings.
                Surah Al-Jinn describes a group who heard the Quran being recited and immediately recognized its truth. They return to their people as warners,
                calling them to faith. Believing jinn will enter <a href="../cosmology/afterlife.html" class="inline-search-link">Jannah</a> (Paradise)
                just as righteous humans will.
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">2. Disbelieving Jinn</h3>
            <p>
                Like humans, many jinn reject faith and will face punishment in <a href="../cosmology/afterlife.html" class="inline-search-link">Jahannam</a> (Hell).
                The Quran states: "And We have certainly created for Hell many of the jinn and mankind" (7:179). These jinn may mislead humans,
                spread falsehood, and work against divine guidance.
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">3. Shayatin (Satanic Jinn)</h3>
            <p>
                Shayatin (plural of Shaytan) are rebellious jinn who actively work to mislead humanity.
                Led by Iblis, they whisper evil suggestions, beautify sin, and attempt to lead people
                away from Allah's path. The Quran warns: "Indeed, Satan is an enemy to you; so take him as an enemy" (35:6).
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">4. Ifrit</h3>
            <p>
                Ifrit (عفريت) are powerful and cunning jinn, often associated with the underworld
                and infernal regions. The Quran mentions an ifrit in the court of Prophet Sulayman,
                who offered to bring the Queen of Sheba's throne before the prophet could rise from his seat (27:39). They are known for strength and resourcefulness.
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">5. Marid</h3>
            <p>
                Marid are among the most powerful and rebellious types of jinn. They are often depicted as arrogant and difficult to control,
                even in the stories of Prophet Sulayman, who had dominion over jinn through Allah's permission.

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary);">Islamic Protective Measures</h3>
            <p>
                Islamic tradition provides numerous protections against harmful jinn:
            </p>
            <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>Ayat al-Kursi:</strong> Reciting Verse of the Throne (2:255) provides protection</li>
                <li><strong>Last Two Verses of Al-Baqarah:</strong> Powerful protection when recited before sleep</li>
                <li><strong>Surah Al-Falaq and An-Nas:</strong> The two protective chapters seeking refuge in Allah</li>
                <li><strong>Bismillah:</strong> Saying "In the name of Allah" when entering spaces, eating, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Regular Prayer:</strong> Maintaining the five daily <a href="../rituals/salat.html" class="inline-search-link">salat</a></li>
                <li><strong>Wudu (Ablution):</strong> Being in a state of ritual purity</li>
                <li><strong>Dhikr:</strong> Constant remembrance of Allah</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">Forbidden Practices</h3>
            <p>
                Islam strictly prohibits seeking help from jinn through sorcery,
                fortune-telling, or making pacts. Such practices are considered major sins, as they involve shirk (associating partners with Allah).
                The Quran condemns those who "seek refuge in men from the jinn" (72:6), as true refuge is only with Allah.

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary);">Sulayman's Kingdom</h3>
            <p>
                Prophet Sulayman (Solomon) was granted unique authority over jinn,
                wind, and animals as a miracle from <a href="../deities/allah.html" class="inline-search-link">Allah</a>. Jinn worked on his construction projects, created art, and served in his kingdom.
                The Quran describes them building palaces, making statues, and diving for pearls (34:12-13). When Sulayman died leaning on his staff,
                the jinn continued working, unaware of his death until termites ate through the staff and he collapsed - proving jinn don't know the unseen.
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">The Night of Jinn</h3>
            <p>
                During <a href="../deities/muhammad.html" class="inline-search-link">Prophet Muhammad</a>'s time, a delegation of jinn came to listen to him recite the Quran in a valley. This encounter is recorded
                in Surah Al-Jinn (72) and Surah Al-Ahqaf (46:29-32). The jinn returned to their people as warners, spreading the message of Islam
                among their kind. This demonstrates that Muhammad's message was universal, extending beyond humanity to all sentient beings.

        <section style="margin-top: 2rem;">
            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-primary);">Connections to Islamic Cosmology</h2>
            <p>
                The jinn occupy a unique place in Islamic cosmology. Created before humans from smokeless fire, they inhabit a parallel dimension
                and possess free will like humans. They are bound by the same divine law and will face judgment in the <a href="../cosmology/afterlife.html" class="inline-search-link">afterlife</a>.
                The jinn's interaction with <a href="../deities/muhammad.html" class="inline-search-link">Prophet Muhammad</a> and other prophets demonstrates
                the universal nature of <a href="../cosmology/tawhid.html" class="inline-search-link">Tawhid</a> (monotheism). They are mentioned alongside
                angels like <a href="../deities/jibreel.html" class="inline-search-link">Jibreel</a> in the hierarchy of creation, and their stories appear
                throughout the Quran in connection with prophets like <a href="../heroes/ibrahim.html" class="inline-search-link">Ibrahim</a> and
                <a href="../heroes/musa.html" class="inline-search-link">Musa</a>.
