## Content Quality Standards

All new pages must include:
- [x] Correct color scheme (#008000 primary, #00CED1 secondary)
- [x] Breadcrumb navigation
- [x] "Related Concepts" section with cross-tradition links
- [x] Primary source citations (Quran, Hadith, scholarly works)
- [x] "Practical Applications" section (character archetypes, game design)
- [x] Proper HTML structure matching existing templates
- [x] Respectful treatment of Islamic theology
- [x] No visual depictions of prophets or angels (warning boxes where appropriate)

---

## Template Files to Reference

When creating new pages, use these as templates:
- **Deity pages:** `deities/allah.html`, `deities/jibreel.html`
- **Prophet pages:** `deities/muhammad.html`
- **Cosmology pages:** `cosmology/creation.html`, `cosmology/afterlife.html`
- **Index pages:** `deities/index.html`, `cosmology/index.html`

---

## Cross-Tradition Links to Maintain

Each Islamic page should link to parallel concepts in:
- **Jewish/Kabbalah** (shared Abrahamic heritage)
- **Christian** (shared prophets, different theology)
- **Persian/Zoroastrian** (historical influence)
- **Greek, Egyptian, Norse** (comparative mythology)

---

## Special Notes

### Cultural Sensitivity
- No images of Muhammad, prophets, or angels
- Add warning boxes explaining Islamic tradition against visual depiction
- Use "peace be upon him" (PBUH) or (ﷺ) convention in text where appropriate
- Maintain theological accuracy - consult Quran and authentic Hadith

4. **Complete Angel Hierarchy** - Only 4-5 more pages needed for full coverage
