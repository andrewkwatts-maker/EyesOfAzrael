            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-primary);">Early Life</h2>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary);">Birth and Orphanhood</h3>
            <p>
                Muhammad was born in 570 CE during the "Year of the Elephant," when Abraha's army attempted to
                destroy the Kaaba. His father Abdullah died before his birth, and his mother Aminah passed away
                when he was six. Raised first by his grandfather Abdul-Muttalib, then by his uncle Abu Talib,
                Muhammad experienced the vulnerability of orphanhood—a condition that would later deeply influence
                his teachings on social justice and care for the vulnerable.
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">Character and Reputation</h3>
            <p>
                Even before prophethood, Muhammad was renowned for his impeccable character. The Quraysh tribe gave
                him the title "Al-Amin" (The Trustworthy) and "Al-Sadiq" (The Truthful). He worked as a merchant,
                known for honesty in business dealings. At age 25, he married Khadijah bint Khuwaylid, a wealthy
                merchant woman 15 years his senior, who recognized his integrity and character.
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">The Contemplative Years</h3>
            <p>
                Muhammad had a contemplative nature and would retreat to the Cave of Hira on Mount Jabal al-Nour
                for meditation and reflection. He was troubled by the idolatry, social injustice, and moral decay
                in Makkan society. These retreats prepared him for the momentous event that would change history.

            <p>
                When asked about Muhammad's character, his wife Aisha said: "His character was the Quran."
                He embodied the principles he preached: honesty, justice, mercy, patience, and complete submission
                to Allah. His companions noted that he never sought revenge for personal wrongs but only defended
                divine boundaries.

                one chapter matching its eloquence; none succeeded despite Arabia's rich literary culture.

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">The Sunnah</h3>
            <p>
                Muhammad's sayings (Hadith) and actions (Sunnah) form the second source of Islamic law after
                the Quran. His daily practices—from hygiene to worship to social conduct—provide Muslims with
                practical guidance for every aspect of life. The science of Hadith authentication became one
                of history's most rigorous systems of historical verification.

            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-primary);">Muhammad in Sufi Thought</h2>
            <p>
                Sufis view Muhammad as the Perfect Human (Al-Insan al-Kamil), the complete manifestation of
                divine attributes in human form. He represents the goal of spiritual development—complete
                annihilation of ego (fana) and subsistence in Allah (baqa).
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">The Muhammadan Light (Nur Muhammad)</h3>
            <p>
                Some Sufi traditions teach that Muhammad's spiritual essence was the first creation—a primordial
                light from which all existence emerged. This concept emphasizes his cosmic significance beyond
                historical personhood. The phrase "Were it not for you, I would not have created the universe"
                is attributed to this understanding.
