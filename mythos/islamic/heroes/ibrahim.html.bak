            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary);">Breaking the Idols</h3>
            <p>
                Ibrahim was born into a society steeped in <a href="#" class="inline-search-link" data-search-term="idolatry" onclick="performCodexSearch(event, 'idolatry')">idol worship</a>.
                His father Azar was a maker of idols, yet from his youth, Ibrahim questioned the worship of created things. He contemplated the stars, moon, and sun,
                each time rejecting them as objects of worship when they set, declaring his search for something eternal and unchanging.
            </p>

            <p>
                When his people went to a festival, Ibrahim remained behind and destroyed all the idols in the temple except the largest one, placing the axe
                in its hand. When confronted, he suggested they ask the remaining idol who did it, exposing the absurdity of worshipping powerless statues.
                This act of defiance led to his trial by fire.

            <p>
                Enraged by Ibrahim's destruction of their idols and his mockery of their beliefs, the people of his city decided to burn him alive.
                They built a massive fire, so large that birds flying overhead would fall from the sky from the intense heat. Ibrahim was catapulted
                into the flames, but Allah commanded: "O fire, be coolness and safety upon Ibrahim."
            </p>
            <p>
                The fire burned the ropes that bound him but did not harm Ibrahim himself. He emerged unscathed, a living miracle demonstrating Allah's

            <p>
                Perhaps the most famous trial of Ibrahim's faith was when he saw in a dream that he was sacrificing his beloved son.
                For prophets, dreams are a form of revelation, and Ibrahim knew this was a command from Allah. He approached his son
                (identified as Ismail in Islamic tradition) and asked what he thought. The young Ismail replied with perfect submission:
                "O my father, do as you are commanded. You will find me, if Allah wills, of the steadfast."
            </p>
            <p>
                As Ibrahim prepared to fulfill this divine command, demonstrating his willingness to sacrifice even his most precious possession
                in obedience to Allah, the angel called out: "O Ibrahim, you have fulfilled the vision." Allah ransomed Ismail with a magnificent
                sacrifice - a ram from Paradise. This event is commemorated annually during Eid al-Adha,
                when Muslims worldwide perform animal sacrifice, remembering Ibrahim's complete submission.

            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-primary);">Connections to Islamic Cosmology</h2>
            <p>
                Ibrahim's story is deeply connected to Islamic cosmological concepts. His establishment of pure <a href="../cosmology/tawhid.html" class="inline-search-link">Tawhid</a>
                (monotheism) forms the foundation of Islamic theology. The <a href="../creatures/jinn.html" class="inline-search-link">Jinn</a> witnessed his trials,
                and <a href="../deities/jibreel.html" class="inline-search-link">Jibreel</a> (Gabriel) appeared to Hajar during the search for water.
                Ibrahim's relationship with <a href="../deities/allah.html" class="inline-search-link">Allah</a> demonstrates the perfect model of submission,
                earning him a place in <a href="../cosmology/afterlife.html" class="inline-search-link">Jannah</a> (Paradise) as one of the greatest prophets.

                - the Friend of Allah. This intimate relationship was built on absolute trust, unwavering obedience, and complete submission.

                When Ibrahim asked Allah to show him how He gives life to the dead, Allah asked if he did not believe. Ibrahim replied: "Yes, but [I ask]
                only that my heart may be satisfied." Allah then told him to take four birds, train them to come to him, then place parts of them on different hills
                and call them - they came back to life and flew to him. This was not a test of Ibrahim's faith, but rather Allah honoring His friend's request
                for direct experiential knowledge.

            <p>
                Ibrahim embodies the essence of Islam (submission to Allah). The Quran states: "Ibrahim was neither a Jew nor a Christian,
                but he was one inclining toward truth, a Muslim [submitting to Allah]" (3:67). His life demonstrates that true faith transcends
                ethnic, cultural, and temporal boundaries - it is pure devotion to the One God.

                and Islam, Ibrahim represents the shared foundation of monotheistic faith. Through his sons Ishaq (Isaac) and Ismail (Ishmael),
                he fathered the lines that would produce both the Israelite prophets and the final messenger,
                <a href="../deities/muhammad.html" class="inline-search-link">Muhammad</a>.

            <p>
                The term "Hanif" refers to the pure monotheistic faith of Ibrahim, free from all polytheism and innovation. This tradition
                survived in Arabia even during the time of idol worship, with a few individuals like <a href="#" class="inline-search-link" data-search-term="Zayd ibn Amr" onclick="performCodexSearch(event, 'Zayd ibn Amr')">Zayd ibn Amr</a>
                maintaining it before Islam was revealed. Muhammad was commanded to "follow the religion of Ibrahim, the Hanif."
