<h2>Isa ibn Maryam - Jesus, Son of Mary</h2>
<p>
In Islamic tradition, <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Isa" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../corpus-results/islamic/isa.html" title="Search corpus for 'Isa'">Isa</a> (Jesus) is one of the greatest prophets of Allah, born miraculously to the virgin Maryam
(Mary) and given extraordinary powers including healing the sick, raising the dead, and creating life from clay. Muslims
revere him as al-Masih (the Messiah) and a prophet sent to the Children of <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Israel" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../corpus-results/islamic/israel.html" title="Search corpus for 'Israel'">Israel</a>. However, Islam rejects the Christian
doctrines of his divinity, crucifixion, and resurrection, teaching instead that he was a human prophet who was raised to
heaven alive and will return before the Day of Judgment.
</p>

<h2>The Miraculous Birth</h2>
<p>
The Quran describes <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Isa" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../corpus-results/islamic/isa.html" title="Search corpus for 'Isa'">Isa</a>'s birth in Surah Maryam (Chapter 19). Maryam, a righteous young woman devoted to worship in the
Temple, was visited by the angel Jibril (Gabriel) who announced that Allah would grant her a son despite her virginity.
When she asked "How can I have a son when no man has touched me?" the angel replied, "It is easy for Allah." Allah created
<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Isa" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../corpus-results/islamic/isa.html" title="Search corpus for 'Isa'">Isa</a> in her womb by His word "Be," just as He created Adam without parents—demonstrating divine power over natural laws.
</p>

<p>
Maryam withdrew to a remote place to give birth. As she labored in pain beneath a palm tree, the infant <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Isa" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../corpus-results/islamic/isa.html" title="Search corpus for 'Isa'">Isa</a> miraculously
spoke from the cradle, comforting her and instructing her to shake the palm tree for fresh dates and drink from a stream
that appeared. When she returned to her people carrying the baby, they accused her of immorality. The infant <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Isa" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../corpus-results/islamic/isa.html" title="Search corpus for 'Isa'">Isa</a> spoke
again, declaring: "I am the servant of Allah. He has given me the Scripture and made me a prophet."
</p>

<h2>Prophethood and Miracles</h2>
<p>
<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Isa" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../corpus-results/islamic/isa.html" title="Search corpus for 'Isa'">Isa</a> was given the Injil (Gospel), a divine scripture to guide the Children of <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Israel" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../corpus-results/islamic/israel.html" title="Search corpus for 'Israel'">Israel</a>. Allah granted him miraculous
powers as signs of his prophethood:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Creating birds from clay:</strong> <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Isa" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../corpus-results/islamic/isa.html" title="Search corpus for 'Isa'">Isa</a> fashioned birds from clay, breathed into them, and they became living
creatures by Allah's permission</li>
<li><strong>Healing:</strong> He cured the blind and the leper</li>
<li><strong>Raising the dead:</strong> He brought the dead back to life by Allah's will</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge of the unseen:</strong> He knew what people stored in their houses and what they ate</li>
<li><strong>The Table from Heaven:</strong> When his disciples requested a miraculous sign, Allah sent down a table spread with
food from heaven as a blessing and a test</li>
</ul>

<h2>Message and Mission</h2>
<p>
<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Isa" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../corpus-results/islamic/isa.html" title="Search corpus for 'Isa'">Isa</a>'s message was pure monotheism (tawhid)—the worship of Allah alone. The Quran emphasizes that he never claimed
divinity but repeatedly affirmed his servanthood to Allah. He came to confirm the Torah, relax certain restrictions that
had been placed on the Jews, and call people to worship Allah alone. He chose twelve disciples (al-Hawariyyun) who
supported his mission and helped spread his message.
</p>

<h2>The Plot Against Him</h2>
<p>
When the religious authorities of the Children of <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Israel" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../corpus-results/islamic/israel.html" title="Search corpus for 'Israel'">Israel</a> rejected <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Isa" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../corpus-results/islamic/isa.html" title="Search corpus for 'Isa'">Isa</a>'s message, they plotted to kill him. However,
Islamic teaching diverges dramatically from Christianity at this point: the Quran states "they did not kill him, nor did
they crucify him, but it was made to appear so to them" (Quran 4:157). Islamic tradition teaches that Allah raised <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Isa" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../corpus-results/islamic/isa.html" title="Search corpus for 'Isa'">Isa</a>
to heaven alive, and someone else (possibly Judas or a volunteer) was made to resemble him and was crucified instead.
</p>

<h2>Ascension to Heaven</h2>
<p>
Allah raised <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Isa" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../corpus-results/islamic/isa.html" title="Search corpus for 'Isa'">Isa</a> to Himself, preserving him from death and crucifixion. He remains alive in heaven and will return
to earth before the Day of Judgment. This ascension is seen as a vindication of his prophethood and a demonstration of
Allah's power to protect His chosen messengers.
</p>

<h2>The Second Coming</h2>
<p>
Islamic eschatology teaches that <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Isa" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../corpus-results/islamic/isa.html" title="Search corpus for 'Isa'">Isa</a> will return to earth as a major sign of the approaching Day of Judgment. When he
descends (likely in Damascus), he will:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Defeat the Dajjal (the Islamic Antichrist/False Messiah)</li>
<li>Break the cross (symbolically rejecting claims of his divinity)</li>
<li>Abolish the jizya (tax on non-Muslims, as all will convert to true monotheism)</li>
<li>Kill swine (forbidden in Islamic law)</li>
<li>Establish justice and prosperity on earth</li>
<li>Rule according to Islamic law as a just leader</li>
<li>Marry, have children, and live for a time before dying a natural death</li>
<li>Be buried in Medina next to Prophet Muhammad</li>
</ul>

<h2>Islamic View vs. Christian View</h2>
<p>
Islam honors <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Isa" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../corpus-results/islamic/isa.html" title="Search corpus for 'Isa'">Isa</a> as one of the greatest prophets (ulul-azm, those of great resolve) but rejects central Christian
doctrines:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Not Divine:</strong> <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Isa" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../corpus-results/islamic/isa.html" title="Search corpus for 'Isa'">Isa</a> is a human prophet, not God incarnate or the Son of God</li>
<li><strong>No Trinity:</strong> The doctrine of the Trinity is considered shirk (associating partners with Allah), the
unforgivable sin</li>
<li><strong>No Crucifixion:</strong> He was not crucified and did not die for humanity's sins</li>
<li><strong>No Resurrection:</strong> Since he didn't die, there was no resurrection (he will die after his second coming)</li>
<li><strong>No Atonement:</strong> Each person is responsible for their own sins; no one bears another's burden</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Quran criticizes Christians for deifying <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Isa" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../corpus-results/islamic/isa.html" title="Search corpus for 'Isa'">Isa</a> and teaches that on the Day of Judgment, Allah will ask him, "O Jesus,
son of Mary, did you say to the people, 'Take me and my mother as deities besides Allah?'" <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Isa" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../corpus-results/islamic/isa.html" title="Search corpus for 'Isa'">Isa</a> will reply, "Exalted
are You! It was not for me to say that to which I have no right... I said not to them except what You commanded me—to
worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord" (Quran 5:116-117).
</p>

<h2>Significance in Islam</h2>
<p>
<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Isa" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../corpus-results/islamic/isa.html" title="Search corpus for 'Isa'">Isa</a> is mentioned 25 times in the Quran by name (more than Muhammad), and an entire chapter (Surah Maryam) is dedicated
to his mother. Belief in <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Isa" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../corpus-results/islamic/isa.html" title="Search corpus for 'Isa'">Isa</a> as a prophet is a fundamental article of Islamic faith—denying his prophethood would
make one a non-believer. Muslims say "peace be upon him" after mentioning his name, as they do for all prophets. His
virgin birth is considered a miracle and sign of Allah's power, and Maryam is revered as the most righteous woman who
ever lived. <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Isa" data-tradition="islamic" href="../../../corpus-results/islamic/isa.html" title="Search corpus for 'Isa'">Isa</a> bridges Islamic and Christian traditions, though the two faiths interpret his nature and mission very
differently.
