            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary);">The Tyrant's Decree</h3>
            <p>
                Musa was born during a time of oppression when <a href="#" class="inline-search-link" data-search-term="Pharaoh" onclick="performCodexSearch(event, 'Pharaoh')">Fir'awn</a>
                (Pharaoh) ruled Egypt with tyranny. A prophecy warned that a child from the Israelites would overthrow him, so Pharaoh decreed
                that all newborn Israelite boys be killed. Allah inspired Musa's mother to place her infant son in a basket and set him adrift
                on the Nile River, with the promise that he would be returned to her.
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">Raised in the Palace</h3>
            <p>
                The basket was found by Pharaoh's wife <a href="#" class="inline-search-link" data-search-term="Asiya" onclick="performCodexSearch(event, 'Asiya')">Asiya</a>,
                one of the four perfect women in Islamic tradition. She convinced Pharaoh to adopt the child, saying "A comfort of the eye for me and for you.
                Do not kill him; perhaps he may benefit us, or we may adopt him as a son" (Quran 28:9). Miraculously, baby Musa refused all wet nurses
                until his own mother was brought to nurse him, reuniting mother and child while fulfilling Allah's promise.

                        so that he would become to them an enemy and a [source of] grief. Indeed, Pharaoh and Haman and their soldiers were deliberate sinners.
                        And the wife of Pharaoh said, '[He will be] a comfort of the eye for me and for you. Do not kill him; perhaps he may benefit us,
                        or we may adopt him as a son.' And they perceived not. And the heart of Musa's mother became empty [of all else]. She was about to disclose
                        [the matter concerning] him had We not bound fast her heart that she would be of the believers. And she said to his sister,
                        'Follow him'; so she watched him from a distance while they perceived not. And We had prevented from him [all] wet nurses before,
                        so she said, 'Shall I direct you to a household that will be responsible for him for you while they are to him [for his upbringing] sincere?'

                As a young man in Pharaoh's palace, Musa witnessed an Egyptian oppressing an Israelite. When Musa intervened, he struck the Egyptian,
                accidentally killing him. Filled with remorse, Musa prayed: "My Lord, indeed I have wronged myself, so forgive me" (Quran 28:16).
                Allah forgave him, but when the incident became known, Musa fled Egypt to the land of <a href="#" class="inline-search-link" data-search-term="Madyan" onclick="performCodexSearch(event, 'Madyan')">Madyan</a>.

            <p>
                In Madyan, Musa helped two women water their flocks, displaying the noble character that would mark his prophethood. The women's father,
                the prophet Shu'ayb (Jethro), offered Musa marriage to one of his daughters in exchange
                for eight years of service. Musa accepted, spent the years in humble work, and matured into the man who would confront Pharaoh.

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary);">The Two Signs</h3>
            <p>
                Allah equipped Musa with two miraculous signs: his staff that turned into a serpent, and his hand that shone with divine light when placed
                in his garment. These signs demonstrated Allah's power over creation - the staff showing dominion over life, the shining hand representing
                divine knowledge and authority.
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">The Contest with the Magicians</h3>
            <p>
                Pharaoh gathered his best magicians to challenge Musa. They threw down their ropes
                and staffs, creating illusions of serpents. When Musa threw down his staff, it became a real serpent that swallowed all their illusions.
                The magicians, recognizing true divine power, immediately prostrated in belief, declaring: "We believe in the Lord of Harun and Musa" (Quran 20:70).
                Despite Pharaoh's threats of crucifixion, they remained steadfast, choosing eternal truth over temporal power.

                (Sinai). Musa asked to see Allah directly, and was told: "You will not see Me, but look at the mountain; if it should remain in place, then you will see Me"
                (Quran 7:143). When Allah manifested His glory to the mountain, it crumbled to dust, and Musa fell unconscious, realizing the impossibility of perceiving
                the Divine Essence in this world.

                fashioned a golden calf from the people's jewelry. The calf made a lowing sound, and some Israelites began worshipping it, breaking their covenant with Allah.

            <p>
                In a profound lesson on divine wisdom, Musa encountered Al-Khidr,
                a mysterious servant of Allah possessing special knowledge. Musa asked to accompany him to learn, but Al-Khidr warned that Musa would not have patience
                with things he did not understand. During their journey, Al-Khidr performed three seemingly unjust acts: damaging a boat, killing a young boy,
                and repairing a wall for ungrateful people.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each time, Musa objected, breaking his promise of patience. Finally, Al-Khidr explained: the boat belonged to poor people and he damaged it
                to save it from a tyrannical king seizing every boat; the boy would have grieved his righteous parents with disbelief and disobedience,
                and Allah would replace him with a better child; the wall belonged to orphaned boys whose righteous father had buried treasure beneath it,
                and Allah willed it preserved until they matured. This story teaches that divine wisdom operates beyond human comprehension.

                        He said, 'Indeed, with me you will never be able to have patience. And how can you have patience for what you do not encompass in knowledge?'

            <p>
                Islamic scholars note many parallels between Musa and <a href="../deities/muhammad.html" class="inline-search-link">Prophet Muhammad</a>:
                both were orphaned, raised in privilege, called to prophethood at Mount (Tur/Hira), persecuted by their people, made migration (hijrah),
                achieved victory after years of struggle, and brought divine law. The Quran frequently addresses Prophet Muhammad through stories of Musa,
                providing comfort during persecution and guidance for leadership.
            </p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">The Tawrat (Torah)</h3>
            <p>
                Musa received the Tawrat, one of the four major scriptures in Islam
                (along with Zabur/Psalms, Injil/Gospel, and Quran). While the original Torah has been altered according to Islamic belief,
                Muslims respect it as divine revelation containing guidance and light for the Children of Israel.

            <p>
                Musa's story embodies key Islamic concepts. His direct communication with <a href="../deities/allah.html" class="inline-search-link">Allah</a>
                demonstrates the prophetic relationship, while his struggle with Pharaoh illustrates the battle between <a href="../cosmology/tawhid.html" class="inline-search-link">Tawhid</a>
                (monotheism) and tyranny. The <a href="../creatures/jinn.html" class="inline-search-link">Jinn</a> worked under authority during Solomon's time,
                and <a href="../deities/jibreel.html" class="inline-search-link">Jibreel</a> (Gabriel) revealed the Torah to him on Mount Sinai.
                His journey demonstrates the reality of prophetic vision and his place in <a href="../cosmology/afterlife.html" class="inline-search-link">Jannah</a> (Paradise).
