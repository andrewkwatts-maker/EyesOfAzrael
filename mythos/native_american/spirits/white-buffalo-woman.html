            <p class="subtitle" style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin: 0.5rem 0;">Pte Ska Win - Sacred Messenger of the Lakota</p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
                White Buffalo Calf Woman (Pte Ska Win in Lakota) is one of the most sacred and revered
                figures in Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota spirituality. She appeared to the people in a time
                of great need, bringing the sacred pipe (Chanunpa) and the seven sacred rites that form
                the foundation of Lakota spiritual practice. Her story speaks of the sacred feminine,
                the power of right relationship, and the promise of renewal. Her return, prophesied to
                occur in times of great change, is heralded by the birth of white buffalo calves.

            <div class="story-box">
                <h3>The Coming of White Buffalo Calf Woman</h3>
                <p>Long ago, when the Lakota were experiencing a time of famine and hardship, two young
                scouts were sent out to search for buffalo. As they stood on a hill scanning the horizon,
                they saw something approaching - a beautiful woman dressed in white buckskin, walking
                toward them across the prairie.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">As she came closer, they saw that she was more beautiful than any woman they had
                ever seen. One of the scouts had impure thoughts and reached out to touch her. Instantly,
                a cloud of mist surrounded him, and when it cleared, only his skeleton remained - he had
                been destroyed by his own disrespect.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">The other scout, who had approached with a humble and pure heart, was told: "Go to
                your people and tell them to prepare a great lodge. I am coming to bring them something
                holy."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="story-box">
                <h3>The Gift of the Sacred Pipe</h3>
                <p>The scout returned and told the people what he had seen. They prepared a great lodge,
                and soon the mysterious woman appeared. She carried a bundle on her back, and as she
                entered the lodge, the people felt a sense of overwhelming peace and reverence.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">She opened her bundle and revealed the Sacred Pipe - the Chanunpa. The bowl, she
                explained, represented the earth and all female beings. The stem represented all that
                grows upon the earth and all male beings. When joined together and filled with sacred
                tobacco, the pipe became a living prayer that connected the people to Wakan Tanka (the
                Great Mystery) and to all of creation.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">"With this pipe," she said, "you will send your voices to Wakan Tanka, your
                Grandfather and Father, and to Grandmother and Mother Earth. All things are connected.
                When you pray with this pipe, you pray with and for everything."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="story-box">
                <h3>The Seven Sacred Rites</h3>
                <p>White Buffalo Calf Woman taught the people the seven sacred rites that would guide
                their spiritual life:</p>
                <div class="rite-item">
                    <strong>1. Inikagapi (Inipi) - The Sweat Lodge:</strong> A purification ceremony
                    using heated stones and prayer, representing spiritual rebirth and cleansing.
                </div>
                <div class="rite-item">
                    <strong>2. Hanbleceya - The Vision Quest:</strong> A solitary time of fasting and
                    prayer seeking guidance and vision from the spirits.
                </div>
                <div class="rite-item">
                    <strong>3. Wiwanyag Wachipi - The Sun Dance:</strong> The central ceremony of the
                    Lakota, a communal dance of sacrifice, prayer, and renewal.
                </div>
                <div class="rite-item">
                    <strong>4. Hunkapi - The Making of Relatives:</strong> A ceremony establishing bonds
                    of kinship and peace between peoples.
                </div>
                <div class="rite-item">
                    <strong>5. Ishna Ta Awi Cha Lowan - Preparing a Girl for Womanhood:</strong> A
                    coming-of-age ceremony honoring the sacred transition to womanhood.
                </div>
                <div class="rite-item">
                    <strong>6. Tapa Wanka Yap - The Throwing of the Ball:</strong> A ceremony representing
                    the universe and the receiving of knowledge.
                </div>
                <div class="rite-item">
                    <strong>7. Nagi Gluhapi - The Keeping of the Soul:</strong> A mourning ceremony
                    honoring the deceased and supporting their spirit's journey.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="story-box">
                <h3>Her Departure and Promise</h3>
                <p>After teaching the people these sacred ways, White Buffalo Calf Woman prepared to leave.
                She told them that she would look back on them in every age, and that she would return
                at the end of an age.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">As she walked away from the lodge, she stopped and rolled upon the earth. When she
                rose, she had transformed into a black buffalo. She walked further, rolled again, and
                became a brown buffalo. Rolling a third time, she became a red buffalo. Finally, on
                her fourth roll, she became a white buffalo calf - the most sacred of all animals - and
                disappeared over the hill.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">The Sacred Pipe she left behind has been kept by the Lakota ever since, currently
                in the care of the Arvol Looking Horse family at Green Grass, South Dakota. It is among
                the most sacred objects in Native American spirituality.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <div class="prophecy-box">
            <h3>The Prophecy of Her Return</h3>
            <p>White Buffalo Calf Woman prophesied that she would return in a time of great change and
            hardship for the people. Her return would be signaled by the birth of white buffalo calves.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">In 1994, a white buffalo calf named Miracle was born in Wisconsin, the first in
            several generations. Since then, several more white buffalo calves have been born. Many
            Lakota elders see these births as signs that the prophecy is being fulfilled and that
            humanity is entering a time of great spiritual significance.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">The prophecy speaks of a time when all peoples will come together in peace and
            harmony, recognizing their relationship to each other and to the earth. White Buffalo Calf
            Woman's return heralds this era of healing and unity.</p>

            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary);">The Sacred Pipe (Chanunpa)</h2>
            <p>The Sacred Pipe is at the heart of Lakota spirituality:</p>
            <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>The Bowl:</strong> Usually made of red pipestone (catlinite) from the sacred
                quarries at Pipestone, Minnesota. Represents the feminine, the earth, all female beings.</li>
                <li><strong>The Stem:</strong> Made of wood, often ash. Represents the masculine, all
                that grows upon the earth, all male beings.</li>
                <li><strong>Union:</strong> When bowl and stem are joined, all of creation is united in
                prayer. The smoke carries prayers to the spirit world.</li>
                <li><strong>Tobacco:</strong> Sacred tobacco (not commercial tobacco) is offered and
                smoked as a sacrifice and prayer.</li>
                <li><strong>Respect:</strong> The pipe is never used casually. It is taken out only for
                serious prayer and ceremony, and is treated with the utmost reverence.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>Sacred Feminine:</strong> White Buffalo Calf Woman embodies the power and
                wisdom of the sacred feminine. Her teachings came through a woman, reminding the people
                to honor women and feminine power.</li>
                <li><strong>Right Relationship:</strong> The first scout's destruction and the second's
                blessing teach the importance of approaching the sacred with respect and purity of heart.</li>
                <li><strong>Mitakuye Oyasin - "All My Relations":</strong> Her teaching that the pipe
                connects all beings expresses the fundamental Lakota understanding of interconnection.</li>
                <li><strong>Prayer as Connection:</strong> Through the pipe, prayer becomes a physical
                act of connection to all that is, visible and invisible.</li>
                <li><strong>Living Prophecy:</strong> The prophecy of her return keeps her presence alive
                in the present, giving hope and calling people to prepare for transformation.</li>

            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary);">Cultural Respect</h2>
            <p>White Buffalo Calf Woman and the teachings she brought are among the most sacred elements
            of Lakota spirituality. The sacred pipe ceremonies are not open to outsiders, and many
            details of the rites are not shared publicly. This is respected.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Non-Native people are asked to approach these teachings with humility and respect,
            to support Lakota sovereignty and religious freedom, and not to appropriate ceremonies or
            symbols without permission and proper relationship.</p>
