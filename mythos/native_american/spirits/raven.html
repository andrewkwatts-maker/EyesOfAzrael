            <p class="subtitle" style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin: 0.5rem 0;">Creator, Transformer, Trickster, Light-Bringer</p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
                Raven is the central figure in the mythology of Pacific Northwest Coast peoples - the
                Tlingit, Haida, Tsimshian, and many others. Far more than a simple trickster, Raven is
                a creator being who shaped the world, stole the sun to bring light to humanity, and
                continues to transform reality through his cunning and power. His black feathers hold
                the darkness from before creation; his voice calls forth change. Raven is the original
                transformer, constantly shifting between human and bird form, between sacred and profane,
                between creation and chaos.

            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary);">Tribal Traditions</h2>
            <p>Raven appears across Pacific Northwest cultures with variations in his stories and significance:</p>

            <div class="tribal-note">
                <strong>Tlingit:</strong> Yeil (Raven) is the creator and transformer who made the world
                suitable for humans. He released the sun, moon, and stars; created the rivers; and taught
                humans how to live. Raven is one of the two primary moieties (clan divisions) of Tlingit
                society, along with Eagle/Wolf.
            </div>

            <div class="tribal-note">
                <strong>Haida:</strong> Raven (Nankil'slas) is central to Haida cosmology, appearing
                prominently in their sophisticated art tradition. The Haida tell of Raven discovering the
                first humans in a clamshell and coaxing them out into the world. Raven is featured on many
                totem poles, house fronts, and ceremonial objects.
            </div>

            <div class="tribal-note">
                <strong>Tsimshian:</strong> Txamsem (Raven) is a complex figure who can be both hero and
                villain. The Tsimshian tell detailed stories of Raven's birth, his acquisition of his
                black color, and his many transformations. Their Raven stories often emphasize his
                voracious appetite and its consequences.
            </div>

            <div class="tribal-note">
                <strong>Kwakwaka'wakw (Kwakiutl):</strong> Raven appears in their mythology though he is
                somewhat less central than among northern peoples. He is associated with the sun and with
                transformation, appearing in winter ceremonial dances and crest art.
            </div>
        </section>

        <section style="margin-top: 2rem;">
            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary);">Major Stories</h2>

            <div class="story-box">
                <h3>Raven Steals the Sun</h3>
                <p>In the time of darkness, before there was any light in the world, there was an old
                chief who kept the sun, moon, and stars locked in three bentwood boxes in his house.
                Raven heard of this and determined to steal the light for the world.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Raven transformed himself into a hemlock needle and floated in the water where the
                chief's daughter came to drink. She swallowed the needle, became pregnant, and gave birth
                to a child - Raven in human form. The old chief loved his grandson dearly and could deny
                him nothing.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">The child (Raven) cried and pointed at the boxes until his grandfather gave him the
                box containing the stars, which he opened and threw into the sky, scattering the stars
                across the heavens. Then he cried for the moon and did the same. Finally, he cried for
                the last box, containing the sun.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">When his grandfather reluctantly gave it to him, Raven transformed back into a bird,
                seized the sun in his beak, and flew out through the smoke hole. The smoke turned his
                feathers black (they had been white before). He flew across the world, releasing the sun
                into the sky, bringing light to all creatures.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Teaching:</strong> The greatest gifts often come through cunning and sacrifice.
                Raven's transformation from white to black represents the cost of bringing light - the
                light-bringer carries the darkness.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="story-box">
                <h3>Raven and the First Humans (Haida)</h3>
                <p>Raven was walking along the beach at Rose Spit (Haida Gwaii) when he heard strange
                sounds coming from a giant clamshell. Curious, he investigated and found tiny creatures
                huddled inside - the first humans.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">They were afraid to come out into the vast world, so Raven used his charm and cunning
                to coax them from the shell. Some versions say he sang to them; others that he made
                promises of wonders. Slowly, the first Haida emerged from the clamshell onto the beach.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">But there were only men in the shell. Raven knew they needed women to survive. So he
                searched until he found some chitons (a type of shellfish) and transformed them into
                women. Thus humanity began.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Teaching:</strong> Humans are creatures of the sea and shore. We emerged
                reluctantly into the world, coaxed by forces greater than ourselves. Creation is ongoing,
                and transformation is always possible.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="story-box">
                <h3>Raven and the Salmon</h3>
                <p>In the early days, there were no salmon in the rivers. Raven knew that a great chief
                kept all the salmon trapped in a weir across the river's mouth. Without salmon, the
                people would starve.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Raven tried many tricks to release the salmon - he pretended to be a shaman, he
                attempted to bribe the chief, he tried to sneak in at night. All failed. Finally, Raven
                transformed himself into a salmon and swam into the weir. From inside, he broke the weir
                apart, releasing all the salmon into the rivers.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">As the salmon swam upstream, Raven flew alongside, guiding them to all the rivers and
                streams. This is why salmon return to so many waters - Raven showed them the way.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Teaching:</strong> The resources of the world should not be hoarded by the few.
                Sometimes you must become what you seek to free in order to liberate it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="story-box">
                <h3>Why Raven is Black</h3>
                <p>Before Raven stole the sun, his feathers were pure white - the most beautiful of all
                birds. But when he flew up through the smoke hole with the sun in his beak, the smoke
                stained his feathers black forever.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">In some versions, Raven's color comes from being caught in a fire, or from being
                punished for his tricks. In all versions, his blackness is tied to his role as
                transformer - he carries the mark of his deeds.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">The Tlingit say that Raven's black feathers contain the original darkness of the
                world before light. He took the darkness into himself so that light could shine.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Teaching:</strong> Transformation comes at a cost. Those who bring light into
                the world often carry darkness within themselves. The black feathers are not shame but
                honor - the mark of one who sacrificed for others.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="totem-section">
            <h3>Raven in Northwest Coast Art</h3>
            <p>Raven is one of the most depicted figures in Northwest Coast art, appearing on:</p>
            <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>Totem Poles:</strong> Raven often appears at the top of totem poles, or as
                a central figure telling his stories. The "Raven and the First Men" pole by Bill Reid is
                world-famous.</li>
                <li><strong>House Fronts:</strong> Traditional longhouses often featured Raven in their
                painted facades, indicating the clan affiliation of the inhabitants.</li>
                <li><strong>Ceremonial Objects:</strong> Raven rattles, masks, and regalia are used in
                potlatches and other ceremonies.</li>
                <li><strong>Bentwood Boxes:</strong> The same type of box Raven opened to release the sun
                is decorated with formline designs often featuring Raven.</li>
                <li><strong>Button Blankets:</strong> Clan crests including Raven are displayed on these
                ceremonial garments.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">The distinctive "formline" art style of the Northwest Coast renders Raven in bold,
            flowing designs of black and red (with blue-green) that have become iconic symbols of
            indigenous art worldwide.</p>
        </div>

        <section style="margin-top: 2rem;">
            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary);">The Nature of Raven</h2>
            <p>Understanding Raven requires embracing his paradoxical nature:</p>
            <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>Creator and Trickster:</strong> Unlike many trickster figures, Raven is also
                a primary creator. He shaped the world while playing tricks.</li>
                <li><strong>Selfish and Beneficial:</strong> Raven's motives are usually selfish - hunger,
                curiosity, greed - yet his actions benefit humanity. He didn't steal the sun out of
                compassion but because he wanted it. Yet we have light.</li>
                <li><strong>Sacred and Profane:</strong> Raven appears in the most sacred ceremonies and
                the most ribald stories. He is simultaneously holy and crude.</li>
                <li><strong>Transformer:</strong> Raven's core nature is transformation. He changes shape
                constantly - bird to human, child to adult, living to dead and back. Nothing is fixed.</li>
                <li><strong>Voracious Appetite:</strong> Raven is always hungry - for food, for knowledge,
                for experience. This appetite drives creation itself.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary);">Raven and Coyote</h2>
            <p>Raven shares much with his cousin trickster Coyote of the interior West:</p>
            <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li>Both are transformers who shape the world through their actions</li>
                <li>Both bring essential gifts (fire for Coyote, light for Raven)</li>
                <li>Both are driven by appetites - often getting into trouble</li>
                <li>Both teach through failure as much as success</li>
                <li>Both are associated with actual animals known for their intelligence and adaptability</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">The key difference: Raven is more explicitly a creator deity, while Coyote is more
            purely a trickster. Raven's stories emphasize his cosmic role; Coyote's often emphasize
            his foolishness.</p>

            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary);">Living Traditions</h2>
            <p>Raven remains central to Northwest Coast cultures today:</p>
            <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li>Raven clan members continue to identify with their ancestral crest</li>
                <li>Contemporary artists create new Raven works in traditional and innovative styles</li>
                <li>Raven stories are told in schools, homes, and ceremonial contexts</li>
                <li>The totem pole tradition continues, with Raven prominent in new poles</li>
                <li>Raven appears in literature, film, and popular culture, introducing his stories to
                new audiences</li>
