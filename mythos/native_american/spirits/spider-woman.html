            <p class="subtitle" style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin: 0.5rem 0;">Na'ashjei'ii Asdzaa - Grandmother Spider, Weaver of Life</p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
                Spider Woman is one of the most important creator figures in the traditions of the
                American Southwest. Known by many names - Na'ashjei'ii Asdzaa to the Navajo, Kokyangwuti
                to the Hopi, Spider Grandmother to many peoples - she is the ancient being who wove the
                world into existence, taught humans the sacred art of weaving, and continues to guide
                those who seek wisdom. Her web connects all things, and her teachings speak to the
                interconnection of all existence.

            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-primary);">Tribal Traditions</h2>
            <p>Spider Woman appears across Southwest traditions with variations in her role and significance:</p>

            <div class="tribal-note">
                <strong>Navajo (Dine):</strong> Na'ashjei'ii Asdzaa (Spider Woman) is a helper deity who
                appears in many stories. She taught the Dine people how to weave, instructing them to
                build their looms with sacred materials and to place a small hole (spirit hole) in each
                weaving to release the weaver's spirit. She also helped the Hero Twins on their journey
                to their father, the Sun.
            </div>

            <div class="tribal-note">
                <strong>Hopi:</strong> Kokyangwuti (Spider Grandmother) is one of the most powerful
                creator deities. With Tawa (the Sun), she created the First World and led the people
                through successive worlds during times of corruption and renewal. She shaped humans from
                clay and brought them to life with her song. She continues to guide the Hopi people.
            </div>

            <div class="tribal-note">
                <strong>Keresan Pueblos:</strong> Sussistanako (Thought Woman/Thinking Woman) is the
                supreme creator who brought everything into existence through thought. She conceived of
                the world in her mind, and her thoughts became reality. Spider Woman is often associated
                with or an aspect of this primordial thinking being.
            </div>

            <div class="tribal-note">
                <strong>Cherokee:</strong> Grandmother Spider brought fire to the people when other
                animals had failed. She wove a small pot from clay, traveled to the other side of the
                world where fire lived, and brought back an ember in her pot while other creatures
                burned or were changed trying the same feat.
            </div>
        </section>

        <section style="margin-top: 2rem;">
            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-primary);">Creation Stories</h2>

            <div class="story-box">
                <h3>The Weaving of the World (Hopi)</h3>
                <p>In the beginning, there was only endless space and Tawa, the Sun Spirit, who existed
                in the void. Tawa wished to create a world, so he gathered his thoughts and created
                Kokyangwuti - Spider Grandmother - to be his helper and co-creator.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Spider Grandmother began to weave. She wove the sacred web of creation, and as she
                wove, she sang the creation song. From her web came the earth, the sky, the waters, and
                all living things. She shaped humans from clay - four colors of clay for four peoples -
                and covered them with her white cape woven of creative wisdom.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">She sang over them, and they came to life. Then she led them through the worlds,
                guiding them upward through the emergence place (sipapu) when each world became corrupt,
                until they reached this Fourth World where we now live.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Teaching:</strong> Creation comes through thought, creativity, and patient
                work. The world is literally woven together - all things are connected in the great web.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="story-box">
                <h3>Spider Woman and the Hero Twins (Navajo)</h3>
                <p>When Monster Slayer and Born for Water, the Hero Twins, set out to find their father
                the Sun and obtain weapons to defeat the monsters plaguing the people, they faced many
                dangers on their journey.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Spider Woman found them and gave them sacred gifts: eagle feathers for protection,
                sacred stones, and most importantly, the knowledge of the life-giving trail to the Sun's
                house. She taught them the sacred words to say when challenged, which would prove their
                divine heritage.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Without Spider Woman's guidance, the twins could not have completed their quest.
                Her wisdom and gifts allowed them to survive the trials set by the Sun and obtain the
                lightning weapons needed to make the world safe for humans.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Teaching:</strong> Wisdom often comes from unexpected sources. The elderly
                grandmother, seemingly weak, holds the knowledge that makes heroes' journeys possible.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="story-box">
                <h3>The Gift of Weaving (Navajo)</h3>
                <p>Long ago, the Navajo people did not know how to weave. Spider Woman saw that they
                needed protection from the cold and beauty in their lives. She came to a young woman
                and taught her the sacred art.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">"Build your loom from the sky," Spider Woman instructed. "The cross poles shall
                be made of sky and earth cords, the warp sticks of sun rays, the heddle of rock crystal
                and sheet lightning. The batten shall be a sun halo, the comb white shell."</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">She taught that each weaving should have a spirit line - a small break in the
                pattern - so the weaver's spirit would not be trapped in the work. She taught the sacred
                designs that tell stories and carry power.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">To this day, Navajo weavers honor Spider Woman when they work, and the art of
                weaving remains sacred, passed down through generations.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Teaching:</strong> Creative work is sacred work. The act of making is a form
                of prayer, and what we create carries spiritual power.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="weaving-teaching">
            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-red); margin-top: 0;">The Sacred Art of Weaving</h2>
            <p>For the Navajo people, weaving is not merely craft - it is a sacred practice taught by
            Spider Woman herself. Several traditions connect weaving to spiritual wisdom:</p>
            <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>The Spirit Line (Ch'ihonit'i):</strong> A deliberate "flaw" or line that breaks
                the border pattern, allowing the weaver's spirit to exit the textile. Without this, the
                weaver's creativity could become trapped.</li>
                <li><strong>Spider Hole:</strong> Some weavers leave a small opening in the center of
                their work to honor Spider Woman and acknowledge the web's center.</li>
                <li><strong>Sacred Materials:</strong> Traditional looms incorporate symbols of the cosmos -
                representing the connection between the act of weaving and the original weaving of creation.</li>
                <li><strong>Young weavers</strong> are sometimes told to find a spider web and press it
                to their hands to absorb Spider Woman's skill and blessing.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <section style="margin-top: 2rem;">
            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-primary);">Symbolism &amp; Teachings</h2>
            <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>Interconnection:</strong> The spider's web represents the interconnection
                of all things. Every strand is connected; touching one part affects the whole. This is
                the fundamental nature of reality.</li>
                <li><strong>Creative Power:</strong> Spider Woman creates through weaving - through patient,
                careful, creative work. This teaches that creation requires time, skill, and dedication.</li>
                <li><strong>Grandmother Wisdom:</strong> Spider Woman is always depicted as elderly, a
                grandmother. This honors the wisdom of elders and the power of feminine knowledge.</li>
                <li><strong>Patience:</strong> The spider works slowly and carefully. Spider Woman teaches
                that the greatest works require patience and persistence.</li>
                <li><strong>Protection:</strong> Spider Woman protects and guides, especially those on
                spiritual journeys. She offers practical help when it is needed most.</li>
                <li><strong>Thought Creates Reality:</strong> In some traditions, Spider Woman's thoughts
                become reality. This teaches the power and responsibility of thought itself.</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Navajo weavers continue to honor Spider Woman in their work, maintaining traditions
                thousands of years old</li>
                <li>The Hopi still tell the emergence stories featuring Kokyangwuti</li>
                <li>Spider imagery appears throughout Southwest indigenous art</li>
                <li>Children are taught to respect spiders as relatives of Spider Grandmother</li>

            worship are not shared publicly, and this is respected.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">When encountering Spider Woman in story or symbol, approach with reverence for the
            traditions that have preserved her teachings. Support Native artists and weavers who carry
            forward this sacred art.</p>
