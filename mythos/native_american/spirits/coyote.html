            <h2>Coyote</h2>
            <p class="subtitle" style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin: 0.5rem 0;">The Trickster, Fire-Bringer, Old Man Coyote</p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
                Coyote is one of the most important and complex figures in Native American mythology,
                appearing in the traditions of nearly every tribe west of the Mississippi River. He is
                simultaneously creator and destroyer, wise teacher and utter fool, sacred being and
                outrageous buffoon. Through his endless scheming, his spectacular failures, and his
                occasional triumphs, Coyote teaches the deepest truths about human nature, the cosmos,
                and the delicate balance between chaos and order.

            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-primary);">Tribal Traditions</h2>
            <p>Coyote appears across many nations, each with their own understanding of his nature and role:</p>

            <div class="tribal-note">
                <strong>Navajo (Dine):</strong> Ma'ii is a powerful and dangerous figure associated with
                witchcraft (skinwalkers), but also with the creation of the stars. When the Holy People
                were carefully placing stars in the sky, impatient Coyote grabbed the blanket and flung
                the remaining stars across the heavens, creating the Milky Way.
            </div>

            <div class="tribal-note">
                <strong>Crow (Apsalooke):</strong> Old Man Coyote (Isaahkawuattee) is the primary creator
                figure who made the earth, animals, and people. He shaped the landscape, taught humans
                how to live, and established the ceremonies.
            </div>

            <div class="tribal-note">
                <strong>Paiute &amp; Shoshone:</strong> Coyote is central to creation stories and is often
                depicted bringing fire to humanity by stealing it from the Fire Beings, sometimes with
                the help of other animals in a relay race.
            </div>

            <div class="tribal-note">
                <strong>Lakota:</strong> Though less central than in western traditions, Mica (Coyote)
                appears as a trickster whose stories often serve as cautionary tales about the dangers
                of greed, lust, and arrogance.
            </div>
        </section>

        <section style="margin-top: 2rem;">
            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-primary);">Major Stories &amp; Teachings</h2>
            <p>Coyote's stories are among the most numerous and varied in Native American traditions.
            Here are some of the major cycles:</p>

            <div class="story-box">
                <h3>Coyote Steals Fire</h3>
                <p>In the time before humans had fire, the Fire Beings (or Fire Spirits) jealously
                guarded it on a distant mountain. Coyote, seeing that the people were cold and suffering,
                devised a plan. He organized the animals into a relay team stretching from the mountain
                to the human village.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Coyote tricked his way into the Fire Beings' lodge and stole a burning brand,
                running with it until he was exhausted, then passing it to the next animal - sometimes
                Squirrel (whose tail was scorched, forever after curled), then Chipmunk (who got his stripes
                from the Fire Beings' claws), and so on until Frog swallowed the coal and gave it to Wood,
                where fire lives to this day.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Teaching:</strong> Great gifts often require sacrifice and cooperation.
                Coyote was burned and nearly killed, but his trickery and determination brought an essential
                gift to humanity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="story-box">
                <h3>Coyote and the Origin of Death</h3>
                <p>In many traditions, Coyote is responsible for death entering the world. In one common
                version, when the world was new, the beings debated whether death should be permanent.
                Some argued that the dead should return to life, like the moon waxing after waning.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Coyote argued that death should be permanent - "If the dead came back, there would be
                no room for the living, no reason to value life." The others reluctantly agreed. But shortly
                after, Coyote's own son died. Devastated, Coyote begged to change the rule, but it was too
                late - his own words had bound the world.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Teaching:</strong> Our actions have consequences we cannot foresee. Even the
                trickster cannot escape the laws he helps create. Death, though painful, gives meaning to life.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="story-box">
                <h3>Coyote and the Monster</h3>
                <p>In Pacific Northwest and Plateau traditions, Coyote defeats various monsters that
                threaten the people. Sometimes he allows himself to be swallowed by a great monster,
                then cuts his way out from within, freeing all the people and animals the monster had eaten.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">As he cuts up the monster's body and throws the pieces across the land, each piece
                becomes a different tribe of people, explaining how the various nations came to live where
                they do.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Teaching:</strong> Sometimes you must enter into danger, even destruction,
                to bring about liberation. The hero's journey may require being consumed before emerging
                transformed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="story-box">
                <h3>Coyote's Foolishness</h3>
                <p>Alongside his creative and heroic deeds, Coyote is famous for his spectacular failures.
                He is endlessly undone by his own appetites - for food, for sex, for admiration. He tries
                to fly like the birds (and crashes), tries to be handsome (and humiliates himself), tries
                to trick others (and is out-tricked).</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">In one famous story, Coyote sees some birds flying overhead carrying something
                delicious. He begs to join them, and they give him wings. But they warn him not to look
                down. Of course, Coyote looks down, loses his wings, and falls - but somehow survives to
                scheme another day.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Teaching:</strong> Pride and greed lead to downfall. But also: failure
                is not the end. Coyote always gets up, dusts himself off, and continues. Resilience and
                humor in the face of defeat are sacred qualities.</p>
            </div>

        <section style="margin-top: 2rem;">
            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-primary);">The Deeper Nature of Coyote</h2>
            <p>Coyote is not simply a "trickster" in the modern sense of a prankster. He embodies
            profound spiritual truths:</p>
            <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>Sacred Chaos:</strong> Coyote represents the creative chaos necessary for
                transformation. Without the trickster's disruption, the world would become rigid and lifeless.</li>
                <li><strong>The Shadow:</strong> Coyote often acts out the impulses that "civilized" beings
                repress. His stories allow communities to acknowledge and laugh at their own shadows.</li>
                <li><strong>Boundary Crosser:</strong> Coyote moves between worlds - between the sacred
                and profane, between animal and human, between creation and destruction. He is a mediator.</li>
                <li><strong>Teacher Through Failure:</strong> Coyote's failures teach more than his successes.
                We learn from his mistakes without having to make them ourselves.</li>
                <li><strong>Eternal Survival:</strong> No matter what happens to Coyote - burned, drowned,
                dismembered - he always returns. He represents the indestructible spirit of life itself.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section style="margin-top: 2rem;">
            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-primary);">Symbolism &amp; Significance</h2>
            <p>Understanding Coyote requires embracing paradox:</p>
            <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>Creator/Destroyer:</strong> Coyote makes and unmakes, often in the same story</li>
                <li><strong>Sacred/Profane:</strong> His stories include both the most holy and the most
                crude elements - often simultaneously</li>
                <li><strong>Wise/Foolish:</strong> Coyote's wisdom comes through his foolishness; his
                foolishness reveals deep wisdom</li>
                <li><strong>Survivor:</strong> Above all, Coyote survives. The actual coyote animal's
                adaptability - thriving even as other species disappear - mirrors this spiritual quality</li>
                <li><strong>The Coyote Today:</strong> Coyote remains relevant because he represents the
                irreducible, irrepressible spark of life that refuses to be tamed or extinguished</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section style="margin-top: 2rem;">
            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-primary);">Cultural Respect</h2>
            <p>Coyote stories are living traditions, still told in Native communities today. While some
            stories are shared publicly, others are restricted to certain seasons or ceremonial contexts.
            The trickster is not merely entertainment - Coyote is a spiritual teacher whose stories carry
            power and responsibility.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">When encountering Coyote in story or in life, approach with both
            humor and humility. The trickster is always teaching, often in unexpected ways.</p>
