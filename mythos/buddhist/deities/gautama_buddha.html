<h2 style="color: var(--color-primary);">Biography: The Path to Enlightenment</h2>
<h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary);">Birth and Early Life</h3>
<p>
                Born as Prince Siddhartha Gautama in Lumbini (present-day Nepal) around 563 BCE to King Suddhodana of the Shakya clan
                and Queen Maya. Seven days after his birth, his mother died, and he was raised by his maternal aunt
                Mahaprajapati Gotami.
                The sage Asita prophesied he would become either a great king (chakravartin) or a great spiritual teacher (buddha).
                His father, desiring him to be a king, surrounded him with luxury and shielded him from all suffering.
            </p>
<h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">The Four Sights</h3>
<p>
                At age 29, despite his father's efforts, Siddhartha ventured beyond the palace walls on four occasions with his
                charioteer Channa. He encountered:
            </p>
<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
<li><strong>An Old Man:</strong> Revealing the inevitability of aging</li>
<li><strong>A Sick Person:</strong> Showing the reality of disease and suffering</li>
<li><strong>A Corpse:</strong> Demonstrating the certainty of death</li>
<li><strong>A Wandering Ascetic:</strong> Displaying serene dignity despite having renounced worldly life,
                    inspiring the possibility of spiritual transcendence</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top: var(--spacing-md);">
                These "Four Sights" shattered his sheltered worldview and awakened his quest for understanding the nature
                of suffering and its cessation.
            </p>
<h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">The Great Renunciation</h3>
<p>
                On the night of his son Rahula's birth, Siddhartha made the painful decision to leave the palace.
                He cut his long hair with his sword, exchanged his royal garments for simple robes, and sent his horse
                Kanthaka back with Channa. This "Great Going Forth" (Mahābhinishkramana) marked his complete renunciation
                of worldly life at age 29.
            </p>
<h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">Years of Ascetic Practice</h3>
<p>
                For six years, Siddhartha studied with renowned teachers including
                Alara Kalama and
                Uddaka Ramaputta,
                mastering advanced meditation states. Finding these insufficient for complete liberation, he turned to
                extreme asceticism, reducing his food intake to a single grain of rice per day and practicing severe
                austerities that brought him to the brink of death. Five ascetic companions joined him in these practices.
            </p>
<h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">Enlightenment at Bodh Gaya</h3>
<p>
                Realizing that self-mortification was as futile as indulgence, Siddhartha discovered the
                Middle Way between extremes.
                He accepted milk-rice from a village woman named
                Sujata, regaining his strength.
                His five companions, thinking he had abandoned the path, left him.
            </p>
<p style="margin-top: var(--spacing-md);">
                At Bodh Gaya, he sat beneath a pipal tree (later known as the Bodhi Tree) on a grass mat offered by
                the grass-cutter Sotthiya, vowing: "Let my skin, sinews, and bones dry up, let my blood dry up,
                but I will not rise from this seat until I have attained supreme enlightenment."
            </p>
<p style="margin-top: var(--spacing-md);">
                During the night of the full moon in May (Vesak), he passed through progressively deeper states of meditation:
            </p>
<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
<li><strong>First Watch:</strong> He recalled all his previous lives across countless eons</li>
<li><strong>Second Watch:</strong> He perceived the death and rebirth of all beings according to their karma</li>
<li><strong>Third Watch:</strong> He comprehended the
                    Four Noble Truths
                    and the chain of Dependent Origination</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top: var(--spacing-md);">
                Before dawn, Mara, the demon of delusion,
                attacked with his armies and tempting daughters, attempting to prevent the awakening. Siddhartha touched
                the earth (Bhumisparsha mudra), calling the Earth Goddess
                Prithvi to witness his countless lifetimes
                of virtue. Mara was defeated.
            </p>
<p style="margin-top: var(--spacing-md);">
                At dawn, Siddhartha became the Buddha—"the Awakened One"—achieving complete liberation from suffering,
                ignorance, and the <a class="inline-search-link" href="../cosmology/samsara.html">cycle of rebirth</a>. He remained in meditation for 49 days, experiencing the bliss of
                liberation and contemplating whether to teach this profound truth.
            </p>
<h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">The First Teaching</h3>
<p>
                Initially, the Buddha hesitated to teach, thinking the Dharma too subtle for others to comprehend.
                Brahma Sahampati, lord of the gods,
                descended to request that he teach for the welfare of beings "with little dust in their eyes."
                Moved by compassion, the Buddha agreed.
            </p>
<p style="margin-top: var(--spacing-md);">
                He traveled to the Deer Park at Sarnath near Varanasi and found his five former companions.
                To them, he delivered his first sermon, the
                Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta
                (Setting in Motion the Wheel of Dharma), teaching the Middle Way, the Four Noble Truths, and the
                Noble Eightfold Path.
                Kondañña became the first to achieve
                enlightenment, exclaiming "I understand!" All five became arhats and formed the first
                Sangha (monastic community).
            </p>
<h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">45 Years of Teaching</h3>
<p>
                For 45 years, the Buddha wandered throughout the Gangetic plain teaching all who would listen—
                kings and beggars, brahmins and outcasts, men and women, monastics and laypeople. Notable events:
            </p>
<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
<li>Converted Sariputta and
                    Moggallana, who became his chief disciples</li>
<li>Ordained his son Rahula and
                    his cousin Ananda (his personal attendant)</li>
<li>After initial reluctance, established the Bhikkhuni Sangha
                    (order of nuns) for his stepmother Mahaprajapati and other women</li>
<li>Converted the mass murderer Angulimala,
                    demonstrating that even the worst criminals could be redeemed</li>
<li>Survived attempts by his jealous cousin Devadatta
                    to kill him and split the Sangha</li>
<li>Taught kings like Bimbisara and
                    Pasenadi</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">Parinirvana (Final Liberation)</h3>
<p>
                At age 80, the Buddha accepted a meal from the blacksmith
                Cunda that caused severe food poisoning.
                Despite intense pain, he insisted Cunda bore no fault—this was simply the natural time for his physical
                death. He instructed Ananda to tell Cunda his offering was of great merit, as it preceded the Buddha's
                final liberation.
            </p>
<p style="margin-top: var(--spacing-md);">
                He traveled to Kushinagar and lay down between two sal trees in the "lion's posture" (lying on his right side).
                Surrounded by grieving disciples and gods, he gave final instructions:
            </p>
<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
<li>"All conditioned things are subject to decay. Strive with diligence!" (vayadhammā saṅkhārā appamādena sampādetha)</li>
<li>"Be a lamp unto yourselves. Be a refuge unto yourselves. Take the Dharma as your lamp and refuge."</li>
<li>After his death, the Sangha should follow the Dharma and Vinaya (monastic code) as their teacher</li>
<li>Minor rules of the Vinaya could be amended if the Sangha agreed</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top: var(--spacing-md);">
                He passed through the jhanas (meditative absorptions) in ascending and descending order, finally entering
                parinirvana—complete extinction of the fires of greed, hatred, and delusion. The earth shook, and the gods wept.
            </p>
<p style="margin-top: var(--spacing-md);">
                His body was cremated with royal honors. His relics were divided into eight portions and enshrined in stupas
                throughout India, becoming objects of veneration and pilgrimage.

<h2 style="color: var(--color-primary);">Core Teachings</h2>
<h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary);">The Four Noble Truths</h3>
<p>The foundation of all Buddhist teaching, realized during the Buddha's enlightenment:</p>
<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
<li><strong>Dukkha (Suffering):</strong> Life involves suffering—birth, aging, sickness, death,
                    separation from loved ones, contact with the unloved, not obtaining desires. The five aggregates
                    (form, feeling, perception, mental formations, consciousness) subject to clinging are suffering.</li>
<li><strong>Samudaya (Origin):</strong> Suffering arises from craving (taṇhā)—desire for sensual pleasures,
                    desire for existence, desire for non-existence. This craving, combined with ignorance, binds beings
                    to the wheel of <a class="inline-search-link" href="../cosmology/samsara.html">Samsara</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Nirodha (Cessation):</strong> Suffering can end completely.
                    Nirvana is the cessation of
                    craving and the liberation from cyclic existence.</li>
<li><strong>Magga (Path):</strong> The Noble Eightfold Path
                    leads to the cessation of suffering.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">Three Marks of Existence (Tilakkhana)</h3>
<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
<li><strong>Anicca (Impermanence):</strong> All conditioned phenomena are in constant flux</li>
<li><strong>Dukkha (Unsatisfactoriness):</strong> All conditioned phenomena are ultimately unsatisfying due to impermanence</li>
<li><strong>Anatta (Non-self):</strong> No permanent, unchanging self exists within or outside the five aggregates</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">Dependent Origination (Paticca-samuppada)</h3>
<p>The Buddha's profound insight into causality, showing how suffering arises and ceases through a chain of 12 links.
