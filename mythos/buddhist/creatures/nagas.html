Seeing dark storm clouds gathering, Mucalinda emerged from his abode and coiled his body seven times around <a class="inline-search-link" href="../deities/gautama_buddha.html">the Buddha</a> to shield him from the cold wind and rain. He spread his great hood over <a class="inline-search-link" href="../deities/gautama_buddha.html">the Buddha</a>'s head like an umbrella. For seven days the naga protected the Blessed One while he sat in meditation experiencing the bliss of liberation. When the storm passed, Mucalinda uncoiled himself, transformed into a beautiful youth, and paid homage to <a class="inline-search-link" href="../deities/gautama_buddha.html">the Buddha</a> with joined palms."

                        "In a former life, the Bodhisattva was born as Bhuridatta, a naga prince. To accumulate merit, he would take human form and observe the precepts. Each fortnight he would lie on an anthill in serpent form, vowing not to move even if attacked, as an exercise in perfect patience. A snake charmer captured him and forced him to perform for crowds. Though possessing the power to kill his captor with a breath, Bhuridatta endured humiliation to maintain his vow. Eventually a prince recognized his noble nature and freed him. This tale teaches that even nagas—powerful, wrathful beings—can practice perfect virtue."

                        "Monks, there are four kinds of nagas: egg-born nagas, womb-born nagas, moisture-born nagas, and transformation-born nagas. The egg-born are the lowest in power. The transformation-born are the highest, dwelling in celestial palaces. Some nagas observe the precepts and are reborn in higher realms. Others, blinded by anger and attachment to their treasures, remain bound to the naga realm for many lifetimes. A naga suffers from five fears: garuda birds who prey upon them, extreme heat drying their water homes, humans polluting their dwelling places, being captured by charmers, and other nagas attacking them."

She understood the deepest Dharma. The bodhisattva Wisdom Accumulated said: 'I do not believe this dragon girl could attain perfect enlightenment so quickly. A woman's body has five obstacles—she cannot become Brahma, Indra, Mara, a wheel-turning king, or a Buddha.' The dragon girl took a priceless jewel and offered it to <a class="inline-search-link" href="../deities/gautama_buddha.html">the Buddha</a>. In the time it took to accept the jewel, she transformed her female form, instantly became a bodhisattva, and proceeded to the southern world to sit on a jeweled lotus and attain complete perfect enlightenment."

                        "When Guru Padmasambhava came to Tibet to establish Buddhism, the local nagas resisted, creating storms and earthquakes to prevent construction of Samye Monastery. Padmasambhava entered deep meditation and projected himself to the underwater palace of the naga king. There he displayed supernatural powers, taking wrathful form to subdue the nagas. But he also taught them Dharma, showing the path to liberation from their long-lived but suffering existence. The nagas took vows to protect the Dharma in Tibet. To this day, Tibetans make offerings to 'lu' (nagas) at sacred lakes and springs, maintaining the ancient compact."
