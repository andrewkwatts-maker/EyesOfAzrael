<p>Chinese emperor who built hundreds of temples, ordained himself as a monk multiple times, banned

<h2 style="color: var(--color-primary);">Themes in Buddhist Hagiography</h2>
<div class="card">
<h3>From Ordinary to Extraordinary</h3>
<p>Buddhist saints often begin as ordinary people—criminals, woodcutters, kings, householders—demonstrating
                   that enlightenment is accessible regardless of station. The key is hearing the dharma, recognizing its
                   truth, and practicing with dedication.</p>
</div>
<div class="card">
<h3>Transformation Through Practice</h3>
<p>Many saints undergo dramatic transformations—murderers become compassionate teachers, kings renounce
                   power, scholars abandon conceptual understanding for direct realization. This emphasizes that past
                   karma doesn't determine future—present effort creates the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="card">
<h3>Supernatural Powers as Side Effects</h3>
<p>While many saints develop miraculous abilities (flying, reading minds, visiting other realms), these
                   are presented as mere side effects of deep meditation, not the goal. <a class="inline-search-link" href="../deities/gautama_buddha.html">The Buddha</a> warned against using
                   powers to impress, as they can become obstacles to liberation.</p>

<h3>Diverse Paths to the Same Goal</h3>
<p>Buddhist heroes demonstrate multiple valid approaches—ascetic discipline, scholarship, devotion,
                   meditation, service, tantric practice—all leading to the same enlightenment. This reflects Buddhism's
                   emphasis on skillful means adapted to individual capacity.</p>
