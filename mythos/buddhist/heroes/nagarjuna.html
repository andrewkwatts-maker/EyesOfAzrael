<h2>Nagarjuna (नागार्जुन / ཀླུ་སྒྲུབ།)</h2>
<p class="subtitle" style="font-size: var(--font-size-2xl); margin: 0.5rem 0;">The Second Buddha, Founder of Madhyamaka Philosophy</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-top: var(--spacing-md);">
Nagarjuna (c. 150-250 CE) is one of the most important philosophers in Buddhist history, founding the
                Madhyamaka (Middle Way) school that became the
                philosophical foundation of Mahayana Buddhism.
                His revolutionary teachings on emptiness
                (shunyata) and his masterwork, the <em>Mulamadhyamakakarika</em>, profoundly influenced all subsequent Buddhist
                thought. Considered an emanation of <a class="inline-search-link" href="../deities/manjushri.html">Manjushri</a>,
                he is revered as the "Second Buddha" for reviving and clarifying <a class="inline-search-link" href="../deities/gautama_buddha.html">the Buddha</a>'s teachings.

<h2 style="color: var(--color-primary);">Biography and Legends</h2>
<h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary);">Early Life and Conversion</h3>
<p>
                Born in South India to a Brahmin family, Nagarjuna received extensive education in the Vedas and sciences.
                According to tradition, as a youth he mastered the art of invisibility, which he and three friends used to
                enter the king's harem. When his friends were caught and executed, Nagarjuna realized that lust leads to
                suffering and death. This traumatic lesson motivated his spiritual seeking.
            </p>
<p style="margin-top: var(--spacing-md);">
                He became a Buddhist monk and within 90 days had memorized the entire Tripitaka
                (the three baskets of Buddhist scripture). Finding nothing further to learn, he was about to disrobe when an
                old monk revealed deeper teachings existed. Nagarjuna traveled throughout India seeking them.
            </p>
<h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">The <a class="inline-search-link" href="../creatures/nagas.html">Nagas</a>' Treasury</h3>
<p>
                His name "Nagarjuna" (Naga-arjuna) means "noble serpent," derived from the legend of his encounter with the
                <a class="inline-search-link" href="../creatures/nagas.html">nagas</a> (serpent deities). According to tradition,
                the <a class="inline-search-link" href="../creatures/nagas.html">nagas</a> invited him to their underwater palace and presented him with the
                Prajnaparamita Sutras
                (Perfection of Wisdom texts), which the <a class="inline-search-link" href="../deities/gautama_buddha.html">Buddha</a>
                had taught but the world was not ready to receive. The <a class="inline-search-link" href="../creatures/nagas.html">nagas</a> had preserved these profound teachings for 500 years
                until a worthy master appeared. Nagarjuna brought these sutras back to the human world, establishing the
                philosophical foundation of Mahayana Buddhism.
            </p>
<h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">Life as a Teacher and Alchemist</h3>
<p>
                He became abbot of the great monastery at Nalanda and served as spiritual advisor to the Satavahana king.
                Historical sources describe him as:
            </p>
<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
<li>Philosopher who defeated non-Buddhist scholars in debate, converting them to the Dharma</li>
<li>Alchemist who transmitted rasayana
                    (rejuvenation) practices, earning him association with both Buddhist and Hindu tantric traditions</li>
<li>Compassionate teacher who emptied the royal treasury to feed the poor during famine</li>
<li>Author of numerous texts on philosophy, ethics, medicine, and statecraft</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">Death and Legacy</h3>
<p>
                According to legend, Nagarjuna achieved such mastery of alchemy and meditation that he became immortal.
                However, a prince destined to become a great king could not ascend the throne while Nagarjuna lived.
                Recognizing this karmic situation, Nagarjuna compassionately offered his life. The prince used a blade of
                kusha grass to cut Nagarjuna's neck—the only substance that could harm him, as he had once accidentally
                killed an ant with such grass. His body is said to have transformed into light, and prophecies state he
                will be reborn as the future Buddha maitreya's
                chief disciple.

<h2 style="color: var(--color-primary);">Core Philosophical Contributions</h2>
<h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary);">The Middle Way (Madhyamaka)</h3>
<p>
Nagarjuna's philosophy navigates between two extremes:
            </p>
<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
<li><strong>Eternalism:</strong> The view that things have inherent, permanent existence</li>
<li><strong>Nihilism:</strong> The view that nothing exists at all</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top: var(--spacing-md);">
                His middle way: Things exist conventionally but lack inherent existence. They arise through
                dependent_origination,
                exist relationally, and are therefore empty of independent self-nature.
            </p>
<h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">The Two Truths</h3>
<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
<li><strong>Conventional Truth (samvrti-satya):</strong> The everyday world of causes and effects, where things
                    function, where ethical distinctions matter, where practice occurs</li>
<li><strong>Ultimate Truth (paramartha-satya):</strong> The empty nature of all phenomena, their lack of
                    inherent existence, the inexpressible nature that transcends conceptual elaboration</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top: var(--spacing-md);">
                These are not contradictory but complementary—two ways of seeing the same reality. Understanding their relationship
                is essential for Buddhist practice.
            </p>
<h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">The Tetralemma (Catuskoti)</h3>
<p>
Nagarjuna's distinctive logical tool examines four possible positions and negates all four:
            </p>
<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
<li>It is not X (negation of existence)</li>
<li>It is not not-X (negation of non-existence)</li>
<li>It is not both X and not-X (negation of both)</li>
<li>It is not neither X nor not-X (negation of neither)</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top: var(--spacing-md);">
                This exhausts all conceptual possibilities, pointing to a reality beyond conceptual elaboration.
            </p>
