    <p class="subtitle" style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin: 0.5rem 0;">The Rice Bearer - God of Prosperity, Foxes, and Abundance</p>
    <p class="hero-description">Inari is one of the most popular and widely worshipped kami in Japan, with more than 30,000 shrines - more than any other deity. As the god of rice, agriculture, foxes, fertility, tea, sake, and general prosperity, Inari touches nearly every aspect of Japanese life and economy. Gender-fluid and multifaceted, appearing sometimes as male, sometimes as female, sometimes as androgynous, Inari embodies the productive forces of nature and the wealth they bring. White foxes (kitsune) serve as Inari's messengers and representatives, making fox statues a ubiquitous sight at Inari shrines across Japan.</p>

<section style="margin-top: 2rem;">
    <h2 style="color: var(--color-primary);">The Kitsune - Fox Messengers</h2>
    <p>Inari's most distinctive feature is the association with foxes (kitsune), particularly white foxes. These supernatural foxes serve as Inari's messengers (shinshi) and representatives, possessing magical powers including shapeshifting, creating illusions, and carrying messages between the kami and humans. The relationship is so strong that many people confuse the messenger (fox) with the deity itself, though Inari is the kami and the foxes are servants.</p>

    <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">Fox Symbolism:</h3>
    <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
        <li><strong>White Foxes:</strong> Divine or celestial foxes with pure hearts serving Inari. The white color represents purity and divine status, distinguishing them from ordinary foxes.</li>
        <li><strong>Fox Statues (Komainu):</strong> Pairs of fox statues flank Inari shrine entrances, typically holding symbolic objects - rice sheaves, keys, jewels, or scrolls in their mouths or under their paws.</li>
        <li><strong>Rice Granary Guardians:</strong> Foxes were historically seen as protectors of rice granaries because they hunt rats and mice that would otherwise eat stored grain, making them practical as well as symbolic guardians.</li>
        <li><strong>Intelligence & Magic:</strong> Kitsune represent cleverness, wisdom, and supernatural power. The longer a fox lives, the more tails it grows and the more powerful it becomes (up to nine tails).</li>
        <li><strong>Shapeshifters:</strong> Fox spirits can transform into human form, especially beautiful women, and this shapeshifting ability links them to transformation and change - essential agricultural concepts (seed to plant, harvest to food).</li>
    </ul>

<section style="margin-top: 2rem;">
    <h2 style="color: var(--color-primary);">Origins & Mythology</h2>
    <p>Unlike many Shinto kami, Inari does not feature prominently in the ancient chronicles (Kojiki and Nihon Shoki). Instead, Inari's worship emerged organically from agricultural communities and was later systematized and incorporated into official Shinto. The deity's origins are mysterious and multifaceted.</p>

    <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">Possible Origins:</h3>
    <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
        <li><strong>Agricultural Deity:</strong> Likely originated as a local agricultural kami worshipped by farming communities dependent on rice cultivation. The name "Inari" directly relates to rice growing/ripening.</li>
        <li><strong>Syncretism:</strong> May be a syncretic fusion of multiple earlier rice and fertility deities including Uke-Mochi (killed by Tsukuyomi, from whose body came rice), Toyouke-Hime, or Ukanomitama-no-Kami.</li>
        <li><strong>Hata Clan Origins:</strong> Tradition associates Inari worship with the Hata clan, Korean immigrants who brought advanced agricultural and silk production techniques to Japan in the 5th-6th centuries.</li>
        <li><strong>Mountain Deity:</strong> Fushimi Inari (the head shrine) sits on Mount Inari, suggesting possible origins as a mountain kami who descended to bless the rice fields in the valleys.</li>
        <li><strong>Buddhist Influence:</strong> During the medieval period, Inari was sometimes identified with Buddhist figures, especially Dakini-ten (a tantric deity), adding layers of complexity and esoteric meaning.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">Foundation Legend:</h3>
    <p>According to shrine tradition, in 711 CE, the founding deity descended onto Mount Inari in Fushimi (near Kyoto) when the ancestor of the Hata clan shot an arrow at a rice cake (mochi). The rice cake transformed into a white bird that flew to the mountain peak. Rice grew where the bird landed, giving the mountain its name "Inari" and establishing it as a sacred site. This myth connects Inari directly to rice cultivation and agricultural abundance.</p>

<section style="margin-top: 2rem;">
    <h2 style="color: var(--color-primary);">Worship & Sacred Sites</h2>

    <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary);">Fushimi Inari-taisha (Head Shrine)</h3>
    <p>The most important Inari shrine is Fushimi Inari-taisha in Kyoto, established in 711 CE. Famous for its thousands of vermillion torii gates forming tunnels up the mountain, it receives millions of visitors annually - particularly on New Year's Day when it's among the most visited shrines in Japan. The shrine complex spreads across Mount Inari with countless sub-shrines, fox statues, and offerings along the mountain trails.</p>

    <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1rem;">30,000+ Shrines</h3>
    <p>Inari has more shrines than any other kami in Japan - over 30,000 (approximately one-third of all Shinto shrines). They range from grand shrine complexes to tiny roadside shrines to small altars in businesses and homes. This ubiquity reflects Inari's importance in daily Japanese life and economic activity.</p>

    <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1rem;">Distinctive Features:</h3>
    <ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
        <li><strong>Red Torii Gates:</strong> Vermillion torii gates (often in long tunnels or rows) mark Inari shrines. Donors contribute these gates as offerings when wishes are granted.</li>
        <li><strong>Fox Statues:</strong> Pairs of fox guardians (sometimes holding rice, keys, or jewels) flank shrine entrances and dot the grounds.</li>
        <li><strong>Mountain Location:</strong> Many Inari shrines sit on or near mountains, with pilgrimage paths marked by countless torii gates.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Shrines:</strong> Small Inari shrines appear on rooftops and in businesses, especially in merchant districts, seeking prosperity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1rem;">Festivals</h3>
    <ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 2rem;">
        <li><strong>Hatsu-Uma Festival (First Horse Day):</strong> Held on the first horse day of February (Inari's traditional descent date), this is the most important Inari festival celebrating the kami's blessing of crops.</li>
        <li><strong>Inari Matsuri:</strong> Various local festivals throughout the year, especially at planting and harvest times.</li>
        <li><strong>New Year (Shogatsu):</strong> Inari shrines receive massive crowds seeking blessings for prosperity in the coming year.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1rem;">Worship Practices</h3>
    <p>Worshippers offer rice, sake, aburaage (fried tofu - supposedly foxes' favorite food), and candles. Business owners and merchants particularly venerate Inari, dedicating small shrines in their establishments and making offerings for commercial success. The practice of donating torii gates when wishes are granted creates the famous gate tunnels. Prayers request agricultural abundance, business success, fertility, and general prosperity.</p>

<section style="margin-top: 2rem;">
    <h2 style="color: var(--color-primary);">Cultural Significance</h2>

    <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary);">Economic & Commercial Importance</h3>
    <p>Inari evolved from a purely agricultural deity to become the patron of commerce, business, and worldly prosperity. As Japan modernized and urbanized, Inari worship adapted - merchants, craftspeople, and later corporations embraced Inari as a deity of success and profit. Modern business shrines often feature Inari, and companies may have Inari altars seeking commercial blessings.</p>

    <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1rem;">Gender Fluidity</h3>
    <p>Inari's gender fluidity is notable in Japanese mythology. The kami appears as male in some traditions, female in others, and androgynous or beyond gender in still others. This flexibility reflects the deity's connection to fertility and generation - forces that transcend binary gender categories. Different shrine traditions emphasize different aspects, but the ambiguity is considered natural rather than problematic.</p>

    <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1rem;">Popular Culture</h3>
    <p>Inari and kitsune appear throughout Japanese popular culture - anime, manga, video games, and films frequently feature fox spirits and Inari shrines. The iconic image of red torii gate tunnels (especially at Fushimi Inari) has become globally recognizable as a symbol of Japan itself. The mysterious, magical nature of fox spirits makes them endlessly fascinating in storytelling.</p>

    <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1rem;">Modern Worship</h3>
    <p>Inari remains one of the most actively worshipped kami in contemporary Japan. Unlike some ancient gods whose worship declined, Inari's relevance has persisted and adapted. The deity's association with success, prosperity, and abundance resonates in modern contexts - from students seeking academic success to entrepreneurs seeking business blessings. The 30,000+ shrines testify to Inari's enduring importance in Japanese spiritual and economic life.</p>
