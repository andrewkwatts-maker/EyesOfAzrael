    <h2 style="color: var(--color-primary);">Mythology &amp; Historical Development</h2>
    <p>Hachiman's mythology is unique in Japanese religion as it developed through the historical deification of Emperor Ojin and the syncretism of Shinto and Buddhist traditions. His worship evolved from local guardian deity to national protector over many centuries.</p>

    <h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">Origins &amp; Key Stories:</h3>
    <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
        <li><strong>Deification of Emperor Ojin:</strong> Emperor Ojin, who reigned in the late 3rd to early 4th century (traditional dates 270-310 CE), was renowned as a strong ruler who expanded Japanese territory and promoted archery and military arts. After his death, he was enshrined at Usa (modern Oita Prefecture, Kyushu) and gradually came to be worshipped as a kami. By the 8th century, he was fully identified as the deity Hachiman, with his name possibly deriving from "Yahata" (Eight Banners), referring to eight divine banners that appeared at his birth or to his eight sons who became regional protectors.</li>

        <li><strong>The Oracle of Usa:</strong> In 749 CE, during the construction of the Great Buddha (Daibutsu) at Todai-ji Temple in Nara, the imperial court consulted the oracle of Hachiman at Usa Shrine. The deity pronounced his approval and protection for this Buddhist project, marking a pivotal moment in Shinto-Buddhist syncretism. Hachiman was declared a "Great Bodhisattva" (Daibosatsu), becoming the first kami to receive a Buddhist title. This established his dual nature as both Shinto kami and Buddhist protector deity.</li>

        <li><strong>Protection of the Capital:</strong> In 860 CE, Hachiman was enshrined at Iwashimizu Hachimangu (near Kyoto) to protect the imperial capital from evil and invasion. His position as guardian of the nation was thus formalized, and he became intimately connected with the defense of Japan and the legitimacy of imperial rule.</li>

        <li><strong>Patron of the Minamoto Clan:</strong> The powerful Minamoto (Genji) warrior clan adopted Hachiman as their tutelary deity in the 11th-12th centuries. Minamoto no Yoshiie, known as "Hachiman Taro" (Firstborn Son of Hachiman), claimed divine descent from the war god and credited his victories to Hachiman's protection. When Minamoto no Yoritomo established the Kamakura Shogunate in 1185, he built Tsurugaoka Hachimangu shrine, elevating Hachiman to supreme status as patron of the samurai class.</li>

        <li><strong>The Divine Wind (Kamikaze):</strong> During the Mongol invasions of Japan (1274 and 1281), typhoons destroyed the Mongol fleets before they could fully invade. These storms were attributed to Hachiman's divine intervention and called "kamikaze" (divine wind). This cemented Hachiman's reputation as Japan's ultimate protector against foreign threats.</li>

        <li><strong>Symbol of Righteous War:</strong> Unlike some war gods who embody bloodlust and chaos, Hachiman represents the disciplined, honorable warrior. He is invoked not for conquest but for protection, for just causes, and for the discipline required in martial arts. Samurai prayed to him before battle, seeking not just victory but the courage and honor to fight well and die honorably if necessary.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="color: var(--color-primary);">Worship &amp; Sacred Sites</h2>

    <h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary);">The Three Great Hachiman Shrines</h3>
    <p>Hachiman is worshipped at over 40,000 shrines throughout Japan, making him one of the most widely venerated deities. The three most important are:</p>

    <ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 2rem;">
        <li><strong>Usa Jingu (Oita Prefecture, Kyushu):</strong> The original and head shrine of all Hachiman worship, founded in 725 CE. This is where Emperor Ojin was first enshrined and where the famous oracle approving the Great Buddha was delivered. The shrine complex features unique architecture and is considered the birthplace of the Hachiman cult.</li>

        <li><strong>Iwashimizu Hachimangu (Yawata City, Kyoto Prefecture):</strong> Established in 860 CE to protect the imperial capital. Second in importance only to Usa, this shrine served as the spiritual guardian of Kyoto and the imperial court throughout the Heian period. Its elevated position on Mount Otokoyama symbolizes watching over the nation.</li>

        <li><strong>Tsurugaoka Hachimangu (Kamakura, Kanagawa Prefecture):</strong> Founded in 1063 and greatly expanded by Minamoto no Yoritomo in 1180. This shrine served as the religious and political center of the Kamakura Shogunate (1185-1333), firmly establishing Hachiman as the patron deity of the samurai class. The impressive avenue approach lined with cherry trees remains one of Japan's most iconic shrine approaches.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary); margin-top: 1rem;">Other Major Shrines</h3>
    <ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 2rem;">
        <li><strong>Hakozaki Hachimangu (Fukuoka):</strong> Famous for its association with the Mongol invasions</li>
        <li><strong>Omi Jingu (Shiga):</strong> Dedicated to Emperor Tenji with Hachiman associations</li>
        <li><strong>Countless local shrines:</strong> Nearly every region of Japan has at least one Hachiman shrine, often protecting villages, towns, and military installations</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary); margin-top: 1rem;">Festivals &amp; Observances</h3>
    <ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 2rem;">
        <li><strong>Reitaisai (Annual Grand Festival):</strong> Varies by shrine but typically in September, featuring processions, archery demonstrations, and mikoshi (portable shrine) parades</li>
        <li><strong>Yabusame:</strong> Mounted archery ceremonies performed at major Hachiman shrines, demonstrating samurai martial skills</li>
        <li><strong>Hojo-e (Liberation of Living Beings):</strong> A Buddhist-influenced ritual releasing captive animals, reflecting Hachiman's Buddhist aspects</li>
        <li><strong>Coming-of-age ceremonies:</strong> Young people and especially martial artists visit Hachiman shrines to pray for strength and success</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary); margin-top: 1rem;">Worship Practices</h3>
    <p>Worship of Hachiman emphasizes honor, discipline, courage, and protection of the community. Warriors historically prayed to him before battle, seeking not bloodlust but the moral strength to fight honorably. Offerings include sake, rice, weapons (symbolically), and white doves (which may be released). Martial artists, especially those practicing kyudo (archery), kendo (swordsmanship), and other budo (martial ways), continue to seek Hachiman's blessings for discipline and skill. In modern times, he is also invoked for protection, success in endeavors requiring courage, and for the nation's safety. The white dove, paradoxically a symbol of peace, represents Hachiman's deeper meaning: strength in service of peace, war only when necessary, and the warrior's ultimate goal of protecting harmony.</p>
