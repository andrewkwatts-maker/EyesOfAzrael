     The Male Who Invites - Progenitor of the Gods
    </p>
    <p class="hero-description">
     The primordial creator deity who, together with his divine consort Izanami, stirred the cosmic ocean to create the islands of Japan and gave birth to the myriad kami. His mythology encompasses the grandest themes: creation, love, death, loss, and rebirth. From his union with Izanami came the land itself; from his tears came grief; from his purification came the three most noble kami - Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi, and Susanoo. He is both the beginning of all things and the first to experience their ending.

     Mythology &amp; Stories
    </h2>
    <p>
     Izanagi's myths are the foundational narratives of Shinto cosmology. His story is one of cosmic creation followed by devastating personal loss, ultimately transformed through ritual purification into new creation. These myths establish core Shinto concepts: the sacredness of land, the power of purification, and the separation between the living and the dead.
    </p>
    <h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">
     The Creation of Japan (Kuniumi):
    </h3>
    <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
     <li>
      <strong>
       The Heavenly Command:
      </strong>
      The primordial kami of the High Plain of Heaven commanded Izanagi and Izanami to solidify and give birth to the drifting land below. They descended to the Floating Bridge of Heaven (Ama-no-Ukihashi), bearing the Heavenly Jeweled Spear (Ama-no-Nuboko).
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Stirring the Cosmic Ocean:
      </strong>
      Standing on the bridge, Izanagi and Izanami thrust the jeweled spear into the chaotic waters below and stirred. When they lifted the spear, brine dripped from its tip and accumulated to form Onogoro Island - the first solid land, the "self-coagulating island."
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       The Sacred Marriage Pillar:
      </strong>
      Descending to Onogoro, they erected the Heavenly August Pillar (Ama-no-Mihashira) and built a palace. To consummate their divine marriage, they walked around the pillar in opposite directions - Izanami from the right, Izanagi from the left. When they met, Izanami spoke first in greeting. Their first child, Hiruko (the leech-child), was born deformed and was placed in a reed boat and set adrift - punishment for Izanami having spoken first, violating proper order.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       The Correct Ritual:
      </strong>
      They consulted the heavenly kami and repeated the ritual, this time with Izanagi speaking first. The proper order established, they gave birth to the eight great islands of Japan (Awaji, Iyo, Oki, Tsukushi, Iki, Tsushima, Sado, and Yamato) and then numerous smaller islands, creating the Japanese archipelago.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">
     The Birth of the Kami (Kamiumi):
    </h3>
    <p>
     After creating the land, Izanagi and Izanami gave birth to numerous kami governing all aspects of the world - gods of sea, wind, trees, mountains, rivers, and plains. Their creative union produced the divine framework of nature itself. However, when Izanami gave birth to Kagutsuchi, the fire god, his flames burned her. Despite Izanagi's grief and care, she died from her injuries - the first death among the kami. In his rage and sorrow, Izanagi beheaded Kagutsuchi with his sword Totsuka, and from the fire god's blood and body sprang yet more kami, including thunder gods and mountain deities.
    </p>
    <h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">
     The Descent to Yomi:
    </h3>
    <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
     <li>
      <strong>
       The Journey Underground:
      </strong>
      Unable to accept Izanami's death, Izanagi descended to Yomi-no-Kuni (the Land of the Dead) to bring her back. In the darkness, he called out to her. Izanami replied from the shadows: she had already eaten the food of Yomi and could not easily return. She would petition the gods of the underworld but commanded Izanagi not to look upon her.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       The Forbidden Sight:
      </strong>
      Growing impatient, Izanagi broke a tooth from his comb, lit it as a torch, and gazed upon his wife. He saw her corpse crawling with maggots, her body rotting, eight thunder kami born from her decay. The polluted Izanami, shamed and enraged, sent the Shikome (Hags of Yomi) and the thunder gods to pursue him.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       The Chase from Yomi:
      </strong>
      Izanagi fled, throwing obstacles behind him. His headdress became grapes; his comb teeth became bamboo shoots - diversions for his pursuers. At the slope of Yomi (Yomotsu Hirasaka), he found three peaches and threw them at the army of the dead, driving them back. Finally, Izanami herself pursued him. At the boundary between worlds, Izanagi rolled a massive boulder across the entrance, sealing Yomi forever.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       The Divorce of the Dead:
      </strong>
      From opposite sides of the boulder, husband and wife spoke their final words. Izanami declared she would kill one thousand people of his land each day. Izanagi replied he would then ensure one thousand five hundred were born each day. Thus death entered the world, but life would always exceed it. Their marriage was dissolved - the first divorce.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">
     The Great Purification (Misogi):
    </h3>
    <p>
     Polluted by his contact with death and the underworld, Izanagi traveled to the river mouth of Tachibana in Himuka (modern Miyazaki Prefecture) to purify himself. As he stripped off his garments and ornaments, various kami were born from each item. As he washed in the water, deities of pollution and purification arose. Finally, washing his face produced the three most noble kami:
     <a href="amaterasu.html">
      Amaterasu
     </a>
     from his left eye,
     <a href="tsukuyomi.html">
      Tsukuyomi
     </a>
     from his right eye, and
     <a href="susanoo.html">
      Susanoo
     </a>
     from his nose. This misogi ritual established the fundamental Shinto practice of purification through water.

     The Heavenly Jeweled Spear (Ama-no-Nuboko)
    </h3>
    <p>
     This divine spear was given to Izanagi and Izanami by the primordial kami to create the world. By stirring the chaotic ocean with this jeweled weapon, they gathered matter to form the first land. The spear represents the masculine creative principle and the power of heaven to give form to formless chaos. Some traditions identify it with the sacred spear enshrined at Taga Taisha.
    </p>
    <h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary); margin-top: 1rem;">
     Totsuka-no-Tsurugi (Ten-Span Sword)
    </h3>
    <p>
     Izanagi used this sword to slay Kagutsuchi, the fire god who had killed Izanami. From Kagutsuchi's blood dripping from the blade and his body parts came numerous powerful kami, including various thunder gods. This myth establishes the sword as both destroyer and creator - ending one form of divine life while generating others.
    </p>
    <h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary); margin-top: 1rem;">
     The Boulder of Yomotsu Hirasaka
    </h3>
    <p>
     The massive boulder (Chibiki-no-Iwa or Yomotsu-Oho-Kami, "Great God of Yomi") that Izanagi used to seal the entrance to Yomi represents the permanent barrier between the living and the dead. Some traditions identify this site with actual locations in Shimane Prefecture, where shrines mark the legendary boundary.

    <p>
     Izanagi is primarily invoked in the context of purification, creation, and new beginnings. His example established misogi (water purification) as the fundamental Shinto practice for removing pollution and restoring spiritual cleanliness. Couples may pray to Izanagi (and Izanami together) for fertility, creative endeavors, and harmonious marriage - though the awareness of their ultimate separation adds complexity to such prayers. His mythology also makes him significant for those dealing with grief and loss, as he was the first to experience the death of a loved one.

     Theological Significance
    </h2>
    <p>
     Izanagi's mythology establishes several foundational Shinto concepts:
    </p>
    <ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 2rem;">
     <li>
      <strong>
       Purification (Harae):
      </strong>
      His misogi ritual is the prototype for all Shinto purification practices
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Pollution (Kegare):
      </strong>
      Contact with death creates pollution that must be cleansed
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       The Separation of Life and Death:
      </strong>
      Yomi and the living world are permanently divided
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Proper Ritual Order:
      </strong>
      The Hiruko incident shows that correct procedure matters in divine ritual
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Life Exceeding Death:
      </strong>
      His declaration that births will outnumber deaths establishes cosmic optimism
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       The Sacred Land:
      </strong>
      Japan itself is the offspring of divine beings, making the land inherently sacred
