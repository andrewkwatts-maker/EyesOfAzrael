<p><a class="corpus-link" data-term="Hanuman" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=hanuman" title="Search corpus for 'Hanuman'">Hanuman</a> is central to the Ramayana epic and has become one of Hinduism's most worshipped deities. Unlike most gods who are worshipped for granting boons, Hanuman is revered for his character - his absolute devotion, his humility despite possessing godlike powers, his courage in the face of any danger, and his selfless service. He represents the ideal devotee who has no ego, no personal desires, existing only to serve his beloved lord. His worship transcends sectarian boundaries - both Vaishnavas and Shaivas revere him, and he is invoked by people of all backgrounds for strength, courage, and protection.</p>

<h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">Key <a data-term="Myths" data-tradition="hindu" class="corpus-link" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=myths" title="View myths in ancient texts">Myths</a> &amp; Exploits:</h3>
<ul style="margin: 1rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
<li><strong>Divine Birth:</strong> <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Hanuman" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=hanuman" title="Search corpus for 'Hanuman'">Hanuman</a> was born to Anjana (an apsara cursed to be born as a vanara) and Kesari (a vanara king), but his true father was Vayu, the wind god. When Anjana prayed intensely to <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Shiva" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=shiva" title="Search corpus for 'Shiva'">Shiva</a> for a child, the wind god Vayu carried the divine essence to her womb. Thus Hanuman is considered an avatar or son of <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Shiva" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=shiva" title="Search corpus for 'Shiva'">Shiva</a> in some traditions, and son of Vayu in all traditions. He was born with incredible strength and supernatural abilities, an auspicious birth foretold to be crucial for dharma's victory.</li>

<li><strong>Swallowing the Sun:</strong> As a child, <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Hanuman" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=hanuman" title="Search corpus for 'Hanuman'">Hanuman</a> was mischievous and unaware of his divine nature. Seeing the rising sun, he mistook it for a ripe fruit and leaped into the sky to eat it. <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Indra" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=indra" title="Search corpus for 'Indra'">Indra</a>, seeing this threat to cosmic order, struck the child with his thunderbolt, injuring Hanuman's jaw (hence his name, which can mean "one with a broken jaw"). Enraged, Vayu withdrew all air from the world, suffocating all beings. The gods quickly apologized and granted young Hanuman numerous boons: immortality from <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Brahma" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=brahma" title="Search corpus for 'Brahma'">Brahma</a>, invulnerability in battle from <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Indra" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=indra" title="Search corpus for 'Indra'">Indra</a>, and various powers from other deities. However, due to his mischief, he was cursed to forget his powers until reminded of them at the right time.</li>

<li><strong>Meeting Rama - The Purpose Revealed:</strong> When <a class="inline-search-link" href="../heroes/rama.html">Rama</a> and Lakshmana searched for the abducted Sita, they met <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Hanuman" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=hanuman" title="Search corpus for 'Hanuman'">Hanuman</a> on Mount Rishyamukha. The moment Hanuman beheld Rama, his life found its purpose. He instantly recognized him as his lord and master, and devoted himself completely to Rama's service. This meeting represents the soul (Hanuman) recognizing the divine (Rama) and surrendering completely. From this moment, Hanuman existed only to serve Rama, finding in this service his ultimate fulfillment.</li>

<li><strong>The Leap to Lanka:</strong> When no one could cross the vast ocean to Lanka to find Sita, the vanaras despaired. Jambavan reminded <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Hanuman" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=hanuman" title="Search corpus for 'Hanuman'">Hanuman</a> of his forgotten powers. Suddenly remembering his divine strength, Hanuman grew to enormous size and leaped across the ocean in one mighty bound - a distance of 100 yojanas (about 800 miles). This leap is one of the most iconic images in Hindu iconography, symbolizing the power that comes when one acts in service of the divine. During his flight, he was tested by various beings but overcame all obstacles through wit and strength.</li>

<li><strong>Finding Sita - The Perfect Messenger:</strong> In Lanka, <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Hanuman" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=hanuman" title="Search corpus for 'Hanuman'">Hanuman</a> made himself tiny to search undetected. He found Sita in the Ashoka grove, gave her Rama's ring as proof, and offered to carry her back. But Sita refused - she wanted Rama himself to rescue her and defeat Ravana, upholding dharma. Hanuman understood this wisdom perfectly. His role was not to solve the problem himself, but to serve Rama's larger purpose. This demonstrates perfect devotion - knowing when to act and when to step back, having no ego about being the hero.</li>

<li><strong>Burning of Lanka:</strong> Before leaving, <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Hanuman" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=hanuman" title="Search corpus for 'Hanuman'">Hanuman</a> allowed himself to be captured to meet Ravana. When the demons tied his tail with oil-soaked cloth and set it on fire, he broke free, made his tail grow enormously long, and used it to set fire to the golden city of Lanka, burning it down except for Sita's location. This act demonstrated his power and delivered a warning to Ravana of the destruction to come. The burning tail became another iconic image of Hanuman's might.</li>

<li><strong>Bringing the Sanjeevani Mountain:</strong> During the great battle, when Lakshmana lay near death from an arrow, the only cure was the Sanjeevani herb from the Himalayas. <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Hanuman" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=hanuman" title="Search corpus for 'Hanuman'">Hanuman</a> flew to the mountain, but unable to identify which herb it was in the darkness, he uprooted the entire mountain and carried it to Lanka. This extraordinary feat - carrying a mountain through the air across India - shows that for true devotion, nothing is impossible. His practical solution also demonstrates wisdom: when in doubt, bring everything needed.</li>

<li><strong>Rama in the Heart:</strong> After Sita's rescue, when Sita gave <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Hanuman" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=hanuman" title="Search corpus for 'Hanuman'">Hanuman</a> a pearl necklace as thanks, he broke it apart, examining each pearl. When asked what he was doing, he said he was looking for Rama - anything without Rama's name had no value to him. Some doubted his devotion, so Hanuman tore open his chest to reveal <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Rama" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=rama" title="Search corpus for 'Rama'">Rama</a> and Sita literally inscribed on his heart. This is the ultimate image of bhakti - the beloved lord residing permanently in the devotee's heart.</li>

<li><strong>The Immortal Chiranjivi:</strong> When the time came for <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Rama" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=rama" title="Search corpus for 'Rama'">Rama</a> to leave his earthly form, Hanuman was overcome with grief. Rama blessed him to remain on earth for the entire Kali Yuga (current age), living wherever the Ramayana is sung and <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Rama" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=rama" title="Search corpus for 'Rama'">Rama</a>'s name is chanted. Thus Hanuman is considered a Chiranjivi (immortal being), and devotees believe he is invisibly present whenever his name or Rama's name is spoken with devotion.</li>

<li><strong>Meeting Krishna:</strong> In the Mahabharata, when Bhima (another son of Vayu) tried to move what appeared to be an old monkey's tail blocking his path, he couldn't budge it. The old monkey revealed himself as <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Hanuman" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=hanuman" title="Search corpus for 'Hanuman'">Hanuman</a> and blessed Bhima. Later, during the great war, Hanuman resided on Arjuna's chariot flag at <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Krishna" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=krishna" title="Search corpus for 'Krishna'">Krishna</a>'s request, his roar terrifying enemies and protecting the Pandavas. This shows Hanuman serving both major avatars of <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Vishnu" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=vishnu" title="Search corpus for 'Vishnu'">Vishnu</a> - Rama and Krishna.</li>

<p><a class="corpus-link" data-term="Hanuman" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=hanuman" title="Search corpus for 'Hanuman'">Hanuman</a> embodies ideal qualities that make him universally beloved:</p>

<div class="form-section">
<h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary);">Perfect Devotion (Bhakti)</h3>
<p>His love for <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Rama" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=rama" title="Search corpus for 'Rama'">Rama</a> is completely selfless. He wants nothing for himself, only to serve. This is bhakti yoga in its purest form - the path of devotion where the devotee's ego dissolves in love for the divine.</p>
</div>

<div class="form-section">
<h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary);">Strength in Humility</h3>
<p>Despite possessing the strength to move mountains and leap oceans, <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Hanuman" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=hanuman" title="Search corpus for 'Hanuman'">Hanuman</a> remains humble, never boastful.

<div class="form-section">
<h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary);">Celibacy and Focus</h3>
<p>As a lifelong celibate (Brahmachari), <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Hanuman" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=hanuman" title="Search corpus for 'Hanuman'">Hanuman</a> channeled all his energy into devotion and service.

</div>

<div class="form-section">
<h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary);">Intelligence and Wisdom</h3>
<p>Hanuman is not just strong but wise. He knows Sanskrit, composes poetry, and solves problems through cleverness as much as might. His wisdom lies in knowing that all his powers come from grace, not from himself.</p>

            <strong>Sun Wukong</strong>, the Monkey King from Chinese mythology, shares Hanuman's simian form, superhuman strength, ability to fly, and shape-shifting powers. However, while Sun Wukong is rebellious and ego-driven (though eventually reformed), Hanuman represents perfect devotion and humility from the beginning. Both show the archetype of the powerful monkey figure who aids divine heroes.
