<p><a class="corpus-link" data-term="Lakshmi" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=lakshmi" title="Search corpus for 'Lakshmi'">Lakshmi</a> is one of the most beloved and widely worshipped goddesses in Hinduism, revered across all traditions and sects. She represents the material and spiritual prosperity necessary for dharma (righteousness), artha (wealth), kama (pleasure), and moksha (liberation) - the four aims of human life. Her presence brings not just material success but also inner peace, grace, and the fertile conditions in which virtue can flourish. Unlike mere fortune that is fickle and fleeting, Lakshmi embodies stable prosperity earned through virtue and dharma.</p>

<h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">Key <a data-term="Myths" data-tradition="hindu" class="corpus-link" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=myths" title="View myths in ancient texts">Myths</a>:</h3>
<ul style="margin: 1rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
<li><strong>The Churning of the Cosmic Ocean (Samudra Manthan):</strong> The most famous origin story of <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Lakshmi" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=lakshmi" title="Search corpus for 'Lakshmi'">Lakshmi</a> comes from the churning of the cosmic ocean, <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Kshira Sagara" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=ocean" title="Search corpus for 'Kshira Sagara'">Kshira Sagara</a>. The devas (gods) and asuras (demons) joined forces to churn the ocean of milk using Mount Mandara as a churning rod and the serpent Vasuki as a rope, seeking the nectar of immortality (amrita). From this cosmic churning emerged fourteen precious treasures, and among them arose <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Lakshmi" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=lakshmi" title="Search corpus for 'Lakshmi'">Lakshmi</a>, seated upon a fully bloomed lotus, radiating beauty and light. She held lotuses in her hands, and two elephants bathed her with sacred water from golden vessels. The gods and sages sang hymns in her praise. <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Lakshmi" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=lakshmi" title="Search corpus for 'Lakshmi'">Lakshmi</a> chose <a class="inline-search-link" href="./vishnu.html">Vishnu</a> as her eternal consort, garlanding him and taking her place beside him. This story establishes her as the goddess who emerges from the depths of the cosmic process, bringing abundance to the world.</li>

<li><strong>Eternal Consort of Vishnu:</strong> <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Lakshmi" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=lakshmi" title="Search corpus for 'Lakshmi'">Lakshmi</a> is inseparably connected to <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Vishnu" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=vishnu" title="Search corpus for 'Vishnu'">Vishnu</a>, the preserver of the universe. While he lies upon the cosmic serpent Shesha in the ocean of milk, she massages his feet, symbolizing their eternal partnership. Whenever <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Vishnu" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=vishnu" title="Search corpus for 'Vishnu'">Vishnu</a> incarnates on earth as an avatar to restore dharma, <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Lakshmi" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=lakshmi" title="Search corpus for 'Lakshmi'">Lakshmi</a> incarnates alongside him as his companion: as Sita when he was <a class="inline-search-link" href="../heroes/rama.html">Rama</a>, as Rukmini and Radha when he was <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Krishna" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=krishna" title="Search corpus for 'Krishna'">Krishna</a>, and as Padmavati when he was Venkateswara. This eternal partnership represents the union of preservation (Vishnu) with prosperity (Lakshmi) - the cosmos cannot be sustained without both.</li>

<li><strong>The Fickleness and Stability of Fortune:</strong> Though <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Lakshmi" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=lakshmi" title="Search corpus for 'Lakshmi'">Lakshmi</a> is benevolent, Hindu philosophy recognizes that fortune is unstable - she is said to be "chanchala" (restless), never staying in one place long. Stories tell of her leaving those who become proud, greedy, or unrighteous. The demon king Bali, despite his devotion, lost her favor when he became arrogant. The Pandava brothers in the Mahabharata maintained her favor through their adherence to dharma, even in exile. This teaching emphasizes that wealth and prosperity must be earned and maintained through virtue, humility, and generosity. <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Lakshmi" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=lakshmi" title="Search corpus for 'Lakshmi'">Lakshmi</a> favors those who work hard, remain ethical, and use their prosperity for the benefit of others.</li>

<li><strong>Lakshmi and the Lotus:</strong> The lotus is <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Lakshmi" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=lakshmi" title="Search corpus for 'Lakshmi'">Lakshmi</a>'s primary symbol, representing purity and spiritual perfection rising from the mud of material existence. She is often depicted sitting or standing on a fully bloomed lotus, holding lotus buds in her hands. This symbolizes that true prosperity blooms beautifully even amidst worldly challenges, and that spiritual wealth is the highest form of abundance. The lotus also never gets wet despite growing in water, teaching that one should live in the world of wealth without becoming attached to or corrupted by it.</li>

<li><strong>Alakshmi - The Shadow Side:</strong> In some traditions, <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Lakshmi" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=lakshmi" title="Search corpus for 'Lakshmi'">Lakshmi</a> has a shadow counterpart called Alakshmi or Jyeshtha, the goddess of misfortune and poverty who dwells in quarrelsome households, dirty places, and where dharma is violated. This duality teaches that prosperity and misfortune are two faces of the same force - one must actively create conditions that attract Lakshmi (cleanliness, harmony, generosity, hard work) and repel Alakshmi (conflict, laziness, uncleanliness, greed).</li>

<li><strong>Kubera's Lesson:</strong> Kubera, the god of wealth and treasurer of the gods, once became arrogant about his riches. <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Lakshmi" data-tradition="hindu" href="../../../mythos/hindu/corpus-search.html?term=lakshmi" title="Search corpus for 'Lakshmi'">Lakshmi</a> visited him in disguise as a humble woman. Kubera failed to show her proper respect and honor. She revealed herself and left him, teaching that wealth without humility and grace is hollow. True prosperity includes inner qualities: generosity, respect, beauty of character, and compassion.</li>

    "Then, seated upon a full-blown lotus, and holding a water-lily in her hand, the goddess Sri, radiant with beauty, rose from the waves. The great sages, enraptured, hymned her with the song devoted to her praise. Visvavasu and other celestial choristers sang, and Ghritachi and other nymphs danced before her. Ganga and other holy rivers attended to offer her homage. The elephants of the skies, taking up their pure water in vases of gold, poured it over the goddess, the queen of the universe. The ocean gave her a wreath of never-fading flowers. And thus bathed, attired, and adorned, the goddess, in the view of the celestials, cast herself upon the breast of Hari."

    "Then there appeared the goddess of fortune, Lakshmi, who is absolutely beautiful. She appeared with a lotus flower in her hand, and she was being worshiped by the celestial beings with all kinds of paraphernalia. The goddess of fortune is the constant companion of Narayana, and therefore she is called Narayani. She is transcendental and beyond compare. Neither Brahma, Shiva, nor any other god can compare to her. The devas and asuras greatly desired to possess her. But Mahalakshmi, completely indifferent to them all, chose only Hari as her eternal consort, placing a garland upon his neck."

Both are depicted with symbols of abundance, both can be fickle in their favor, and both represent the understanding that prosperity must be earned through virtue and can be lost through vice.
