        <h3 style="color: var(--color-primary); margin-top: 0;">&#128220; The Celestial Report (报告天庭)</h3>
        <p>Zao Jun's most important function is serving as the Jade Emperor's eyes and ears within every household:</p>
        <ul class="styled-list">
            <li><strong>Year-Round Observation:</strong> Throughout the year, Zao Jun watches all that happens in the home - arguments, kindnesses, dishonesty, charity, family harmony, and moral conduct</li>
            <li><strong>The Journey to Heaven:</strong> On the 23rd (north) or 24th (south) day of the 12th lunar month, Zao Jun ascends to heaven to deliver his annual report to the Jade Emperor</li>
            <li><strong>The Report's Consequences:</strong> Based on his report, the Jade Emperor adjusts each family's fortune for the coming year - granting prosperity to the virtuous and misfortune to the wicked</li>
            <li><strong>The Return:</strong> Zao Jun returns to earth on New Year's Eve, ready to begin another year of observation</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top: var(--spacing-md); font-style: italic;">This annual cycle makes Zao Jun central to New Year traditions and the moral economy of the household.</p>

    <h2 style="color: var(--color-primary); margin-bottom: var(--spacing-md);">Mythology & Stories</h2>
    <div class="glass-card">
        <p>Several origin stories explain how Zao Jun became the Kitchen God, most involving themes of guilt, redemption, and domestic loyalty:</p>

        <h3 style="color: var(--color-primary); margin-top: var(--spacing-lg);">Key Myths:</h3>
        <ul class="styled-list">
            <li><strong>The Tale of Zhang Lang:</strong> The most popular origin story tells of Zhang Lang, a mortal man who abandoned his faithful wife Guo Dingxiang to marry a younger woman. His new wife was cruel and wasteful, and eventually left him. Zhang Lang became a beggar, wandering until he arrived by chance at the door of his former wife, who had remarried and prospered. She recognized him and kindly gave him food. Overcome with shame, Zhang Lang threw himself into her kitchen fire. The Jade Emperor, moved by this act of remorse, appointed him Kitchen God - condemned forever to watch over the domestic realm he had once betrayed.</li>

            <li><strong>Alternative Origin - The Loyal Servant:</strong> Another tradition holds that Zao Jun was originally a devoted servant who protected his master's household at the cost of his own life. The Jade Emperor rewarded his loyalty by making him protector of all households.</li>

            <li><strong>The Jade Emperor's Spy:</strong> Some tales describe Zao Jun as a spirit specifically created by the Jade Emperor to monitor mortal behavior. He was placed in the kitchen because it is the heart of the home, where family members gather and true natures are revealed.</li>

            <li><strong>Zao Jun and His Wife:</strong> Zao Jun is often depicted with his wife, Zao Jun Nainai (灶君奶奶), who assists in observing the household. In some traditions, she softens his reports, interceding for families who show genuine effort despite their mistakes.</li>

            <li><strong>The Sweet Bribe:</strong> A famous story explains why sweet foods are offered to Zao Jun before his journey to heaven. One family, anxious about their misbehavior throughout the year, smeared honey on Zao Jun's lips so he would only speak sweet words to the Jade Emperor - or so his lips would stick together and he could not report at all! This custom became universal.</li>
        </ul>
