<h2 style="color: var(--color-primary);">Overview</h2>
<p>The elder tree was sacred to <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Freya" data-tradition="norse" href="../corpus-search.html?tradition=norse&term=freya" title="Search corpus for 'Freya'">Freya</a>, goddess of love, beauty, and magic. This powerful tree held deep significance in Norse spiritual practice, serving as a gateway between worlds and a dwelling place for protective spirits. The elder's association with both healing and the otherworld made it a tree of profound magical power.</p>

<h2 style="color: var(--color-primary);">Mythological Significance</h2>
<h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">Freya's Sacred Tree</h3>
<p>The elder belonged to <a href="../deities/freya.html">Freya</a>, the Vanir goddess who taught the Aesir the art of <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Seidr" data-tradition="norse" href="../corpus-search.html?tradition=norse&term=seidr" title="Search corpus for 'Seidr'">seidr</a> (shamanic magic). The elder's connection to magic, fertility, and the spirit world reflected Freya's dominion over these mysteries. Practitioners of seidr often worked near elder trees or used elder wood in their magical implements.</p>
<h3 style="color: var(--color-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">Guardian Spirits</h3>
<p>Norse tradition held that each elder tree was inhabited by a protective spirit—the Elder Mother (Hyldemoer in Danish tradition). Before cutting any part of an elder, one had to ask the Elder Mother's permission and explain the purpose, or risk her curse. This belief emphasized the sacred nature of the tree and the importance of respectful relationship with nature spirits.</p>

<h2 style="color: var(--color-primary);">Practical and Cultural Significance</h2>
<p>The Norse treated elder with great reverence and caution. While its berries and flowers provided valuable medicine and food, cutting or harming an elder without proper ritual observance was considered dangerous. The wood was rarely used for fuel or building, as burning elder was thought to invite misfortune. Instead, elder served primarily magical and protective purposes, maintaining its sacred status through practical taboos.</p>
