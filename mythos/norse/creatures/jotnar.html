<h2>Jotnar - The Primordial Giants</h2>
<p style="font-size: 1.2rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
                The Jotnar (singular: Jötunn; Old Norse for "devourers") are the giants of Norse mythology,
                primordial beings who embody the raw, untamed forces of nature—ice, fire, mountains, and storms.
                Though often called "giants," they are not necessarily larger than the gods (Aesir and Vanir),
                but rather represent chaos, wilderness, and the primal powers that existed before the ordered
                cosmos. The Jotnar are ancient enemies of the gods, yet they are also their ancestors, lovers,
                and occasional allies, creating a complex and ambiguous relationship.
            </p>
</section>

<section>
<h2 style="color: var(--color-primary);">Nature and Origins</h2>

<div class="glass-card">
<h3>The First Giant - Ymir</h3>
<p>
                    In the beginning was the void <strong>Ginnungagap</strong>, the gap between Muspelheim (realm of fire)
                    and Niflheim (realm of ice). When the heat and ice met, they created the first being: <strong>Ymir</strong>,
                    the primordial frost giant. From Ymir's body, more giants were born—from his sweat came male and female
                    giants, and his legs mated with each other to produce a six-headed son.
                </p>
<p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                    Later, Odin and his brothers (Vili and Ve) slew Ymir and created the world from his corpse:
                </p>
<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 2rem;">
<li>His flesh became the earth</li>
<li>His blood became the seas and lakes</li>
<li>His bones became the mountains</li>
<li>His teeth became rocks and stones</li>
<li>His skull became the sky</li>
<li>His brains became the clouds</li>
<li>His eyebrows became Midgard (the human world)</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                    Thus, the entire world is literally the body of the first giant—creation born from primordial sacrifice.
                </p>
</div>

<div class="glass-card">
<h3>Types of Jotnar</h3>
<p>
                    The Jotnar are not a single unified race but encompass various types associated with different
                    natural forces:
                </p>

<div class="giant-grid" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
<div class="giant-card">
<h4>Frost Giants (Hrímþursar)</h4>
<p>Descend from Ymir, dwell in Jotunheim, associated with ice, winter, and cold.</p>
</div>

<div class="giant-card">
<h4>Fire Giants (Eldjötnar)</h4>
<p>Dwell in Muspelheim, led by Surtr, associated with fire, heat, and volcanic forces.</p>
</div>

<div class="giant-card">
<h4>Mountain Giants (Bergrisar)</h4>
<p>Associated with mountains, stone, and earth. Often depicted as living in rocky fortresses.</p>
</div>

<div class="giant-card">
<h4>Storm Giants</h4>
<p>Associated with thunder, winds, and tempests. Control weather and destructive natural phenomena.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="glass-card">
<h3>Jotunheim - Land of the Giants</h3>
<p>
                    <strong>Jotunheim</strong> (or Jötunheimr, "home of the giants") is one of the Nine Worlds in Norse
                    cosmology. It is a wild, untamed land of mountains, forests, and frozen wastes beyond the ordered
                    realm of the gods (Asgard) and humans (Midgard). Jotunheim represents the wilderness that surrounds
                    and threatens civilization—the chaos that borders order.
                </p>
<p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                    Despite being enemies, the realms are not completely separated. The gods occasionally visit Jotunheim
                    (often in disguise or through trickery), and some giants dwell closer to the gods' realm. The boundary
                    is permeable, reflecting the complex relationship between order and chaos.
                </p>

<section style="margin-top: var(--space-8);">
<h2 style="color: var(--color-primary);">Notable Jotnar</h2>

<div class="glass-card">
<h3>Ymir</h3>
<p>
                    The primordial frost giant from whom all other giants descend. His body became the cosmos itself
                    when Odin and his brothers killed him. Represents the undifferentiated chaos before creation.
                </p>
</div>

<div class="glass-card">
<h3>Surtr</h3>
<p>
                    The fire giant who rules Muspelheim. At Ragnarok (the end of the world), Surtr will lead the
                    fire giants against the gods and set the world ablaze with his flaming sword. He represents
                    the ultimate destructive force that will consume all creation.
                </p>
</div>

<div class="glass-card">
<h3>Skadi</h3>
<p>
                    Goddess of winter, skiing, and hunting, Skadi is a giantess who married into the Aesir (becoming
                    wife of Njord) after her father was killed by the gods. She represents the integration of giant
                    and god, wilderness and civilization. Skadi chose Njord by his feet alone, thinking she was choosing
                    Baldr, and their marriage was famously incompatible—he loved the sea, she the mountains.
                </p>
</div>

<div class="glass-card">
<h3>Thrym</h3>
<p>
                    The giant who stole Thor's hammer Mjolnir and demanded the goddess Freyja as ransom. Thor disguised
                    himself as Freyja (a source of much comedic tension in the myth) to recover his hammer and then
                    slaughtered Thrym and all his kin at the "wedding feast."
                </p>
</div>

<div class="glass-card">
<h3>Utgard-Loki</h3>
<p>
                    A cunning giant king who tricked Thor through illusions. Thor thought he was competing in tests of
                    strength but was actually struggling against concepts: he wrestled with Old Age (which defeats all),
                    tried to drain a horn connected to the ocean, and attempted to lift the Midgard Serpent. Utgard-Loki
                    represents the limits of even divine power before the fundamental forces of nature.
                </p>
</div>

<div class="glass-card">
<h3>Hrungnir</h3>
<p>
                    The strongest of all giants, with a heart of stone and a head of stone. Thor killed him in single
                    combat, but a piece of Hrungnir's whetstone lodged in Thor's head, remaining there forever—a reminder
                    that even victories against chaos come at a cost.
                </p>
</div>

<div class="glass-card">
<h3>Gerd</h3>
<p>
                    A beautiful giantess, daughter of the giant Gymir. The god Freyr fell desperately in love with her
                    and gave up his magical sword to win her hand—a sacrifice that will prove fatal at Ragnarok when he
                    faces Surtr unarmed. Represents the dangerous allure of the wild and the price of desire.
                </p>
</div>
</section>

<section style="margin-top: var(--space-8);">
<h2 style="color: var(--color-primary);">Relationship with the Gods</h2>

<div class="glass-card">
<h3>Enemies and Allies</h3>
<p>
                    The relationship between gods and giants is deeply ambiguous:
                </p>
<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
<li><strong>Cosmic Enemies:</strong> At Ragnarok, the giants will assault Asgard and battle the gods in the final conflict</li>
<li><strong>Intermarriage:</strong> Many gods have giant ancestry (Odin's mother was a giantess; Thor's mother Jord is often identified as a giantess)</li>
<li><strong>Lovers:</strong> Gods and giants frequently intermarry or have affairs (Freyr and Gerd, Njord and Skadi, Odin and various giantesses)</li>
<li><strong>Sources of Wisdom:</strong> Giants often possess ancient knowledge that the gods seek (Mimir, Vafthrudnir)</li>
<li><strong>Threats to Order:</strong> Giants constantly threaten to breach the boundaries of civilization and return the world to chaos</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                    This paradox reflects a deep truth: civilization (the gods) emerges from and depends upon nature
                    (the giants), yet must constantly struggle against being overwhelmed by it. The giants are not
                    purely evil but represent necessary cosmic forces—chaotic, yes, but also primordial and essential.
                </p>
</div>

<div class="glass-card">
<h3>Thor's Role as Giant-Slayer</h3>
<p>
                    <strong>Thor</strong>, god of thunder, is the primary defender of the gods against the giants.
                    Much of Norse mythology consists of Thor journeying to Jotunheim to kill giants who threaten
                    the cosmic order. His hammer Mjolnir is primarily a weapon against the giants. Yet ironically,
                    Thor himself is half-giant (through his mother), and at Ragnarok he will kill and be killed by
                    the Midgard Serpent, a child of Loki (who is himself a giant).
                </p>
</div>
</section>

<section style="margin-top: var(--space-8);">
<h2 style="color: var(--color-primary);">Ragnarok and the Final Battle</h2>

<div class="glass-card">
<h3>The Giants' Revenge</h3>
<p>
                    At <strong>Ragnarok</strong> (the twilight of the gods), the giants will have their ultimate vengeance:
                </p>
<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
<li>Surtr will lead the fire giants from Muspelheim, setting the world aflame</li>
<li>The frost giants will sail in the ship Naglfar (made of dead men's nails)</li>
<li>Loki will break free and lead the giants against the gods</li>
<li>Heimdall will blow the Gjallarhorn, warning of the giants' approach</li>
<li>The giants will storm across the Bifrost bridge into Asgard</li>
<li>In the final battle, both gods and giants will be destroyed</li>
<li>Surtr's flames will consume the Nine Worlds</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                    This apocalypse represents the ultimate victory of chaos over order—but it is not the final end.
                    The world will be reborn from the ashes, green and fertile, and a new generation of gods will rule.
                    The cycle of creation from destruction continues.
