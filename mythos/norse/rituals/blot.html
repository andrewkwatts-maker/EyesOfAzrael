<h2>Sacred Blood Sacrifice of the North</h2>
<p>
The <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Blót" data-tradition="norse" href="../corpus-search.html?tradition=norse&term=blot" title="Search corpus for 'Blót'">blót</a>
(Old Norse "blessing" or "sacrifice") was the central ritual of Norse religion, a communal sacrifice feast honoring the gods and spirits.
Through offerings of animals, mead, and food, Norse peoples maintained reciprocal relationships with <a href="../deities/odin.html">Odin</a>,
<a href="../deities/thor.html">Thor</a>, <a href="../deities/freyr.html">Freyr</a>, and the land spirits (landvættir), ensuring fertility,
prosperity, victory in battle, and cosmic order. The ritual combined sacrifice, feasting, and sacred drinking in ceremonies that bound
communities to their gods and to each other.
