<h2>Avraham Avinu - Our Father Abraham</h2>
<p>
<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Abraham" data-tradition="jewish" href="../../../corpus-results/jewish/abraham.html" title="Search corpus for 'Abraham'">Abraham</a> (Hebrew: Avraham) is the founding patriarch of the Jewish people, the first Hebrew, and the father of
monotheism. Born Abram in Ur of the Chaldees, he received God's call to leave his homeland and journey to Canaan, where
God established an eternal covenant with him and his descendants. He is revered as "Avraham Avinu" (Abraham our Father),
the first to recognize the One True God and the ancestor of the Israelite nation.
</p>

<h2>The Call and Covenant</h2>
<p>
God called Abram to "Go forth from your land, your birthplace, and your father's house, to the land that I will show you."
God promised to make him a great nation, bless him, make his name great, and make him a blessing to all families of the
earth. Abram obeyed this radical call, leaving everything familiar for an unknown destination. This act of faith became
the defining characteristic of <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Abraham" data-tradition="jewish" href="../../../corpus-results/jewish/abraham.html" title="Search corpus for 'Abraham'">Abraham</a>—absolute trust in God's promises despite impossible circumstances.
</p>

<h2>The Covenant Between the Parts</h2>
<p>
God formalized His covenant with Abram in a dramatic ceremony involving sacrificed animals split in half (the Covenant
Between the Parts). God promised Abram's descendants would be as numerous as the stars, would inherit the land from Egypt
to the Euphrates, and would become a blessing to all nations. This covenant established the eternal relationship between
God and the Jewish people.
</p>

<h2>Circumcision and Name Change</h2>
<p>
When Abram was 99 years old, God appeared to him again, changing his name to <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Abraham" data-tradition="jewish" href="../../../corpus-results/jewish/abraham.html" title="Search corpus for 'Abraham'">Abraham</a> ("father of many nations") and
his wife Sarai's name to Sarah ("princess"). God established circumcision as the eternal sign of the covenant, to be
performed on all males on the eighth day after birth. This physical mark would distinguish Abraham's descendants as God's
covenant people forever.
</p>

<h2>The Birth of Isaac</h2>
<p>
Despite being elderly and barren, Sarah miraculously conceived and bore <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Isaac" data-tradition="jewish" href="../../../corpus-results/jewish/isaac.html" title="Search corpus for 'Isaac'">Isaac</a> (Yitzchak, "he will laugh") when
<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Abraham" data-tradition="jewish" href="../../../corpus-results/jewish/abraham.html" title="Search corpus for 'Abraham'">Abraham</a> was 100 and Sarah 90. This miraculous birth of the covenant child demonstrated God's power to fulfill His
promises regardless of natural impossibility. <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Isaac" data-tradition="jewish" href="../../../corpus-results/jewish/isaac.html" title="Search corpus for 'Isaac'">Isaac</a> would carry the covenant to the next generation, ensuring the
continuity of God's promises.
</p>

<h2>The Binding of Isaac (Akedah)</h2>
<p>
The supreme test of Abraham's faith came when God commanded him to offer <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Isaac" data-tradition="jewish" href="../../../corpus-results/jewish/isaac.html" title="Search corpus for 'Isaac'">Isaac</a> as a burnt offering on Mount Moriah. This
command contradicted everything—God's promises, moral law, and Abraham's love for his son. Yet <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Abraham" data-tradition="jewish" href="../../../corpus-results/jewish/abraham.html" title="Search corpus for 'Abraham'">Abraham</a> rose early,
prepared wood, and took <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Isaac" data-tradition="jewish" href="../../../corpus-results/jewish/isaac.html" title="Search corpus for 'Isaac'">Isaac</a> to the place God indicated. When <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Isaac" data-tradition="jewish" href="../../../corpus-results/jewish/isaac.html" title="Search corpus for 'Isaac'">Isaac</a> asked "Where is the lamb for the offering?"
<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Abraham" data-tradition="jewish" href="../../../corpus-results/jewish/abraham.html" title="Search corpus for 'Abraham'">Abraham</a> replied prophetically, "God will provide the lamb, my son."
</p>

<p>
At the moment <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Abraham" data-tradition="jewish" href="../../../corpus-results/jewish/abraham.html" title="Search corpus for 'Abraham'">Abraham</a> raised the knife, an angel stopped him: "Do not lay your hand on the boy... for now I know that you
fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me." A ram caught in a thicket was sacrificed instead.
This Akedah (Binding) became the paradigm of Jewish faith—complete submission to God even when His commands seem impossible
to understand. The site, Mount Moriah, would later become the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.
</p>

<h2>Other Significant Events</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hospitality to Angels:</strong> <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Abraham" data-tradition="jewish" href="../../../corpus-results/jewish/abraham.html" title="Search corpus for 'Abraham'">Abraham</a> welcomed three visitors (angels in disguise) with lavish hospitality,
establishing the Jewish value of hachnasat orchim (welcoming guests)</li>
<li><strong>Intercession for Sodom:</strong> <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Abraham" data-tradition="jewish" href="../../../corpus-results/jewish/abraham.html" title="Search corpus for 'Abraham'">Abraham</a> boldly negotiated with God to spare Sodom if even ten righteous people
could be found, demonstrating the power and boldness of prayer</li>
<li><strong>Burial of Sarah:</strong> <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Abraham" data-tradition="jewish" href="../../../corpus-results/jewish/abraham.html" title="Search corpus for 'Abraham'">Abraham</a> purchased the Cave of Machpelah as Sarah's burial place, the first land owned
in Canaan and the eventual burial site for the patriarchs and matriarchs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legacy and Significance</h2>
<p>
<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Abraham" data-tradition="jewish" href="../../../corpus-results/jewish/abraham.html" title="Search corpus for 'Abraham'">Abraham</a> is the father of the Jewish nation and, through conversion, the spiritual father of all Jews. His discovery of
monotheism (tradition says he recognized God through reason and observation of nature), his unwavering faith despite
impossible circumstances, and his willingness to sacrifice everything for God established the pattern of Jewish existence.
</p>

<p>
The covenant with <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Abraham" data-tradition="jewish" href="../../../corpus-results/jewish/abraham.html" title="Search corpus for 'Abraham'">Abraham</a> forms the foundation of Jewish identity: Jews are the children of <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Abraham" data-tradition="jewish" href="../../../corpus-results/jewish/abraham.html" title="Search corpus for 'Abraham'">Abraham</a>, Isaac, and
Jacob, inheritors of God's promises, and bearers of a mission to be a "light to the nations." Every prayer service invokes
the "God of Abraham, <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Isaac" data-tradition="jewish" href="../../../corpus-results/jewish/isaac.html" title="Search corpus for 'Isaac'">Isaac</a>, and Jacob." His merit (zechut avot) is pleaded before God on behalf of his descendants.
The Jewish people see themselves as continuing Abraham's journey of faith, called to leave the familiar and trust God's
promises.
</p>

<h2>The Merit of Abraham</h2>
<p>
Jewish tradition teaches that Abraham's righteousness creates merit (zechut) for his descendants. His ten tests of faith
(including the Akedah as the supreme test), his kindness, his battles to rescue his nephew Lot, and his teaching of
monotheism to thousands earn eternal credit that protects and sustains the Jewish people. In times of persecution and
exile, Jews appeal to the "merit of the fathers" (zechut avot), trusting that God will remember His covenant with <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Abraham" data-tradition="jewish" href="../../../corpus-results/jewish/abraham.html" title="Search corpus for 'Abraham'">Abraham</a>.
