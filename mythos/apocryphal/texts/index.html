                <p><strong>Date:</strong> 3rd-1st century BCE | <strong>Language:</strong> Aramaic/Hebrew (original), Ge'ez (complete version)</p>
                <p>
                    The most important Enochian text, 1 Enoch is actually a compilation of five separate books
                    that tell the story of Enoch's heavenly journeys and revelations. It is the primary source for
                    the Watchers mythology and provides detailed angelology, cosmology, and apocalyptic visions.
                    Though excluded from most Biblical canons, it was considered scripture by the Ethiopian Orthodox
                    Church and is quoted in the New Testament book of Jude.
                </p>

                <h4 style="color: var(--color-primary); margin-top: 1rem;">The Five Books:</h4>

                    <li><strong>Book of Dream Visions (Chapters 83-90):</strong> Two apocalyptic visions shown to
                    Enoch. The first predicts the Flood. The second (Animal Apocalypse) retells biblical history

                    who stands at God's right hand. This text is a key source for Merkabah mysticism and describes
                    the celestial palace (Hekhalot) and the angelic hierarchies in detail. It portrays Rabbi Ishmael's
                    mystical ascent to heaven where Metatron reveals cosmic secrets.

                <h3>Enochian Literature at Qumran</h3>
                <p>
                    The Dead Sea Scrolls, discovered in caves near Qumran (1947-1956), contained numerous fragments
                    of Enochian literature, proving these texts were valued by the Essene community. The finds include:
                </p>
                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li><strong>Multiple copies of 1 Enoch:</strong> Aramaic fragments covering most sections except
                    the Parables. At least 11 different manuscripts found.</li>
                    <li><strong>Book of Giants fragments:</strong> Elaborates on the Nephilim giants and their fate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Book of Jubilees:</strong> Numerous copies showing its importance to the community.</li>
                    <li><strong>Genesis Apocryphon:</strong> Retelling of Genesis with expanded stories about Noah
                    and Abraham, showing Enochian influence.</li>

                    The presence of these texts at Qumran demonstrates that Enochian traditions were part of
                    mainstream Jewish thought in the Second Temple period, not fringe beliefs. The community used
                    the solar calendar described in 1 Enoch rather than the lunar calendar of the Jerusalem Temple.

                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li><strong>Early Christianity:</strong> The Epistle of Jude quotes 1 Enoch as scripture. Early
                    Church Fathers like Tertullian accepted Enochian literature as authentic. Later declared
                    non-canonical but continued to influence Christian angelology.</li>

                    <li><strong>Jewish Mysticism:</strong> Foundation for Kabbalah and Merkabah mysticism. The
                    concept of Metatron became central to Jewish esoteric thought. Enochian cosmology shaped
                    understanding of heavenly realms.</li>

                    <li><strong>Islam:</strong> Islamic tradition includes stories of Idris (identified with Enoch)
                    who ascended to heaven. Some Islamic texts show knowledge of Watchers/Nephilim traditions.</li>

                    <li><strong>Ethiopian Christianity:</strong> Only major tradition to maintain 1 Enoch in its
                    Biblical canon. Ge'ez version is the most complete text we possess.</li>

                    <li><strong>Western Esotericism:</strong> Renaissance magicians like John Dee claimed to receive
                    Enochian angelic language. Influenced Freemasonry, Theosophy, and modern occultism.</li>
