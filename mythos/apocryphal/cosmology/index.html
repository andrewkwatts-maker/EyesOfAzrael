                <p>
                    Enoch's journey through the seven heavens reveals a cosmos of ascending spiritual realms, each
                    more glorious and terrible than the last. Guided by angels, he witnesses the machinery of creation:
                    storehouses of natural phenomena, prisons for fallen angels, armies of the faithful, and ultimately
                    the throne of God himself. Each heaven has its own inhabitants, purposes, and mysteries.

                <p>
                    The Merkabah is God's divine throne-chariot, a living mechanism of cosmic power described in
                    Ezekiel's visions and elaborated in Enochian texts. Composed of four living creatures (cherubim),
                    wheels within wheels covered with eyes (ophanim), and burning coals of fire, it represents God's
                    mobile sovereignty over all creation.

                        omniscience and omnipresence. They move in any direction instantly without turning, following

                        like the tumult of an army camp.

                    - appearing like sapphire (or lapis lazuli). Upon the throne sits the figure with the appearance
                    of a human form, glowing like gleaming amber or fire, surrounded by radiance like a rainbow.

                    Enochian texts provide precise measurements of the cosmic structure, though interpreting these
                    dimensions challenges human comprehension. The numbers often carry symbolic meaning - seven
                    heavens, four living creatures, twelve gates, seventy nations, 365,000 eyes of Metatron.

                    <li><strong>Seven Heavens:</strong> Each heaven is separated by a journey of 500 years for mortals,
                    though angels traverse them instantly</li>
                    <li><strong>Divine Throne:</strong> Height equal to 600,000,000 parasangs (a parasang = roughly
                    3.5 miles), representing infinite majesty</li>

                    <h3>The Sun's Journey</h3>
                    <p>
                        Enoch describes the sun's path through twelve gates corresponding to the months. Angels harness
                        and guide its chariot. In summer it rises through the northern gates, in winter through the
                        southern. Its heat and light are carefully measured to provide exactly what the earth needs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The sun passes through these gates escorted by angels, and its intensity changes based on the
                        season and God's will. Uriel is the principal angel governing solar movements.

                    <h3>The Moon and Stars</h3>
                    <p>
                        The moon waxes and wanes according to divine law, its phases governed by Gabriel. The stars
                        have names known to God and the angels - Enoch was taught the name and function of each.
                        They march in ordered ranks like a celestial army.

                    <p>
                        Some stars are bound in chains for leaving their appointed courses - these are the "wandering
                        stars" (planets?) that transgressed divine law. They await judgment in the place of fiery
                        punishment.
