<p>
            The Book of <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Daniel" data-tradition="jewish" href="../../../../../mythos/jewish/corpus-search.html?term=daniel">Daniel</a> is the single most influential Old Testament source for the Book of Revelation.
            Both are apocalyptic visions revealing God's sovereignty over history, the rise and fall of empires,
            and the ultimate triumph of God's kingdom. <a class="corpus-link" data-term="John" data-tradition="christian" href="../../../../../mythos/christian/corpus-search.html?term=john">John</a> explicitly draws on <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Daniel" data-tradition="jewish" href="../../../../../mythos/jewish/corpus-search.html?term=daniel">Daniel</a>'s imagery of beasts,
            thrones, the Son of Man, and prophetic time periods to show how Jesus fulfills <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Daniel" data-tradition="jewish" href="../../../../../mythos/jewish/corpus-search.html?term=daniel">Daniel</a>'s visions.

                <strong>Michael the archangel</strong> appears in both texts as the defender of God's people during a time
                of unprecedented distress. In <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Daniel" data-tradition="jewish" href="../../../../../mythos/jewish/corpus-search.html?term=daniel">Daniel</a>, he arises to protect Israel; in Revelation, he casts Satan
                down from heaven. This cosmic battle results in the persecution of God's people on earth, but ultimate
                victory belongs to Michael and the saints.
