<h2>Introduction: Fire as Judgment and Purification</h2>
<p>
            Throughout Scripture, <strong>fire</strong> serves as the primary symbol of divine judgment, purification, and the consuming
            presence of God. From the burning bush to the lake of fire, God's holiness is repeatedly depicted as refining flame.
            The progression from Daniel 3's furnace to Revelation's final judgment reveals a consistent pattern: those who refuse to
            worship false gods are protected in the fire, while those who bow to idols face ultimate consuming flame.

<h4>The 6-6-6 Connection</h4>
<p>
            Nebuchadnezzar's image is <strong>60 cubits high by 6 cubits wide</strong>—a deliberate pattern of sixes that
            prefigures the beast's number <strong>666</strong>. Both represent human pretension to divine glory (six is the
            number of man, created on day six, falling short of seven = perfection). The dimensions themselves prophetically
            point to the ultimate false worship system.

<h4>Worship on Pain of Death</h4>
<p>
            Both systems enforce universal worship of an image under threat of execution. Daniel 3 = immediate death by furnace;
            Revelation 13 = death for refusing the mark. The pattern is identical: global empire, enforced idolatry, martyrdom
            for the faithful.

<h4>Theological Connection: Heat Intensified Sevenfold</h4>
<p><strong>The Pattern:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Daniel:</strong> Furnace heated 7× hotter in rage against those who refuse to worship the image</li>
<li><strong>Revelation:</strong> Sun (cosmic furnace) scorches with intense heat those who took the mark and worshiped the beast</li>
<li><strong>Both:</strong> Fire is the divine response to idolatry—purifying for the faithful, consuming for the rebellious</li>
<li><strong>Difference:</strong> Daniel's three are protected IN the fire; Revelation's marked are burned BY the fire</li>
</ul>

            <p>
                The <strong>sevenfold intensification</strong> in both passages indicates complete, perfect judgment. When fire is heated
                seven times hotter, it represents the fullness of God's wrath. Yet this same fire becomes a furnace of protection for
                those who remain faithful.

<h2>Theological Summary: Fire's Dual Purpose</h2>
<div class="glass-card">
<h3>Fire Purifies the Faithful</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Daniel 3:</strong> Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego emerge from furnace without even the smell of smoke—completely purified</li>
<li><strong>Malachi 3:</strong> Refiner's fire purifies like silver and gold</li>
<li><strong>1 Peter 1:7:</strong> "These [trials] have come so that the proven genuineness of your faith—of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire—may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed."</li>
<li><strong>Revelation 3:18:</strong> Christ offers gold refined in fire to the Laodicean church</li>
</ul>

            <h3>Fire Consumes the Rebellious</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Daniel 3:22:</strong> The soldiers who threw the three into the furnace were consumed by the flames</li>
<li><strong>Revelation 16:8-9:</strong> Those with the mark of the beast are scorched by the sun but refuse to repent</li>
<li><strong>Revelation 19:20:</strong> Beast and false prophet thrown alive into the lake of fire</li>
<li><strong>Revelation 20:10, 14-15:</strong> Devil, death, Hades, and the unfaithful cast into the lake of fire</li>
</ul>

            <h3>The Sevenfold Pattern Complete</h3>
<p>
                From Daniel's furnace heated <strong>7 times hotter</strong> to Revelation's <strong>seven bowl judgments</strong>
                (fourth bowl = scorching sun), the pattern is complete. Seven = divine perfection. When fire is intensified sevenfold,
                it represents:
            </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Complete judgment</strong> on those who worship false images (60×6 idol → 666 beast)</li>
<li><strong>Complete purification</strong> for those who refuse to bow (three Hebrews → 144,000 sealed)</li>
<li><strong>Complete protection</strong> in the midst of fire (fourth figure → Lamb in their midst)</li>
<li><strong>Complete vindication</strong> after the fire (promoted → reign with Christ)</li>
<li><strong>Complete confession</strong> of God's sovereignty (Nebuchadnezzar → all nations worship)</li>
</ol>

            <h3>From Furnace to New Creation</h3>
<p>
                The journey from Daniel 3 to Revelation 21-22 traces God's complete work:<br/>
                <strong>Daniel 3:</strong> Localized furnace test in Babylon<br/>
                <strong>Revelation 16:</strong> Cosmic furnace test (sun scorches whole earth)<br/>
                <strong>Revelation 20:</strong> Final furnace (lake of fire destroys death itself)<br/>
                <strong>Revelation 21-22:</strong> New creation where fire has done its complete work—no more curse, no more judgment,
                only the glory of God lighting the city forever
            </p>
