<h2>Revelation 4-5: God's Throne and the Lamb's Triumph</h2>
<p>After the letters to the seven churches, John is caught up "in the Spirit" to witness the heavenly throne room—the control center of the universe. This vision establishes that despite earthly chaos, <strong>God is sovereign</strong>, seated on His throne, worshiped by all creation. The scroll of destiny is opened by the Lamb who was slain.</p>
</div>

<h2>Chapter 4: The One on the Throne</h2>
<div class="scripture-box">
<p><strong>Revelation 4:2-3</strong> — "At once I was in the Spirit, and there before me was a throne in heaven with someone sitting on it. And the one who sat there had the appearance of jasper and ruby. A rainbow that shone like an emerald encircled the throne."</p>
</div>

<div class="glass-card">
<h3>Elements of the Throne Room</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Throne:</strong> Central to all—God's seat of authority over creation</li>
<li><strong>The One Seated:</strong> Described by gemstones (jasper, ruby)—radiant, glorious, beyond human form</li>
<li><strong>Rainbow:</strong> Emerald green—recalls God's covenant with Noah (Gen 9:13), a sign of mercy even in judgment</li>
<li><strong>24 Elders:</strong> Clothed in white, wearing golden crowns, seated on 24 thrones—likely representing the 12 tribes + 12 apostles, the fullness of God's people</li>
<li><strong>Lightning, Rumblings, Thunder:</strong> Echoes Mount Sinai theophany (Exodus 19:16)</li>
<li><strong>Seven Lamps:</strong> The seven spirits of God (Rev 1:4; cf. Zechariah 4:2)</li>
<li><strong>Sea of Glass:</strong> Crystal-clear, reflecting God's purity and transcendence</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>The Four Living Creatures</h2>
<div class="scripture-box">
<p><strong>Revelation 4:6-8</strong> — "In the center, around the throne, were four living creatures, and they were covered with eyes, in front and in back. The first living creature was like a lion, the second was like an ox, the third had a face like a man, the fourth was like a flying eagle. Each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around, even under its wings. Day and night they never stop saying: 'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come.'"</p>
</div>

<div class="glass-card">
<h3>The Cherubim</h3>
<p>These are <strong>cherubim</strong>—angelic beings who guard God's holiness and lead in worship. They combine imagery from <strong>Ezekiel 1</strong> (four-faced creatures) and <strong>Isaiah 6</strong> (six-winged seraphim crying "Holy, holy, holy").</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lion:</strong> Wild animals, strength, kingship</li>
<li><strong>Ox:</strong> Domestic animals, service, sacrifice</li>
<li><strong>Man:</strong> Humanity, intelligence, dominion</li>
<li><strong>Eagle:</strong> Birds of the air, swiftness, transcendence</li>
</ul>
<p>Together they represent <strong>all creation</strong> worshiping God. Covered with eyes = omniscience, all-seeing awareness.</p>
</div>

<div class="worship-section">
<h3 style="color:var(--color-primary);">The Song of Creation</h3>
<p style="font-size:1.3rem;font-weight:600;margin:1rem 0;">"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come."</p>
<p style="margin-top:1rem;">The four living creatures lead unceasing worship. The 24 elders fall down, cast their crowns before the throne, and sing:</p>
<p style="font-size:1.2rem;font-style:italic;margin:1.5rem 0;">"You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they were created and have their being." (Rev 4:11)</p>
</div>

<h2>Chapter 5: The Lamb Who Was Slain</h2>
<div class="scripture-box">
<p><strong>Revelation 5:1-5</strong> — "Then I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne a scroll with writing on both sides and sealed with seven seals. And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice, 'Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll?' But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth could open the scroll or even look inside it. I wept and wept because no one was found who was worthy... Then one of the elders said to me, 'Do not weep! See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed. He is able to open the scroll and its seven seals.'"</p>
</div>

<div class="glass-card">
<h3>The Sealed Scroll</h3>
<p>The scroll contains <strong>God's plan for history and judgment</strong>. It is sealed with seven seals, and <strong>no one is worthy to open it</strong>—neither angel, human, nor any created being. John weeps because history seems stuck, God's purposes thwarted.</p>
<p><strong>But then...</strong> the Lion of Judah, the Root of David—the promised Messiah—<strong>has triumphed</strong> and is worthy!</p>
</div>

<div class="scripture-box">
<p><strong>Revelation 5:6-7</strong> — "Then I saw a Lamb, looking as if it had been slain, standing at the center of the throne, encircled by the four living creatures and the elders. The Lamb had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth. He went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who sat on the throne."</p>
</div>

<div class="glass-card">
<h3>The Paradox: Lion and Lamb</h3>
<p>John is told to look for a <strong>Lion</strong> (symbol of power and kingship), but he sees a <strong>Lamb</strong> (symbol of sacrifice). The Lamb bears the marks of slaughter—He was killed. Yet He stands alive at the center of the throne.</p>
<p><strong>Seven horns:</strong> Complete power (horn = strength in biblical imagery)<br/>
<strong>Seven eyes:</strong> Complete knowledge (the seven spirits of God = omniscience)</p>
<p>The Lamb <strong>takes the scroll</strong>—the act of receiving authority over history and judgment. This is the fulfillment of Daniel 7:13-14 (Son of Man receiving dominion from the Ancient of Days).</p>
</div>

<div class="worship-section">
<h3 style="color:var(--color-primary);">The Song of Redemption</h3>
<p style="margin:1rem 0;">When the Lamb takes the scroll, heaven erupts in worship:</p>
<p style="font-size:1.2rem;font-style:italic;margin:1.5rem 0;">"You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals, because you were slain, and with your blood you purchased for God persons from every tribe and language and people and nation. You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God, and they will reign on the earth." (Rev 5:9-10)</p>
<p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">Then <strong>every creature</strong> in heaven, on earth, under the earth, and in the sea joins the chorus:</p>
<p style="font-size:1.2rem;font-style:italic;margin:1rem 0;">"To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be praise and honor and glory and power, for ever and ever!" (Rev 5:13)</p>
</div>

<h2>Theological Significance</h2>
<div class="glass-card">
<ul>
<li><strong>God is Sovereign:</strong> The throne is central. Despite earthly chaos, God reigns.</li>
<li><strong>Christ Conquers Through Sacrifice:</strong> The Lion is a Lamb. Victory comes through the cross.</li>
<li><strong>Worship is Central:</strong> Heaven's primary activity is worship. All creation bows before God and the Lamb.</li>
<li><strong>Universal Redemption:</strong> The Lamb purchased people from "every tribe and language and people and nation"—salvation is global.</li>
<li><strong>Christ Opens History:</strong> Only Jesus is worthy to open the seals and unfold God's plan. He holds the keys to history.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>OT Background</h2>
