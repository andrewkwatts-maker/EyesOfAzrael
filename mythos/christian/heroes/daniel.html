<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Daniel" data-tradition="christian" href="../../../corpus-results/christian/daniel.html" title="Search corpus for 'Daniel'">Daniel</a> was a Hebrew prophet and royal advisor during the Babylonian Exile, renowned for his unwavering faith, wisdom, and
prophetic visions. Taken captive to Babylon as a youth, he rose to prominence through his God-given ability to interpret
dreams and visions. His faithfulness in the face of persecution—most famously in the lions' den—and his apocalyptic visions
of future kingdoms make him one of the most significant prophets in Judeo-Christian tradition.
</p>

<h2>Early Life and Captivity</h2>
<p>
<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Daniel" data-tradition="christian" href="../../../corpus-results/christian/daniel.html" title="Search corpus for 'Daniel'">Daniel</a> was born into a noble or royal family in Judah around 620 BCE. In 605 BCE, when Nebuchadnezzar II conquered
Jerusalem, <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Daniel" data-tradition="christian" href="../../../corpus-results/christian/daniel.html" title="Search corpus for 'Daniel'">Daniel</a> was among the young nobles taken to Babylon. Despite being uprooted from his homeland and forced into
service to pagan kings, <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Daniel" data-tradition="christian" href="../../../corpus-results/christian/daniel.html" title="Search corpus for 'Daniel'">Daniel</a> maintained his faith in God throughout his long life spanning multiple empires.
</p>

<h2>Major Deeds and Miracles</h2>
<h3>Nebuchadnezzar's Dream</h3>
<p>
When King Nebuchadnezzar had troubling dreams, he demanded his wise men not only interpret the dream but tell him what he
had dreamed—an impossible task. When they failed, he ordered all wise men executed. <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Daniel" data-tradition="christian" href="../../../corpus-results/christian/daniel.html" title="Search corpus for 'Daniel'">Daniel</a> asked for time, prayed with
his companions, and God revealed both the dream and its interpretation. The dream of a great statue of different metals
represented successive world empires, with God's eternal kingdom ultimately crushing them all.
</p>

<h3>The Fiery Furnace</h3>
<p>
When <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Daniel" data-tradition="christian" href="../../../corpus-results/christian/daniel.html" title="Search corpus for 'Daniel'">Daniel</a>'s companions Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refused to worship Nebuchadnezzar's golden idol, they were thrown
into a blazing furnace heated seven times hotter than normal. Yet they walked unharmed in the flames, accompanied by a
fourth figure "like a son of the gods"—interpreted as a pre-incarnation appearance of Christ or an angel. This miracle led
Nebuchadnezzar to acknowledge the power of the God of <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Israel" data-tradition="jewish" href="../../../corpus-results/jewish/israel.html" title="Search corpus for 'Israel'">Israel</a>.
</p>

<h3>The Lions' Den</h3>
<p>
During the reign of Darius the Mede, <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Daniel" data-tradition="christian" href="../../../corpus-results/christian/daniel.html" title="Search corpus for 'Daniel'">Daniel</a> served with such distinction that jealous rivals conspired against him. They
convinced Darius to decree that for thirty days, no one could pray to any god or man except the king. <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Daniel" data-tradition="christian" href="../../../corpus-results/christian/daniel.html" title="Search corpus for 'Daniel'">Daniel</a>, who prayed
three times daily at his window facing Jerusalem, refused to stop. Cast into the lions' den, he was miraculously protected
through the night. When Darius found him unharmed, the king threw Daniel's accusers into the den instead, where they were
immediately devoured.
</p>

<h2>Prophetic Visions</h2>
<p>
<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Daniel" data-tradition="christian" href="../../../corpus-results/christian/daniel.html" title="Search corpus for 'Daniel'">Daniel</a> received extraordinary apocalyptic visions revealing the course of future history and the end times. His visions
included the four beasts representing empires, the seventy weeks prophecy concerning the coming Messiah, and visions of the
Ancient of Days and the Son of Man. These prophecies profoundly influenced Christian eschatology and understanding of
Christ's identity and second coming.
</p>

<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>
<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Daniel" data-tradition="christian" href="../../../corpus-results/christian/daniel.html" title="Search corpus for 'Daniel'">Daniel</a> exemplifies faithfulness in exile, wisdom in the midst of pagan power, and hope in God's ultimate victory. His
life demonstrates that believers can maintain integrity while serving in secular systems, and that God protects and exalts
those who remain faithful. The Book of <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Daniel" data-tradition="christian" href="../../../corpus-results/christian/daniel.html" title="Search corpus for 'Daniel'">Daniel</a> has been a source of hope for persecuted Christians throughout history.
