<h2>Biography</h2>
<p style="line-height: 1.8;">
            Andrew holds the distinction of being the first disciple called by Jesus, hence his title "Protokletos" (First-Called) in Eastern Christianity. A fisherman who initially followed John the Baptist, Andrew heard John proclaim Jesus as "the Lamb of God" and immediately sought out the Messiah. His characteristic trait throughout the Gospels is bringing people to Jesus—first his brother Peter, then the boy with loaves and fishes, and finally the Greeks seeking Jesus before His passion. This evangelistic spirit continued throughout his ministry, as tradition says he preached the Gospel across vast territories from the Black Sea to Greece.
        </p>

<h2>Key Moments in Scripture</h2>

<div class="key-moment">
<h4>1. The First to Follow Jesus</h4>
<p style="line-height: 1.8;">
                Andrew was one of two disciples of John the Baptist who heard John declare, "Behold, the Lamb of God!" They followed Jesus, who asked, "What are you seeking?" Andrew and the other disciple (likely John) spent the day with Jesus. This encounter was so transformative that Andrew immediately sought out his brother Simon, declaring, "We have found the Messiah!"
            </p>
<p class="verse-ref">John 1:35-42</p>
</div>

<div class="key-moment">
<h4>2. Bringing Peter to Jesus</h4>
<p style="line-height: 1.8;">
                Andrew's first act after meeting Jesus was to find his brother Simon and bring him to Christ, saying "We have found the Messiah." This single act of evangelism brought the future leader of the Church to Jesus. Andrew thus has the honor of being the first Christian evangelist.
            </p>
<p class="verse-ref">John 1:40-42</p>
</div>

<div class="key-moment">
<h4>3. The Calling as Fisherman</h4>
<p style="line-height: 1.8;">
                Along the Sea of Galilee, Jesus called to Andrew and Peter: "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men." The brothers immediately left their nets and followed Him. This was a formal call to permanent discipleship and apostleship.
            </p>
<p class="verse-ref">Matthew 4:18-20; Mark 1:16-18</p>
</div>

<div class="key-moment">
<h4>4. The Boy with Five Loaves and Two Fish</h4>
<p style="line-height: 1.8;">
                Before the feeding of the 5,000, when Philip despaired of finding enough food, Andrew brought a boy to Jesus who had "five barley loaves and two fish." Though he added, "but what are they for so many?" his act of bringing this small offering to Christ enabled the great miracle. Andrew again demonstrated his role as one who brings people and their resources to Jesus.
            </p>
<p class="verse-ref">John 6:8-9</p>
</div>

<div class="key-moment">
<h4>5. The Greeks Who Wished to See Jesus</h4>
<p style="line-height: 1.8;">
                When Greeks came to Jerusalem for Passover seeking Jesus, they approached Philip. Philip consulted Andrew, and together they brought the Greeks to Jesus. This precipitated Jesus' discourse on His coming glorification: "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified... unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."
            </p>
<p class="verse-ref">John 12:20-22</p>
</div>

<div class="key-moment">
<h4>6. Question About the End Times</h4>
<p style="line-height: 1.8;">
                On the Mount of Olives, Andrew (along with Peter, James, and John) privately asked Jesus about the signs of the end times and the destruction of the Temple. This prompted Jesus' Olivet Discourse on the last days.
            </p>
<p class="verse-ref">Mark 13:3-4</p>
</div>

<h2>Traditional Symbol and Iconography</h2>
<div class="golden-box">
<ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
<li><strong>X-Shaped Cross (Saltire):</strong> The distinctive cross on which Andrew was martyred, now called St. Andrew's Cross. It forms the basis of the Scottish flag and appears in the Union Jack</li>
<li><strong>Fish and Fishing Net:</strong> Representing his original occupation and his call to be a "fisher of men"</li>
<li><strong>Book or Scroll:</strong> Symbolizing his preaching of the Gospel</li>
<li><strong>Transverse Cross:</strong> Sometimes depicted as an X or saltire cross behind him in iconography</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Martyrdom and Death Tradition</h2>
<p style="line-height: 1.8;">
            According to early Christian tradition, Andrew preached throughout Asia Minor, along the Black Sea coast (Scythia, modern-day Ukraine and southern Russia), and in Greece. His missionary journeys were extensive, taking the Gospel to regions that would later become strongholds of Orthodox Christianity.
        </p>
<p style="line-height: 1.8;">
            Andrew was martyred in Patras (Patrae), Greece, around 60-70 CE. The proconsul Aegeas (or Aegeates), angered by Andrew's conversion of his wife Maximilla and his brother Stratocles to Christianity, ordered Andrew's crucifixion. According to tradition, Andrew requested to be crucified on an X-shaped cross (crux decussata) because he felt unworthy to die on the same type of cross as Jesus.
        </p>
<p style="line-height: 1.8;">
            Andrew was bound (not nailed) to the cross and preached to the crowds for two days before dying. His last words were reported to be: "Hail, O Cross; yes, hail indeed! I know that you are made holy by the body of Christ which hung upon you... Receive me, O Cross, and present me to my Master, that He who redeemed me through you may receive me by you."
        </p>

<h2>Legacy and Veneration</h2>
<div class="golden-box">
<h3>Patron Saint of Scotland, Russia, and Greece</h3>
<p style="line-height: 1.8;">
                Andrew is the patron saint of Scotland (the X-cross appears on the Scottish flag), Russia (as the apostle who preached in Scythia), Greece (where he was martyred), and Romania. Churches throughout these regions are dedicated to him.
            </p>

<h3>The First Evangelist</h3>
<p style="line-height: 1.8;">
                Andrew's consistent pattern of bringing people to Jesus—Peter, the boy with loaves, the Greeks—established the model of personal evangelism. His example demonstrates that the primary task of a disciple is not to answer all questions or perform miracles oneself, but to bring people into the presence of Christ.
            </p>

<h3>Bridge to the Gentile World</h3>
<p style="line-height: 1.8;">
                Andrew's role in bringing the Greeks to Jesus foreshadowed the Church's mission to the Gentile world. His Greek name and his openness to Greeks seeking Jesus marked him as uniquely positioned for cross-cultural ministry.
            </p>
