<h2><a class="corpus-link" href="../../babylonian/corpus-search.html" title="View nature in ancient texts">Nature</a> and Description</h2>
<p>
        The Seraphim are the highest order of <a class="inline-search-link" href="../creatures/angels.html">angels</a> in the celestial hierarchy, dwelling in
        the immediate presence of God and serving as caretakers of His throne. Their name means "burning ones," reflecting both their appearance
        (blazing with divine <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Light" data-tradition="christian" href="../../babylonian/corpus-search.html" title="Search corpus for 'Light'">light</a>) and their <a class="corpus-link" href="../../babylonian/corpus-search.html" title="View nature in ancient texts">nature</a> (burning with love for God). According to the prophet
        <a class="inline-search-link" href="#" onclick="performCodexSearch(event, 'isaiah')">Isaiah's</a> vision, each seraph has six wings:
        with two they cover their faces (in reverence before God's glory), with two they cover their feet (in humility), and with two they fly
        (in readiness to serve).
    </p>
<h2><a class="corpus-link" href="../../babylonian/corpus-search.html" title="View biblical in ancient texts">Biblical</a> Appearance</h2>
<h3><a class="corpus-link" data-term="Isaiah" data-tradition="jewish" href="../../babylonian/corpus-search.html" title="Search corpus for 'Isaiah'">Isaiah</a>'s Vision</h3>
<p>
        The seraphim appear in the Book of <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Isaiah" data-tradition="jewish" href="../../babylonian/corpus-search.html" title="Search corpus for 'Isaiah'">Isaiah</a>, chapter 6, during the prophet's throne vision. <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Isaiah" data-tradition="jewish" href="../../babylonian/corpus-search.html" title="Search corpus for 'Isaiah'">Isaiah</a> saw the Lord seated on a high and lofty
        throne, with the train of His robe filling the temple. Above Him stood the seraphim, calling to one another:
    </p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; padding: 15px; ">
        "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts;<br/>
        the whole earth is full of his glory!"
    </p>
<p>
        This threefold declaration of holiness emphasizes God's absolute purity and separateness from all <a class="corpus-link" href="../../babylonian/corpus-search.html" title="View creation in ancient texts">creation</a>. The seraphim's song caused the
        foundations of the temple to shake and the house to fill with smoke. When <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Isaiah" data-tradition="jewish" href="../../babylonian/corpus-search.html" title="Search corpus for 'Isaiah'">Isaiah</a>, overwhelmed by his own sinfulness in the presence of
        holiness, cried out in despair, one of the seraphim flew to him with a burning coal taken from the altar. The seraph touched <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Isaiah" data-tradition="jewish" href="../../babylonian/corpus-search.html" title="Search corpus for 'Isaiah'">Isaiah</a>'s
        lips with the coal, purifying him and declaring his guilt removed and sin atoned for.
    </p>
<h2>Role and Function</h2>
<h3>Worship</h3>
<p>
        The <a class="corpus-link" href="../../babylonian/corpus-search.html" title="View primary in ancient texts">primary</a> function of the seraphim is the perpetual worship of God. They ceaselessly proclaim God's holiness, declaring the
        <em>Trisagion</em> ("Holy, holy, holy"). This threefold repetition is understood by <a class="corpus-link" href="../../babylonian/corpus-search.html" title="View christian tradition in ancient texts">Christian tradition</a> as a reference to the
        <a class="inline-search-link" href="../cosmology/trinity.html">Holy Trinity</a>—<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Father" data-tradition="christian" href="../../babylonian/corpus-search.html" title="Search corpus for 'Father'">Father</a>, Son, and <a class="corpus-link" href="../../babylonian/corpus-search.html" title="View holy spirit in ancient texts">Holy Spirit</a>—each equally deserving
        of the praise "Holy." Their worship is not mere duty but overflowing love; they burn with <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Passion" data-tradition="christian" href="../../babylonian/corpus-search.html" title="Search corpus for 'Passion'">passion</a> for God's glory.
    </p>
<h3>Purification</h3>
<p>
        Seraphim serve as agents of divine purification. In <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Isaiah" data-tradition="jewish" href="../../babylonian/corpus-search.html" title="Search corpus for 'Isaiah'">Isaiah</a>'s vision, a seraph cleansed the prophet's lips with a burning coal, symbolizing
        the purging of sin and the <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Sanctification" data-tradition="christian" href="../../babylonian/corpus-search.html" title="Search corpus for 'Sanctification'">sanctification</a> necessary to stand in God's presence. This purifying fire represents God's holy love that consumes
        all impurity. <a class="corpus-link" href="../../babylonian/corpus-search.html" title="View christian in ancient texts">Christian</a> mystical tradition sees the seraphim as inflaming human hearts with divine love, burning away attachment to sin.
    </p>
<h3>Guardians of the Throne</h3>
<p>
        The seraphim stand at the very throne of God, the closest of all creatures to the <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Divine Presence" data-tradition="jewish" href="../../babylonian/corpus-search.html" title="Search corpus for 'Divine Presence'">divine presence</a>. Their position reflects their supreme
        holiness and their role as guardians of God's majesty. They mediate between the overwhelming holiness of God and the rest of <a class="corpus-link" href="../../babylonian/corpus-search.html" title="View creation in ancient texts">creation</a>,
        veiling His glory so that it does not consume all who approach.
    </p>
<h2><a class="corpus-link" href="../../babylonian/corpus-search.html" title="View theological significance in ancient texts">Theological Significance</a></h2>
<h3>Holiness of God</h3>
<p>
        The seraphim's perpetual cry of "Holy, holy, holy" emphasizes the central attribute of God: His absolute holiness. God's holiness is His
        transcendent purity, His utter separateness from all evil, His perfect moral beauty. The seraphim's own covering of their faces demonstrates
        that even the highest angels cannot fully behold God's unveiled glory. This reveals that God is infinitely beyond all <a class="corpus-link" href="../../babylonian/corpus-search.html" title="View creation in ancient texts">creation</a>.
    </p>
<h3>Love and <a class="corpus-link" href="../../babylonian/corpus-search.html" title="View worship in ancient texts">Worship</a></h3>
<p>
        The seraphim embody perfect love—they are "on fire" with love for God. Their <a class="corpus-link" href="../../babylonian/corpus-search.html" title="View worship in ancient texts">worship</a> is not obligation but ecstatic joy. They model the
        purpose for which all creatures were made: to love God supremely and worship Him eternally. Saint Francis of Assisi was said to have been
        visited by a seraph when he received the stigmata, reflecting the seraphic love that unites the soul to <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Christ" data-tradition="christian" href="../../babylonian/corpus-search.html" title="Search corpus for 'Christ'">Christ</a>'s <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Passion" data-tradition="christian" href="../../babylonian/corpus-search.html" title="Search corpus for 'Passion'">passion</a>.
    </p>
<h3>Celestial Hierarchy</h3>
<p>
        In the writings of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite (5th-6th century), the seraphim occupy the highest rank in the ninefold celestial hierarchy.
        The three highest orders—seraphim, <a class="inline-search-link" href="../creatures/index.html">cherubim</a>, and
        <a class="inline-search-link" href="../../../index.html">thrones</a>—are characterized by their direct contemplation of God and their role as
        channels of <a class="corpus-link" href="../../babylonian/corpus-search.html" title="View divine in ancient texts">divine</a> love, wisdom, and power to the lower orders.
    </p>
<h2>Distinction from Other <a class="corpus-link" href="../../babylonian/corpus-search.html" title="View angels in ancient texts">Angels</a></h2>
<ul class="attribute-list">
<li><strong>vs. <a class="inline-search-link" href="../creatures/index.html">Cherubim</a>:</strong> Seraphim emphasize love and <a class="corpus-link" href="../../babylonian/corpus-search.html" title="View worship in ancient texts">worship</a>; cherubim emphasize knowledge and guarding</li>
<li><strong>vs. <a class="inline-search-link" href="../deities/michael.html">Archangels</a>:</strong> Seraphim remain at God's throne; <a class="corpus-link" href="../../babylonian/corpus-search.html" title="View archangels in ancient texts">archangels</a> are sent on missions to humanity</li>
<li><strong>vs. Regular <a class="inline-search-link" href="../creatures/angels.html">Angels</a>:</strong> Seraphim are of a higher, more glorious order, closer to God</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cultural and Artistic Depictions</h2>
<p>
        In <a class="corpus-link" href="../../babylonian/corpus-search.html" title="View christian in ancient texts">Christian</a> art, seraphim are typically depicted as figures with six wings, often red or golden in color to represent divine fire. They
        may be shown entirely covered by wings, with only a face visible, or in human form surrounded by flames. In iconography, seraphim appear
        around the throne of <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Christ" data-tradition="christian" href="../../babylonian/corpus-search.html" title="Search corpus for 'Christ'">Christ</a>, especially in depictions of the <a class="inline-search-link" href="../cosmology/index.html">Last Judgment</a>
        or the Heavenly Liturgy. Their color is traditionally red, symbolizing <a class="corpus-link" href="../../babylonian/corpus-search.html" title="View divine in ancient texts">divine</a> love and sacrificial fire.

Above him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. And one called to another and said: 'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!' And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke. And I said: 'Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the <a class="corpus-link" data-term="King" data-tradition="christian" href="../../babylonian/corpus-search.html" title="Search corpus for 'King'">King</a>, the Lord of hosts!'
