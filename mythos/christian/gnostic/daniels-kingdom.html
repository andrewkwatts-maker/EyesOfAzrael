                <h2>The Vision of Daniel 2</h2>
                <p>
                    King Nebuchadnezzar dreamed of a great statue with a head of gold, chest of silver, belly of bronze, legs of iron, and feet of iron mixed with clay. Then he saw a <strong>stone cut out without hands</strong> strike the statue's feet, and the entire structure crumbled. That stone then grew into <strong>a great mountain that filled the whole earth</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was no ordinary dream. Daniel revealed that this was a prophecy of kingdoms—and the final kingdom, represented by the stone, is <strong>the Kingdom of Christ</strong> that He established 2000 years ago when He walked among us.

                    <p><strong>Central Truth:</strong> Christ's Kingdom began small—"cut out without hands" (divine origin, not human)—but it is <em>slowly and irresistibly growing</em> until it fills the entire earth and brings <strong>every soul</strong> into the Kingdom. Nobody left behind.</p>

                <p>
                    The stone didn't <em>instantly</em> fill the earth. Daniel saw it <strong>become</strong> a great mountain and then fill the earth—a process, not an instantaneous event. Christ's Kingdom started small (like a mustard seed) and is <strong>steadily, inexorably growing</strong> until it encompasses all creation.

                <h2>⚙️🧱 The Iron and Clay: A Deeper Mystery</h2>

                <div class="scripture-card">
                    <p class="verse">"And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but <strong>they shall not cleave one to another</strong>, even as iron is not mixed with clay."</p>
                    <p class="reference">— Daniel 2:43</p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    The iron and clay in the statue's feet represent kingdoms that are <strong>divided and unable to truly unite</strong>. Iron represents strength and hardness; clay represents fragility and commonness. When mixed together, they create an unstable foundation—which is precisely where the stone strikes.
                </p>

                <h3>🔥 Metallurgical Insight: Clay's Higher Melting Point</h3>
                <div class="insight-box">
                    <p><strong>Physical Reality:</strong> Clay (fired ceramic) has a <em>higher melting point</em> than iron. Iron melts at ~2,800°F (1,538°C), while fired clay can withstand temperatures exceeding 3,000°F (1,650°C).</p>

                    <p><strong>Spiritual Meaning:</strong> When God's refining fire comes (see <a href="refining-fire.html">God's Refining Fire</a>), the iron (human strength, earthly power, rigid systems) will melt away first. The clay (humility, earthly fragility, those who are "nothing" in the world's eyes) endures longer in the fire.</p>

                    <p>This echoes Christ's teaching:</p>
                </div>

                <div class="scripture-card">
                    <p class="verse">"But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first."</p>
                    <p class="reference">— Matthew 19:30</p>
                </div>

                <div class="scripture-card">
                    <p class="verse">"For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called: But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are."</p>

                <p>
                    The clay—the humble, the lowly, the "earthen vessels"—can withstand the refining fire better than the iron of worldly strength and power.

                    We are living <em>during</em> the growth of the stone into the mountain. Christ's Kingdom was established 2000 years ago and has been steadily expanding ever since. It grows through:

                    The vision of Daniel's stone filling <strong>the whole earth</strong> is God's promise that <em>everyone</em> will ultimately be brought into His Kingdom. Not by force, but by the irresistible power of His love breaking through every barrier, melting every resistance, and winning every heart.

                <h2>🌟 Conclusion: Trust the Vision</h2>

                <p>
                    Daniel's prophecy of the stone cut out without hands is one of the most beautiful promises in all of Scripture. Christ came. Christ established His Kingdom. And that Kingdom is <strong>inexorably, unstoppably growing</strong> until it fills every corner of creation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The world's empires—Babylon, Persia, Greece, Rome, and all that followed—rise and fall like chaff blown by the wind. But Christ's Kingdom <strong>stands forever</strong> and will not be given to another people. It belongs to God, and God's love will not rest until all creation is safely home.
                </p>

                <div class="scripture-card large">
                    <p class="verse">"And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, <strong>The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.</strong>"</p>

                <p class="closing-truth">
                    Be patient. Trust the process. The stone is becoming a mountain. And when the mountain has filled the whole earth, not one soul will be left behind. 🌍⛰️❤️
