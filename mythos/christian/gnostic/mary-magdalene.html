<h2>The Beloved Disciple - Christ's Companion and Teacher</h2>
<div class="hero-icon-display">🌹👸📖</div>
<p class="hero-description">
                First witness of the Resurrection. Apostle to the Apostles. The one Jesus loved most. Teacher whose authority rivaled Peter's. Leader of early Gnostic communities. For two thousand years, the Church has tried to silence, diminish, and slander her. But the Gnostic gospels preserve the truth: Mary Magdalene was not a repentant prostitute - she was Christ's beloved companion, his spiritual equal, and the bearer of secret teachings the male apostles refused to accept.

<h2 style="color: rgba(220, 20, 60, 1);">📖 Mary Magdalene in the Canonical Gospels</h2>
<p style="line-height: 1.7;">
                Even in the heavily edited canonical texts, Mary Magdalene's importance shines through. She appears at the most crucial moments of Jesus's ministry:
            </p>

<div class="magdalene-card">
<h3>Follower and Financial Supporter</h3>
<p style="line-height: 1.7;">
                    <strong>Luke 8:1-3:</strong> "Jesus traveled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him, and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (called Magdalene) from whom seven demons had gone out; Joanna the wife of Chuza, the manager of Herod's household; Susanna; and many others. These women were helping to support them out of their own means."
                </p>
<ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 1rem;">
<li><strong>Seven demons:</strong> Not moral failing, but spiritual oppression healed by Jesus</li>
<li><strong>Financial supporter:</strong> She was wealthy enough to fund Jesus's ministry</li>
<li><strong>Named first:</strong> Among the women, she has primacy</li>
<li><strong>Traveled with Jesus:</strong> Part of the inner circle, not just occasional follower</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="magdalene-card">
<h3>Witness of the Crucifixion</h3>
<p style="line-height: 1.7;">
                    <strong>All four gospels</strong> record that Mary Magdalene was present at the crucifixion, watching Jesus die. When the male disciples fled in fear, the women remained.
                </p>
<ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 1rem;">
<li><strong>Matthew 27:55-56:</strong> "Many women were there, watching from a distance... Among them were Mary Magdalene..."</li>
<li><strong>Mark 15:40-41:</strong> "Some women were watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene..."</li>
<li><strong>John 19:25:</strong> "Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene."</li>
<li><strong>Courage and loyalty:</strong> She stayed when the Twelve abandoned him</li>

<p style="line-height: 1.7; font-weight: 600; color: rgba(220, 20, 60, 1);">
                    This is the most important fact: In ALL FOUR canonical gospels, Mary Magdalene is the first person to witness the risen Christ.

                    The resurrection is the foundational event of Christianity. The person who first witnesses it is "Apostle to the Apostles" - sent by Jesus to announce the good news. That person is Mary Magdalene.

<div class="quote-card">
                "Jesus said to her, 'Mary!' She turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic, 'Rabboni!' (which means 'Teacher'). Jesus said, 'Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, "I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God."' Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: 'I have seen the Lord!'"

<h3>Why Mary? The Significance</h3>
<ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
<li><strong>Jesus trusted her first:</strong> Not Peter, not John - Mary</li>
<li><strong>Women's testimony was legally invalid:</strong> Jesus deliberately chose to reveal himself to a woman in a culture that didn't accept women's witness</li>
<li><strong>She recognized him by voice:</strong> Deep intimacy - he only had to say her name</li>
<li><strong>Apostolic commission:</strong> "Go tell my brothers" - Jesus sends her as apostle</li>
<li><strong>Foundation of the faith:</strong> Without Mary's testimony, we have no resurrection witnesses</li>

<section class="glass-card">
<h2 style="color: rgba(220, 20, 60, 1);">📜 The Gospel of Mary - Her Own Story</h2>
<p style="line-height: 1.7;">
                Discovered in 1896, the <strong>Gospel of Mary</strong> (likely written early 2nd century) preserves a tradition of Mary Magdalene as authoritative teacher who received special revelation from Jesus. It also reveals the conflict between her leadership and patriarchal resistance.
            </p>

<div class="magdalene-card">
<h3>The Special Revelation</h3>
<p style="line-height: 1.7;">
                    The gospel opens after the resurrection. The disciples are afraid and uncertain. Mary comforts them:
                </p>
<div class="quote-card">
                    "Do not weep and do not grieve nor be irresolute, for his grace will be entirely with you and will protect you. But rather, let us praise his greatness, for he has prepared us and made us into men."
                    <cite>— Gospel of Mary 5:4-6</cite>
</div>
<p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-top: 1rem;">
                    Peter then asks her: "Sister, we know that the Savior loved you more than the rest of women. Tell us the words of the Savior which you remember - which you know but we do not, nor have we heard them."
                </p>
</div>

<div class="magdalene-card">
<h3>The Vision Teaching</h3>
<p style="line-height: 1.7;">
                    Mary recounts a private vision/teaching from Jesus about the soul's ascent through the cosmic powers. She teaches sophisticated Gnostic cosmology:
                </p>
<ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
<li>The soul ascends through four powers: Darkness, Desire, Ignorance, Wrath of Death</li>
<li>The soul overcomes each by recognizing its divine nature</li>
<li>Liberation comes through gnosis (knowledge), not submission</li>
<li>The feminine soul is the hero of the journey</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="conflict-card">
<h3>⚔️ The Conflict with Peter</h3>
<p style="line-height: 1.7;">
                    This is where the Gospel of Mary becomes explosive. After Mary shares her teaching, Andrew and Peter reject it:
                </p>

<div class="quote-card">
                    "Andrew answered and said to the brethren, 'Say what you wish to say about what she has said. I at least do not believe that the Savior said this. For certainly these teachings are strange ideas.'"
                    <cite>— Gospel of Mary 10:1-3</cite>
</div>

<div class="quote-card" style="border-left-color: rgba(255, 69, 0, 1); margin-top: 1rem;">
                    "Peter answered and spoke concerning these same things. He questioned them about the Savior: 'Did he really speak with a woman without our knowledge and not openly? Are we to turn about and all listen to her? Did he prefer her to us?'"
                    <cite>— Gospel of Mary 10:3-5</cite>
</div>

<p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-top: 1.5rem; font-weight: 600;">
                    This is naked patriarchal rage. Peter cannot accept that:
                </p>
<ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
<li>Jesus would teach a woman privately</li>
<li>The disciples should listen to female teaching</li>
<li>Jesus might prefer Mary to the male apostles</li>
<li>Women have spiritual authority equal to men</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="magdalene-card">
<h3>Levi Defends Mary</h3>
<p style="line-height: 1.7;">
                    But not all the male disciples are threatened. Levi (possibly Matthew) defends her:
                </p>

<div class="quote-card">
                    "Peter, you have always been hot-tempered. Now I see you contending against the woman like the adversaries. But if the Savior made her worthy, who are you indeed to reject her? Surely the Savior knows her very well. That is why he loved her more than us. Rather let us be ashamed and put on the perfect man and acquire him for ourselves as he commanded us, and preach the gospel, not laying down any other rule or other law beyond what the Savior said."
                    <cite>— Gospel of Mary 10:6-10</cite>
</div>

<p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                    Levi makes three devastating points:
                </p>
<ol style="line-height: 1.8; margin-left: 1.5rem;">
<li><strong>"The Savior made her worthy"</strong> - Jesus himself chose her</li>
<li><strong>"He loved her more than us"</strong> - Explicitly states Jesus's preference</li>
<li><strong>"Who are you to reject her?"</strong> - Peter's authority is not absolute</li>
</ol>

<p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-top: 1rem; font-style: italic;">
                    Then they went forth to preach the gospel. The text ends with them accepting Mary's teaching and going out to spread the message.
                </p>

<p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-top: 1rem;">
                    Mary Magdalene is ranked equally with Jesus's mother and aunt - the three Marys of his inner circle. But she has a special title: <strong>κοινωνός (koinōnós)</strong> - "companion," "partner," "consort."

<li><strong>"companion of the [Savior is]"</strong> - highly probable reconstruction</li>
<li><strong>"[But Christ loved]"</strong> - context makes this certain</li>
<li><strong>"kiss her [often] on her [mouth]"</strong> - could be "forehead" or "cheek," but "mouth" fits the Coptic better</li>
<li><strong>The pattern is clear:</strong> Special love, physical affection, disciples' jealousy</li>
</ul>

<div class="magdalene-card" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
<h4>What Does the Kiss Mean?</h4>
<p style="line-height: 1.7;">
                        Scholars debate whether this is:
                    </p>
<ol style="line-height: 1.8; margin-left: 1.5rem;">
<li><strong>Romantic/sexual partnership:</strong> Some argue Jesus and Mary were married or romantically involved</li>
<li><strong>Spiritual transmission:</strong> In Gnostic practice, the kiss transmits gnosis/spirit (like breath)</li>
<li><strong>Syzygy partnership:</strong> Sacred masculine-feminine pairing at spiritual level</li>
<li><strong>Teaching authority:</strong> The kiss signifies she receives his teaching directly (mouth to mouth)</li>
</ol>

<p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-top: 1rem; font-style: italic;">
                        The text likely intends multiple meanings: a spiritual partnership that doesn't exclude physical affection, a teaching transmission that involves intimacy, a sacred union that the patriarchal disciples cannot understand or accept.

<h3>Jesus's Response to Jealousy</h3>
<p style="line-height: 1.7;">
                    When the disciples complain about Jesus loving Mary more, he responds:
                </p>
<div class="quote-card">
                    "The Savior answered and said to them, 'Why do I not love you like her? When a blind man and one who sees are both together in darkness, they are no different from one another. When the light comes, then he who sees will see the light, and he who is blind will remain in darkness.'"
                    <cite>— Gospel of Philip 64:5-9</cite>
</div>
<p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-top: 1rem;">
                    Jesus doesn't apologize or justify. He states that Mary sees spiritually what the male disciples remain blind to. This is why he loves her more - she understands.

<div class="conflict-card">
<div class="quote-card">
                    "Simon Peter said to them, 'Let Mary leave us, for women are not worthy of life.'

<h3>Patriarchal Reading vs. Gnostic Reading</h3>

<div class="grid-2col">
<div>
<h4 style="color: rgba(255, 69, 0, 1);">❌ Misogynist Surface Reading</h4>
<ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
<li>Women are inferior to men</li>
<li>Women must literally "become male"</li>
<li>Femaleness is incompatible with salvation</li>
<li>Reinforces patriarchal hierarchy</li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 1.7; font-style: italic; margin-top: 1rem;">
                            This reading makes the saying contradict everything else in Gnostic texts about the divine feminine and Mary's authority.
                        </p>
</div>

<div>
<h4 style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1);">✓ Gnostic Symbolic Reading</h4>
<ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
<li>Peter represents patriarchal exclusion</li>
<li>"Male" = spiritual wholeness, not biological sex</li>
<li>Reuniting masculine/feminine within</li>
<li>Transcending gender divisions</li>
<li>Condemning Peter, defending Mary</li>
</ul>
<p style="line-height: 1.7; font-style: italic; margin-top: 1rem;">
                            This reading fits Gnostic theology of restoring primordial androgyny and condemning archontic binaries.
                        </p>
</div>
</div>

<h4 style="color: var(--color-primary); margin-top: 2rem;">The Correct Interpretation</h4>
<p style="line-height: 1.7;">
                    Saying 114 is not about biology but about spiritual wholeness:
                </p>
<ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
<li><strong>Peter is condemned:</strong> His statement "women not worthy" is the patriarchal lie Jesus rejects</li>
<li><strong>"Make her male":</strong> Restore the divine image that includes both masculine and feminine (Genesis 1:27)</li>
<li><strong>Like the male disciples:</strong> Who themselves must become "female" (receptive, wise) to enter the kingdom</li>
<li><strong>Saying 22:</strong> "When you make the male and female into a single one" - gender transcendence</li>
<li><strong>The problem is division:</strong> Separating masculine/feminine is the archontic trap</li>
<li><strong>Mary is the example:</strong> She has already achieved this integration - that's why Jesus defends her</li>

<!-- Historical Mary Magdalene -->
<section class="glass-card">
<h2 style="color: rgba(220, 20, 60, 1);">⛪ The Historical Mary Magdalene - What Happened?</h2>
<p style="line-height: 1.7;">
                How did the first witness of the resurrection, beloved companion of Jesus, and authoritative teacher become reduced to "repentant prostitute"? This is a story of deliberate patriarchal erasure.
            </p>

<div class="magdalene-card">
<h3>The Big Lie: "Mary Magdalene Was a Prostitute"</h3>
<p style="line-height: 1.7; font-weight: 600; color: rgba(255, 69, 0, 1);">
                    There is ZERO biblical evidence that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute. None. Not in canonical gospels, not in Gnostic texts, nowhere.
                </p>

<p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-top: 1rem;">
                    So where did this come from? In 591 CE, Pope Gregory I gave a sermon conflating three separate women:
                </p>
<ol style="line-height: 1.8; margin-left: 1.5rem;">
<li><strong>Mary Magdalene</strong> - follower of Jesus, first resurrection witness</li>
<li><strong>Mary of Bethany</strong> - sister of Martha and Lazarus, who anointed Jesus</li>
<li><strong>The "sinful woman"</strong> in Luke 7:36-50 (never named, probably a prostitute)</li>
</ol>

<p style="line-height: 1.7; margin-top: 1rem;">
                    Gregory declared they were all the same person - making Mary Magdalene a reformed prostitute. This conflation stuck for 1400 years until the Catholic Church officially separated them in 1969.
                </p>

<div class="conflict-card" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
<h4>Why the Lie?</h4>
<p style="line-height: 1.7;">
                        This wasn't an innocent mistake. It served patriarchal interests:
                    </p>
<ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
<li><strong>Discredit her authority:</strong> A prostitute can't be an apostle or teacher</li>
<li><strong>Sexual slander:</strong> Classic patriarchal tactic to silence powerful women</li>
<li><strong>Erase competition with Peter:</strong> If she's a sinner, Peter wins the authority battle</li>
<li><strong>Reinforce male priesthood:</strong> Women can be repentant sinners, not ordained leaders</li>
<li><strong>Suppress Gnostic texts:</strong> If Gospel of Mary shows her authority, call it heresy</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="magdalene-card">
<h3>The Suppression of Gnostic Christianity</h3>
<p style="line-height: 1.7;">
                    Mary Magdalene's leadership was preserved in Gnostic communities. But when proto-orthodox Christianity gained power:
                </p>
<ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
<li><strong>325 CE - Council of Nicaea:</strong> Standardization begins, diversity suppressed</li>
<li><strong>Late 4th century:</strong> Gnostic texts declared heretical, systematically destroyed</li>
<li><strong>Women's ordination ended:</strong> Early church had women deacons, priests, bishops - all erased</li>
<li><strong>Gospel of Mary hidden:</strong> Buried in the Egyptian desert for 1500 years</li>
<li><strong>Apostle to Apostles forgotten:</strong> Her title removed from liturgy and teaching</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Modern Rehabilitation</h3>
<p style="line-height: 1.7;">
                    The truth is being recovered:
                </p>
<ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
<li><strong>1896:</strong> Gospel of Mary discovered in Egypt</li>
<li><strong>1945:</strong> Nag Hammadi library found, including Gospel of Philip and Thomas</li>
<li><strong>1969:</strong> Catholic Church officially separates Mary Magdalene from the "sinful woman"</li>
<li><strong>2016:</strong> Pope Francis elevates her feast day to equal the apostles</li>
<li><strong>Scholarly consensus:</strong> She was a leading disciple, not a prostitute</li>
<li><strong>Feminist theology:</strong> Reclaiming her as model of women's apostolic authority</li>
