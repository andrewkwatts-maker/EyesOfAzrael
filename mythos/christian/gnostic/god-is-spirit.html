            <p style="font-size: var(--text-lg); line-height: var(--leading-relaxed); margin-bottom: var(--space-6);">
                The Bible is crystal clear: <span class="emphasis-text">God is Spirit, not flesh</span>. This is not metaphorical or poetic—it is direct, explicit, fundamental truth about God's nature. Yet we've buried this truth under centuries of false images and physical representations.
            </p>

                <p class="scripture-verse">

                <span class="scripture-ref">— John 4:24</span>
            </div>

            <p style="line-height: var(--leading-relaxed); margin-top: var(--space-4);">
                Jesus spoke these words to the Samaritan woman, teaching the most fundamental truth about worship: God is not physical, God is not localized in temples or mountains, God is SPIRIT. True worship must therefore be spiritual—internal, not external; in spirit and truth, not in physical rituals and images.
            </p>

            <div class="scripture-block">
                <p class="scripture-verse">
                    "Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty."

                <span class="scripture-ref">— 2 Corinthians 3:17</span>
            </div>

            <p style="line-height: var(--leading-relaxed); margin-top: var(--space-4);">
                Paul explicitly identifies the Lord (God) as SPIRIT. This is not one attribute among many—this IS what God is. And where this Spirit is recognized, there is LIBERTY—freedom from external religious bondage, from physical images, from material worship systems.
            </p>

            <div class="scripture-block">
                <p class="scripture-verse">
                    "It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life."

                <span class="scripture-ref">— John 6:63</span>

            <p style="line-height: var(--leading-relaxed); margin-top: var(--space-4);">
                Christ declares: "The flesh profiteth NOTHING." Physical, material, external religion is worthless. The Spirit gives life. God's word is spirit and life—not flesh and ritual. This demolishes all physical religion built on external forms.

            <p style="font-size: var(--text-lg); line-height: var(--leading-relaxed); margin-bottom: var(--space-6);">
                If God is Spirit, then God has NO physical body, NO visible form. This is why the Second Commandment absolutely forbids making ANY image or likeness of God. Yet what have we done? We've created countless images of God as an old man with a white beard, sitting on a throne—directly violating God's clearest command.

Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire: Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female."

                Notice the emphasis: <span class="emphasis-text">"Ye saw NO similitude"</span>—they saw NO form, NO shape, NO image. They heard a VOICE (spiritual) but saw NO physical appearance. Why? Because God has no physical form to see! Making any image—especially "the likeness of male or female"—is corruption, violation, idolatry.

                God is a "consuming FIRE"—not a physical man! Fire is used as metaphor for God's spiritual nature: invisible, powerful, transforming, not containable in physical form.

                God asks rhetorically: What image can you make of Me? What comparison is adequate? The answer: NONE. Any attempt to depict God in physical form is inherently false, inherently idolatrous, inherently a violation of God's nature and command.

                The New Testament repeatedly, emphatically declares: <span class="emphasis-text">NO MAN has seen God at any time</span>. This isn't a temporary state—it's impossible. God, being Spirit, has no physical form to see with physical eyes.

                Even Moses—who spoke with God "face to face" (meaning intimately, spiritually)—was told he could not see God's face physically and live. Why? Because God has no physical face to see! The "face" is metaphorical for God's presence, God's nature—which is spiritual, not physical.

                    Every painting of God as an old man with a white beard—whether on the Sistine Chapel ceiling or in Sunday School materials—is a direct violation of Exodus 20:4 and Deuteronomy 4:15-16. We've made God in OUR image (old, male, physical) rather than understanding we're made in God's image (spiritual, bearing divine attributes of love, wisdom, creativity).

                        Perhaps the most famous violation: God depicted as an old man with white hair and beard, physically touching Adam. Beautiful art—but complete idolatry. God has NO physical form, NO age, NO gender, NO fingers to physically touch with.

                        From earliest childhood, we teach children to picture God as a grandfather figure sitting on a cloud. We embed physical idolatry before they can even read Scripture for themselves.

                    By imagining God as a physical being—even an exalted one—we've reduced the infinite to finite, the omnipresent to localized, the spiritual to material. We've taken the God who "fills heaven and earth" and shrunk Him to a throne in one location.

                    This is not elevation of God—it's degradation. The "God" sitting on a throne, physically watching us from heaven, is not the true God of Scripture. It's the Demiurge—the limited creator-god who doesn't know he's limited, who thinks he's supreme because he can't see beyond physical creation to the infinite Spirit above.

                    This means humans bear God's IMAGE—not that God has human physical form! We bear divine attributes: creativity, love, reason, spiritual nature. But we've reversed this: instead of understanding ourselves as bearing God's spiritual image, we've made God in OUR physical image—male, aged, bodily.

                    The incarnation was God's Spirit entering physical creation to reveal spiritual truth. But the body was a VESSEL, not the essence. Christ was crucified in the flesh, raised in the Spirit (1 Peter 3:18). The physical was shed; the spiritual remains eternal.

                    Stop depicting God as an old man, as any physical form. This is idolatry, plain and simple. God has NO form to depict. Every image is a lie and a violation.
                </p>

                <h4 style="color: #22c55e; margin-top: var(--space-6);">2. Understand "Image of God" Spiritually</h4>
                <p style="line-height: var(--leading-relaxed);">
                    We bear God's IMAGE (spiritual attributes: love, creativity, reason) but God does NOT have our physical form. The image is spiritual, not physical.
                </p>

                <h4 style="color: #22c55e; margin-top: var(--space-6);">3. Recognize God's Omnipresence</h4>
                <p style="line-height: var(--leading-relaxed);">
                    God is not "up there" on a throne in one location. God, being Spirit, is omnipresent—"in Him we live and move and have our being." God is closer than your breath, within your heart, filling all space.
                </p>

                <h4 style="color: #22c55e; margin-top: var(--space-6);">4. Cultivate Spiritual Vision</h4>
                <p style="line-height: var(--leading-relaxed);">
                    "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God." Develop the inner eye, the spiritual sight that perceives invisible realities. This is gnosis—spiritual knowledge of spiritual truth.
                </p>

                <h4 style="color: #22c55e; margin-top: var(--space-6);">5. Practice Internal Worship</h4>
                <p style="line-height: var(--leading-relaxed);">
                    "Go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret." (Matthew 6:6) Worship is not about external location or physical ritual—it's about internal communion with the Spirit dwelling within you.
                </p>

                <h4 style="color: #22c55e; margin-top: var(--space-6);">6. Transcend Gender Categories for God</h4>
                <p style="line-height: var(--leading-relaxed);">
                    God is Spirit—not male, not female, transcending human gender categories. While Scripture uses masculine language (Father) and feminine language (Wisdom/Sophia), God is beyond gender. Clinging to "God as male" is idolatry.
