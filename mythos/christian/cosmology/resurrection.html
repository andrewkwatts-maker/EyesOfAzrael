<h2>The <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View resurrection in ancient texts">Resurrection</a> of Christ</h2>
<h3>The Historical Event</h3>
<p>
The <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View resurrection in ancient texts">resurrection</a> of <a class="inline-search-link" href="../deities/jesus_christ.html">Jesus Christ</a> is the cornerstone of Christian <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Faith" data-tradition="christian" href="corpus-search.html" title="Search corpus for 'Faith'">faith</a>. Three days after His crucifixion and burial, <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View jesus in ancient texts">Jesus</a> rose bodily from the dead, conquering death and vindicating His claims to be the Son of God. The tomb was found empty, the grave clothes left behind, and <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View jesus in ancient texts">Jesus</a> appeared alive to numerous witnesses over forty days—to Mary Magdalene, to the disciples, to more than five hundred people at once.
</p>
<p>
This was not a spiritual <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View resurrection in ancient texts">resurrection</a> or metaphorical rising, but a bodily, physical <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View resurrection in ancient texts">resurrection</a>. The risen <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View christ in ancient texts">Christ</a> ate food, invited Thomas to touch His wounds, and walked with the disciples. Yet His resurrection body was also transformed—He could appear in locked rooms, was not always immediately recognized, and ultimately ascended to <a class="inline-search-link" href="heaven.html">Heaven</a>. It was the same body that died, but now glorified and immortal.
</p>

<h3>The Evidence</h3>
<p>
The New <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View testament in ancient texts">Testament</a> presents multiple lines of evidence for the <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View resurrection in ancient texts">resurrection</a>: the empty tomb discovered by women (whose testimony was not valued in that culture, making it an unlikely fabrication), the transformation of the disciples from fearful fugitives to bold proclaimers willing to die for their testimony, the conversion of skeptics like <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Paul" data-tradition="christian" href="corpus-search.html" title="Search corpus for 'Paul'">Paul</a> and James, and the rapid spread of Christianity despite persecution.
</p>
<p>
<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Paul" data-tradition="christian" href="corpus-search.html" title="Search corpus for 'Paul'">Paul</a> staked the entire Christian <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Faith" data-tradition="christian" href="corpus-search.html" title="Search corpus for 'Faith'">faith</a> on the <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View resurrection in ancient texts">resurrection</a>: "If <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View christ in ancient texts">Christ</a> has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Faith" data-tradition="christian" href="corpus-search.html" title="Search corpus for 'Faith'">faith</a> is in vain... If <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View christ in ancient texts">Christ</a> has not been raised, your <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Faith" data-tradition="christian" href="corpus-search.html" title="Search corpus for 'Faith'">faith</a> is futile and you are still in your sins." The <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View resurrection in ancient texts">resurrection</a> is not peripheral but central—Christianity stands or falls on its truth.
</p>

<h2>The Meaning of Christ's <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View resurrection in ancient texts">Resurrection</a></h2>
<h3>Victory Over Death</h3>
<p>
Christ's <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View resurrection in ancient texts">resurrection</a> demonstrates His victory over death, the last enemy. Death, which entered the world through sin, has been conquered. As <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Paul" data-tradition="christian" href="corpus-search.html" title="Search corpus for 'Paul'">Paul</a> triumphantly declares, "Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?" The <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View resurrection in ancient texts">resurrection</a> shows that death is not the end—it is a defeated foe, a conquered enemy.
</p>

<h3>Proof of Deity and Authority</h3>
<p>
The <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View resurrection in ancient texts">resurrection</a> vindicated <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View jesus in ancient texts">Jesus</a>' claims to be the Son of God. It proved that His sacrifice on the <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Cross" data-tradition="christian" href="corpus-search.html" title="Search corpus for 'Cross'">cross</a> was accepted by the <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View father in ancient texts">Father</a>, that His <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View death in ancient texts">death</a> accomplished <a class="inline-search-link" href="../cosmology/salvation.html">salvation</a>, and that He has authority over life and death. <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Paul" data-tradition="christian" href="corpus-search.html" title="Search corpus for 'Paul'">Paul</a> writes that <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View jesus in ancient texts">Jesus</a> "was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View resurrection in ancient texts">resurrection</a> from the dead."
</p>

<h3>Guarantee of Believers' <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View resurrection in ancient texts">Resurrection</a></h3>
<p>
Christ is called "the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep." His <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View resurrection in ancient texts">resurrection</a> is the guarantee and pattern for the <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View resurrection in ancient texts">resurrection</a> of all believers. Because He lives, we will live also. The same power that raised <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View christ in ancient texts">Christ</a> from the dead will raise believers to eternal life. This provides hope in the face of death and comfort in times of grief.
</p>

<h2>The Future <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View resurrection in ancient texts">Resurrection</a></h2>
<h3>The General <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View resurrection in ancient texts">Resurrection</a></h3>
<p>
Christian theology teaches that at Christ's second coming, there will be a general <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View resurrection in ancient texts">resurrection</a> of the dead. All who have died—both the righteous and the wicked—will be raised bodily to face the <a class="inline-search-link" href="last_judgment.html">Last Judgment</a>. <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View jesus in ancient texts">Jesus</a> taught, "An hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice and come out, those who have done good to the <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View resurrection in ancient texts">resurrection</a> of life, and those who have done evil to the <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View resurrection in ancient texts">resurrection</a> of judgment."
</p>

<h3>The Resurrection Body</h3>
<p>
<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Paul" data-tradition="christian" href="corpus-search.html" title="Search corpus for 'Paul'">Paul</a> explains that believers will receive resurrection bodies like Christ's glorified body. These will be the same bodies we now have, but transformed and perfected. He uses the analogy of a seed: what is sown is perishable, what is raised is imperishable; what is sown in dishonor is raised in glory; what is sown in weakness is raised in power; what is sown a natural body is raised a spiritual body.
</p>
<p>
The resurrection body will be:
</p>
<ul class="attribute-list">
<li><strong>Immortal:</strong> No longer subject to death, decay, or disease</li>
<li><strong>Incorruptible:</strong> Perfect, without flaw or weakness</li>
<li><strong>Glorious:</strong> Reflecting God's glory like <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View christ in ancient texts">Christ</a> on the Mount of Transfiguration</li>
<li><strong>Powerful:</strong> Not limited by current physical constraints</li>
<li><strong>Spiritual:</strong> Animated by the Spirit, suited for eternal life</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Transformation of the Living</h3>
<p>
<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Paul" data-tradition="christian" href="corpus-search.html" title="Search corpus for 'Paul'">Paul</a> reveals a mystery: not all will die, but all will be transformed. When <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View christ in ancient texts">Christ</a> returns, those who are alive will be changed "in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye." They will receive their resurrection bodies without experiencing death. "For this perishable body must put on the imperishable, and this mortal body must put on immortality."
</p>

<h2>Theological and Practical Implications</h2>
<h3>Redemption of the Physical</h3>
<p>
The doctrine of bodily <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View resurrection in ancient texts">resurrection</a> affirms that God's salvation extends to the whole person, body and soul. Christianity does not teach escape from the body but redemption of the body. This opposes Greek dualism that viewed matter as evil and spirit as good. God created the physical world good, and He will redeem it. The <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View resurrection in ancient texts">resurrection</a> validates the importance of the body and physical creation.
</p>

<h3>Hope in Suffering</h3>
<p>
The promise of <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View resurrection in ancient texts">resurrection</a> gives Christians hope in the face of suffering, disease, and death. Present afflictions are temporary; the resurrection body will be free from all pain and imperfection. <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Paul" data-tradition="christian" href="corpus-search.html" title="Search corpus for 'Paul'">Paul</a> writes, "I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us."
</p>

<h3>Motivation for Faithfulness</h3>
<p>
Belief in the <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View resurrection in ancient texts">resurrection</a> motivates Christian faithfulness and service. <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Paul" data-tradition="christian" href="corpus-search.html" title="Search corpus for 'Paul'">Paul</a> concludes his great chapter on <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View resurrection in ancient texts">resurrection</a> with practical exhortation: "Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain." Because the <a class="corpus-link" href="corpus-search.html" title="View resurrection in ancient texts">resurrection</a> is real, our work for God has eternal significance.
