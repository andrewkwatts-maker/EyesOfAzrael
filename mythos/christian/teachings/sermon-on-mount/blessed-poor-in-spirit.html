    <h2>🔤 Word Study: "Poor in Spirit"</h2>
    <div class="glass-card">
        <h3 style="color: gold;">Greek: πτωχοὶ τῷ πνεύματι (ptōchoi tō pneumati)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>πτωχός (ptōchos)</strong> - Poor, destitute, beggar. Not just "lacking" but utterly dependent, having nothing. A beggar who must rely entirely on others for survival.</li>
            <li><strong>τῷ πνεύματι (tō pneumati)</strong> - "In spirit" - This qualifies the poverty. Not material poverty, but spiritual poverty - recognizing one's complete spiritual bankruptcy before God.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="color: gold; margin-top: 2rem;">What It Means</h3>
        <p><strong>Poor in spirit</strong> means recognizing that before God, we have nothing to offer, no righteousness of our own, no merit to claim. We are spiritual beggars, utterly dependent on God's grace. It is the opposite of spiritual pride, self-sufficiency, or self-righteousness.</p>

        <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid gold; padding-left: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; font-style: italic;">
            "The poor in spirit are those who know they are spiritually bankrupt. They have no resources of their own to commend them to God. They cast themselves entirely on his mercy." - John Stott

    <h2>👑 The Promise: "Theirs Is the Kingdom of Heaven"</h2>
    <div class="glass-card">
        <p>Notice the verb: "theirs <strong>IS</strong>" (present tense). The kingdom is not a future reward for the poor in spirit - it belongs to them <em>now</em>. Why?</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Because <strong>the kingdom of heaven is entered by grace alone</strong>. Those who recognize their spiritual poverty are the ones who receive God's kingdom as a gift. The self-righteous, who think they have spiritual riches, exclude themselves.</p>

        <ul style="line-height: 2; margin-top: 1rem;">
            <li><strong>Luke 18:9-14</strong> - The Pharisee and the tax collector: The tax collector, poor in spirit ("God, have mercy on me, a sinner"), went home justified.</li>
            <li><strong>Matthew 18:3-4</strong> - "Unless you become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom"</li>
            <li><strong>Revelation 3:17</strong> - The Laodiceans thought they were rich but were "wretched, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked"</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>📖 Old Testament Background</h2>
    <div class="glass-card">
        <h3 style="color: var(--color-primary);">The "Poor" (Anawim) in the Psalms</h3>
        <p>The Hebrew concept of <em>anawim</em> (the poor, humble, afflicted) runs through the Psalms and Prophets - those who are materially and spiritually lowly, who cry out to God in dependence:</p>

        <div class="cross-ref">
            <strong>Psalm 51:17</strong> - "My sacrifice, O God, is a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart you, God, will not despise."
        </div>

        <div class="cross-ref">
            <strong>Isaiah 57:15</strong> - "For this is what the high and exalted One says— he who lives forever, whose name is holy: 'I live in a high and holy place, but also with the one who is contrite and lowly in spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly and to revive the heart of the contrite.'"
        </div>

        <div class="cross-ref">
            <strong>Isaiah 66:2</strong> - "These are the ones I look on with favor: those who are humble and contrite in spirit, and who tremble at my word."
        </div>

        <div class="cross-ref">
            <strong>Psalm 34:18</strong> - "The LORD is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit."
        </div>

        <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem; font-style: italic;">God consistently exalts the humble and opposes the proud. The poor in spirit are those who recognize their need and cry out to God.</p>

    <h2>✝️ How Jesus Embodied This Beatitude</h2>
    <div class="glass-card" style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(255, 215, 0, 0.1), rgba(var(--color-primary-rgb), 0.1));">
        <p>Jesus is the ultimate example of poverty in spirit:</p>

        <div class="cross-ref">
            <strong>Philippians 2:6-8</strong> - "Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death—even death on a cross!"
        </div>

        <div class="cross-ref">
            <strong>Matthew 11:29</strong> - "Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls."
        </div>

        <div class="cross-ref">
            <strong>2 Corinthians 8:9</strong> - "For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich."
        </div>

        <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Jesus, though he was God, emptied himself and took the position of a servant. He had every right to glory but chose humility. He is poor in spirit in his incarnation and self-emptying.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>🛠️ Practical Application</h2>
    <div class="glass-card">
        <h3 style="color: var(--color-primary);">How Do We Become Poor in Spirit?</h3>
        <ol style="line-height: 2;">
            <li><strong>Recognize your sinfulness</strong> - See yourself as God sees you: a sinner in desperate need of grace (Romans 3:23)</li>
            <li><strong>Abandon self-righteousness</strong> - Stop relying on your own goodness, morality, or religious achievements (Philippians 3:8-9)</li>
            <li><strong>Depend entirely on God's mercy</strong> - Cast yourself on God's grace like the tax collector: "God, have mercy on me, a sinner" (Luke 18:13)</li>
            <li><strong>Receive the kingdom as a gift</strong> - Stop trying to earn it; receive it like a child (Mark 10:15)</li>
            <li><strong>Cultivate humility</strong> - Recognize your ongoing need for God's grace every day (James 4:6)</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 style="color: var(--color-primary); margin-top: 2rem;">Signs You Are Growing in This Beatitude</h3>
        <ul style="line-height: 2;">
            <li>You are quick to confess sin and slow to justify yourself</li>
            <li>You are not offended when your faults are pointed out</li>
            <li>You rejoice when others succeed, even when you fail</li>
            <li>You depend on prayer, not your own strength</li>
            <li>You boast in Christ alone, not in your achievements (Galatians 6:14)</li>
        </ul>
