    <div class="antithesis-box">
        <div class="old-way">
            <h3 style="color: #FF6347;">Old Teaching</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">"Love your neighbor<br/>and hate your enemy"</p>
            <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: var(--color-text-secondary);">(Leviticus 19:18 + human addition)</p>
        </div>
        <div class="arrow">→</div>

            <h3 style="color: #32CD32;">Jesus' Teaching</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">"Love your enemies<br/>and pray for persecutors"</p>
            <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: var(--color-text-secondary);">(Matthew 5:44)</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="glass-card">
        <h3 style="color: var(--color-primary);">What Was the "Old Teaching"?</h3>
        <p><strong>Leviticus 19:18</strong> - "Love your neighbor as yourself." This is God's command.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">But notice: The Old Testament <em>never</em> says "hate your enemy." This was a human inference:</p>
        <ul style="line-height: 2;">
            <li>If I must love my neighbor (fellow Israelite), then I can hate my enemy (Gentile, foreigner).</li>
            <li>The Dead Sea Scrolls (Qumran community) explicitly taught: "Love all the sons of light and hate all the sons of darkness."</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Jesus corrects this false inference. The Old Testament actually taught kindness to enemies:</p>
        <div class="cross-ref"><strong>Exodus 23:4-5</strong> - "If you come across your enemy's ox or donkey wandering off, be sure to return it. If you see the donkey of someone who hates you fallen down under its load, do not leave it there; be sure you help them with it."</div>
        <div class="cross-ref"><strong>Proverbs 25:21</strong> - "If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat; if he is thirsty, give him water to drink."</div>
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>💚 What Does "Love Your Enemies" Mean?</h2>
    <div class="glass-card">
        <h3 style="color: #32CD32;">Greek: ἀγαπᾶτε τοὺς ἐχθροὺς ὑμῶν (agapate tous echthrous hymōn)</h3>
        <ul style="line-height: 2;">
            <li><strong>ἀγαπάω (agapaō)</strong> - To love with deliberate, sacrificial, covenant love. Not romantic or emotional love, but willed goodwill.</li>
            <li><strong>ἐχθρός (echthros)</strong> - Enemy, hostile one, adversary. Those who oppose you, hate you, persecute you.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="color: var(--color-primary); margin-top: 2rem;">What This Love Looks Like</h3>
        <ol style="line-height: 2;">
            <li><strong>Pray for those who persecute you</strong> (v. 44) - Intercede for your enemies' good</li>
            <li><strong>Seek their welfare</strong> - Actively do good to those who harm you</li>
            <li><strong>Refuse vengeance</strong> - Don't retaliate or seek revenge (Romans 12:19)</li>
            <li><strong>Bless, don't curse</strong> - Speak well of them, not evil (Romans 12:14)</li>
        </ol>

        <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem; background: rgba(50, 205, 50, 0.1); padding: 1rem; border-radius: var(--radius-sm);"><strong>Important:</strong> Loving enemies doesn't mean approving their evil or enabling injustice. Love can include confronting sin, seeking justice, and protecting the innocent. But it always seeks the enemy's ultimate good, not their destruction.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>☀️ The Reason: Imitating God (v. 45)</h2>
    <div class="glass-card">
        <div class="verse-card">
            "That you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous." (Matthew 5:45)
        </div>

        <h3 style="color: var(--color-primary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">God's Indiscriminate Goodness</h3>
        <p>Why should we love enemies? Because <strong>God does</strong>. God shows common grace to all people - both righteous and wicked:</p>
        <ul style="line-height: 2;">
            <li><strong>Sun rises</strong> on both evil and good - God's provision of light and warmth</li>
            <li><strong>Rain falls</strong> on both righteous and unrighteous - God's provision of water for crops</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">God doesn't withhold basic blessings from his enemies. He is patient, kind, and generous even to those who rebel against him. If we are his children, we should imitate his character.</p>

        <div class="cross-ref"><strong>Luke 6:35</strong> - "Love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked."</div>
        <div class="cross-ref"><strong>Romans 5:8</strong> - "But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us."</div>
    </div>

    <h2>🤔 The Challenge: What's So Special About That? (vv. 46-47)</h2>
    <div class="glass-card">
        <p>Jesus raises the bar with two rhetorical questions:</p>

        <h3 style="color: var(--color-primary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">1. "If you love those who love you, what reward will you get?" (v. 46)</h3>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> None. Even tax collectors (notorious sinners) love those who love them back. There's nothing distinctive, nothing kingdom-like, about reciprocal love.</p>

        <h3 style="color: var(--color-primary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">2. "If you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others?" (v. 47)</h3>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Nothing. Even pagans (Gentiles) greet their friends and family. Selective kindness is universal human behavior.</p>

        <h3 style="color: var(--color-primary); margin-top: 2rem;">The Point</h3>
        <p style="background: rgba(50, 205, 50, 0.1); padding: 1rem; border-radius: var(--radius-sm);">Kingdom citizens are called to a <strong>higher standard</strong> - a love that transcends natural human boundaries. Loving enemies is the mark of God's children, because God himself loves his enemies.</p>
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>🌟 "Be Perfect, Therefore, As Your Heavenly Father Is Perfect" (v. 48)</h2>
    <div class="glass-card">
        <h3 style="color: gold;">Greek: τέλειοι (teleioi) - Perfect, Complete, Mature</h3>
        <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Not sinless perfection (which is impossible), but <em>completeness</em> in love - an all-encompassing, impartial love that includes even enemies.</p>

        <h3 style="color: var(--color-primary); margin-top: 2rem;">God's Perfection = Complete, Impartial Love</h3>
        <p>God's perfection is seen in his complete, indiscriminate love. He doesn't just love those who love him; he loves his enemies. <strong>Be like God in this</strong> - let your love be complete, reaching even to enemies.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Luke's parallel says: <strong>"Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful"</strong> (Luke 6:36). The parallel shows that "perfection" here means <em>perfect love, perfect mercy</em> - the kind God shows.</p>

        <div class="cross-ref"><strong>Leviticus 19:2</strong> - "Be holy because I, the LORD your God, am holy."</div>
        <div class="cross-ref"><strong>1 John 4:7-8</strong> - "Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love."</div>
    </div>

    <h2>✝️ How Jesus Embodied This Teaching</h2>
    <div class="glass-card" style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(50, 205, 50, 0.1), rgba(var(--color-primary-rgb), 0.1));">
        <p>Jesus is the supreme example of enemy love:</p>

        <div class="cross-ref">
            <strong>Luke 23:34</strong> - "Jesus said, 'Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.'" (Praying for his executioners on the cross)
        </div>

        <div class="cross-ref">
            <strong>1 Peter 2:23</strong> - "When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly."
        </div>

        <div class="cross-ref">
            <strong>Romans 5:8, 10</strong> - "But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us... For if, while we were God's enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son..."
        </div>

        <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem; font-style: italic;">Jesus loved his enemies to the point of dying for them. We were God's enemies, rebels against his rule, yet Christ died to reconcile us. Enemy love is the heart of the gospel.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>🛠️ Practical Application</h2>
    <div class="glass-card">
        <h3 style="color: var(--color-primary);">How Do We Love Enemies?</h3>
        <ol style="line-height: 2;">
            <li><strong>Identify your enemies</strong> - Who opposes you? Who has wronged you? Who persecutes you?</li>
            <li><strong>Pray for them by name</strong> - Ask God to bless them, save them, prosper them (Matthew 5:44)</li>
            <li><strong>Seek opportunities to do good</strong> - Actively look for ways to serve and help them (Romans 12:20)</li>
            <li><strong>Refuse to retaliate</strong> - Break the cycle of vengeance; leave justice to God (Romans 12:19)</li>
            <li><strong>Speak well of them</strong> - Bless, don't curse; honor, don't slander (1 Peter 3:9)</li>
            <li><strong>Remember you were once God's enemy</strong> - Your love is a reflection of the love shown to you (Ephesians 4:32)</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 style="color: var(--color-primary); margin-top: 2rem;">Hard Cases</h3>
        <ul style="line-height: 2;">
            <li><strong>Abuse victims:</strong> Loving enemies doesn't mean staying in an abusive situation. Seek safety, set boundaries, pursue justice - while still praying for the abuser's repentance.</li>
            <li><strong>National enemies:</strong> Christians can support just defense while still praying for and seeking the good of enemy nations.</li>
            <li><strong>Persistent evil:</strong> Love doesn't mean tolerating evil or enabling sin. Confront wickedness while seeking the evildoer's ultimate good (repentance, salvation).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
