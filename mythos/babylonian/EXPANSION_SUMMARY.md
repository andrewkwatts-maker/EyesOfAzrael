### Links That Need Target Pages Created
The following links exist in current pages but point to non-existent files:

**From `deities/index.html`:**
- Needs: `anu.html`, `enlil.html`, `ereshkigal.html`, `nergal.html`, `shamash.html`, `sin.html`, `tammuz.html`, `tiamat.html`, `apsu.html`

**From individual deity pages (marduk.html, ishtar.html, nabu.html, ea.html):**
- Needs: `../creatures/tiamat.html`
- Needs: `../creatures/bull-of-heaven.html`
- Needs: `../heroes/gilgamesh.html`

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR COMPLETION

### PRIORITY 1: Complete Deity Pages (9 remaining)
**Effort:** 3-4 hours

9. **Apsû** - Primordial waters, creation myth

Each should follow the template established by `ea.html`:

   - **Stage 5: Ummânu** (15-20 years) - Scholar-sage, teaching others

     - Requirements and training
     - Responsibilities and powers
     - Rituals and texts mastered
     - Social status and role
     - Path to next stage

### PRIORITY 3: Individual Detail Pages

Create focused pages for specific topics:

- Individual text pages (Epic of Gilgamesh analysis, Erra Epic, etc.)

### PRIORITY 4: Cross-Tradition Integration
**Effort:** Ongoing as other traditions are built
**Impact:** HIGH for overall project cohesion

- Currently, Babylonian pages link to other traditions (Sumerian, Greek, Egyptian, etc.)
- These links should be reciprocated when those traditions are built
- The `ARCHETYPE_MAPPINGS.md` file provides excellent foundation for cross-tradition comparisons
- When building other traditions, reference back to Babylonian content

## COMPARISON WITH OTHER TRADITIONS (Future Work)

The Babylonian content provides templates for:

- **Assyrian:** Similar pantheon with Ashur as supreme god
- **Persian/Zoroastrian:** Inherited cosmic dualism concepts
- **Greek:** Parallel pantheon structure, different emphasis
- **Egyptian:** Similar cosmic waters, different creation method
- **Jewish:** Strong influence on early biblical narratives
- **Hindu:** Comparable complexity, different cosmology
