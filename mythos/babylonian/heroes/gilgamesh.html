<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a> is the protagonist of the Epic of <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a>, one of the earliest known works of literary fiction
and the oldest surviving great work of literature. As king of Uruk, he was renowned for his strength, beauty, and
wisdom, but also for his tyranny. His journey from arrogant king to wise ruler, prompted by friendship, loss, and the
quest for immortality, explores fundamental questions about human mortality, friendship, legacy, and the meaning of life.
</p>

<h2>Birth and Divine Heritage</h2>
<h3>Royal and Divine Lineage</h3>
<p>
<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a> was born of the goddess Ninsun (the Wild Cow) and the mortal king Lugalbanda, making him two-thirds divine
and one-third mortal. This unique heritage gave him superhuman strength, beauty, and wisdom, but also condemned him to
mortality—the source of his great existential struggle. His divine blood made him superior to ordinary men, yet his
human portion meant he would still face death.
</p>

<h3>King of Uruk</h3>
<p>
As the fifth king of the First Dynasty of Uruk, <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a> ruled around 2700 BCE. Historical king lists mention him,
suggesting he may have been a real ruler whose exploits were later mythologized. His greatest architectural achievement
was building the massive walls of Uruk, which the epic presents as a lasting monument to his greatness.
</p>

<h2>The Tyrant King</h2>
<h3>Oppression of Uruk</h3>
<p>
At the beginning of his story, <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a> is portrayed as a powerful but oppressive ruler. His people cry out
to the gods because:
</p>
<ul>
<li>He claims the right to sleep with every new bride on her wedding night (droit du seigneur)</li>
<li>He forces the young men of Uruk into endless labor building the city walls</li>
<li>His strength and arrogance make him insufferable</li>
<li>"There is no rival who can raise a weapon against him"</li>
</ul>
<p>
The gods hear the people's complaints and decide to create a rival for <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a>—someone who can match his
strength and channel his boundless energy.
</p>

<h2>Enkidu: The Wild Man</h2>
<h3>Creation of Enkidu</h3>
<p>
The gods instruct Aruru, goddess of creation, to form Enkidu from clay. He is created as <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a>'s equal:
strong, beautiful, but completely wild—living with animals, eating grass, drinking from streams. He represents nature,
innocence, and the untamed world beyond civilization.
</p>

<h3>The Taming of Enkidu</h3>
<p>
When hunters report this wild man who frees animals from their traps, <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a> sends Shamhat, a temple
priestess, to civilize Enkidu through seduction. After seven days and nights with Shamhat, Enkidu is transformed:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The animals flee from him—he can no longer return to the wild</li>
<li>He gains human consciousness and language</li>
<li>He learns to eat bread, drink beer, wear clothes</li>
<li>He becomes civilized but loses his innocence</li>
</ul>
<p>
This transformation symbolizes humanity's transition from nature to culture, innocence to knowledge.
</p>

<h3>The Friendship</h3>
<p>
Enkidu travels to Uruk intending to stop <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a> from claiming a bride. The two engage in a tremendous
wrestling match, evenly matched in strength. <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a> eventually prevails, but he is so impressed by Enkidu's
valor that instead of destroying him, he embraces him as a brother. They become inseparable companions—the first great
literary friendship. Enkidu's presence transforms <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a> from a selfish tyrant into a more balanced and noble ruler.
</p>

<h2>The Adventures</h2>
<h3>Journey to the Cedar Forest</h3>
<p>
Seeking glory and to make a name that will endure, <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a> proposes an expedition to the Cedar Forest (possibly
Lebanon) to cut down sacred cedars and slay Humbaba (or Huwawa), the monstrous guardian appointed by <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Enlil" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/enlil.html" title="Search corpus for 'Enlil'">Enlil</a>. Enkidu
initially resists, knowing Humbaba's terrible power, but loyalty to his friend compels him to go.
</p>

<h3>Defeat of Humbaba</h3>
<p>
After a long journey, the heroes confront Humbaba, whose voice is a flood, whose mouth is fire, and whose breath is death.
In the battle, the sun god <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Shamash" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/shamash.html" title="Search corpus for 'Shamash'">Shamash</a> aids the heroes by sending thirteen winds to blind Humbaba. Defeated, the
monster begs for mercy, but Enkidu urges <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a> to kill him, which they do. They cut down the sacred cedars
and fashion a great door from the finest tree. This act of hubris—killing a divine guardian and desecrating a sacred
forest—will have terrible consequences.
</p>

<h3>The Bull of Heaven</h3>
<p>
Upon their return to Uruk, the goddess <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Ishtar" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/ishtar.html" title="Search corpus for 'Ishtar'">Ishtar</a> (Inanna) propositions <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a>, offering him marriage and
divine gifts. <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a> refuses insultingly, recounting how <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Ishtar" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/ishtar.html" title="Search corpus for 'Ishtar'">Ishtar</a> destroyed all her previous lovers (including
Tammuz/Dumuzi). Enraged by this rejection, <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Ishtar" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/ishtar.html" title="Search corpus for 'Ishtar'">Ishtar</a> persuades her father Anu to release the Bull of Heaven to
punish Uruk.
</p>
<p>
The Bull of Heaven descends and devastates Uruk with its snorting—each breath kills hundreds. <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a> and Enkidu
fight the divine bull together and slay it. In final insult, Enkidu tears off the bull's thigh and throws it in <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Ishtar" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/ishtar.html" title="Search corpus for 'Ishtar'">Ishtar</a>'s
face. This act of supreme hubris seals their doom.
</p>

<h2>The Death of Enkidu</h2>
<h3>Divine Judgment</h3>
<p>
The gods convene to judge <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a> and Enkidu for their crimes: killing Humbaba (a divine guardian)
and the Bull of Heaven (a sacred creature). The gods decree that one of them must die. Shamash pleads for both, but
<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Enlil" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/enlil.html" title="Search corpus for 'Enlil'">Enlil</a> insists. Enkidu is chosen, perhaps because he is fully created by the gods and therefore more subject to their
will.
</p>

<h3>Enkidu's Dreams and Death</h3>
<p>
Enkidu falls ill and experiences terrible dreams of the underworld—a place of darkness where the dead eat dust and clay,
clothed in feathers like birds. He curses Shamhat for civilizing him (bringing him to this fate) and curses the hunter.
Shamash reminds him that civilization also brought friendship with <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a>, so Enkidu blesses them instead. After
twelve days of suffering, Enkidu dies in <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a>'s arms.
</p>

<h3>Gilgamesh's Grief</h3>
<p>
<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a>'s grief is profound and transformative. He refuses to believe Enkidu is dead, waiting until a maggot falls
from his friend's nose before accepting reality. He orders magnificent funeral rites, gives treasure to the underworld
gods, and wanders the wilderness in mourning. For the first time, the demigod king confronts his own mortality. If
Enkidu—strong, noble Enkidu—could die, then so can <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a>. This unbearable thought drives him on his greatest
journey.
</p>

<h2>The Quest for Immortality</h2>
<h3>Journey to Utnapishtim</h3>
<p>
<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a> learns of Utnapishtim (the Babylonian Noah), the only mortal granted immortality by the gods after surviving
the Great Flood. Determined to learn the secret of eternal life, <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a> undertakes a perilous journey to the
ends of the earth where Utnapishtim dwells.
</p>

<h3>The Mountain of Mashu</h3>
<p>
<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a> reaches the twin peaks of Mount Mashu, which hold up the sky and guard the gates through which the sun
passes. The scorpion-people who guard the gate are terrified by his appearance but, recognizing his partly divine nature,
allow him to pass through the twelve leagues of absolute darkness of the sun's path through the mountain.
</p>

<h3>The Garden of the Gods</h3>
<p>
Emerging from darkness, <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a> enters a marvelous garden where trees bear jewels as fruit—carnelian,
lapis lazuli, pearls. There he meets Siduri, the divine wine-maker, who advises him to abandon his quest and enjoy life's
simple pleasures. She tells him:
</p>
<div class="golden-box">
<p><em>"Gilgamesh, where are you hurrying to? You will never find that life for which you are looking. When the gods created
man they allotted to him death, but life they retained in their own keeping. As for you, Gilgamesh, fill your belly with
good things; day and night, night and day, dance and be merry, feast and rejoice. Let your clothes be fresh, bathe yourself
in water, cherish the little child that holds your hand, and make your wife happy in your embrace; for this too is the
lot of man."</em></p>
</div>
<p>
But <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a>, driven by grief and fear, refuses to accept mortality and presses on.
</p>

<h3>Meeting with Utnapishtim</h3>
<p>
<a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a> crosses the Waters of Death with the ferryman Urshanabi and finally reaches Utnapishtim. The immortal
flood-hero tells <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a> that immortality was granted to him under unique, unrepeatable circumstances—as reward
for preserving life during the Flood. Death is the natural lot of humanity, decreed by the gods. There is no escaping it.
</p>

<h3>The Test of Sleep</h3>
<p>
To prove the futility of seeking immortality, Utnapishtim challenges <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a> to stay awake for six days and
seven nights—if he cannot even conquer sleep (death's cousin), how can he hope to conquer death? <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a> immediately
falls asleep for seven days. When awakened, he is devastated by this proof of his human weakness.
</p>

<h2>The Plant of Rejuvenation</h2>
<h3>The Gift and Its Loss</h3>
<p>
Taking pity on <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a>, Utnapishtim's wife persuades her husband to reveal a secret: at the bottom of the
cosmic ocean grows a plant that restores youth. <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a> dives deep, finds the plant, and begins the journey home,
planning to share it with the elders of Uruk to restore their youth and then use it himself.
</p>
<p>
But while bathing in a pool, a serpent steals the plant and immediately sheds its skin, becoming young again. <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a>
weeps bitterly, realizing he has labored for nothing. This episode explains why serpents shed their skin (gaining
perpetual renewal) while humans cannot.
</p>

<h2>Return to Uruk and Acceptance</h2>
<h3>The Transformation</h3>
<p>
Returning to Uruk empty-handed, <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a> has been transformed by his journey. He no longer rages against mortality
but instead points with pride to the great walls of Uruk—his lasting legacy. The epic ends as it began, with the narrator
inviting readers to walk on Uruk's walls and admire their construction. <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a> has learned that immortality comes
not through escaping death, but through great deeds, enduring works, and the memory of those who come after.
</p>

<h3>Wisdom Gained</h3>
<p>
The tyrant who began the epic obsessed with his own glory ends as a wise king who has learned:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The value of friendship and love</li>
<li>The inevitability of death</li>
<li>The importance of legacy through works and memory</li>
<li>To cherish life's simple joys rather than chase impossible dreams</li>
<li>That accepting human limitations is the path to wisdom</li>
</ul>

<h2>Literary and Historical Significance</h2>
<h3>The Epic Tradition</h3>
<p>
The Epic of <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a> exists in multiple versions (Sumerian, Old Babylonian, Standard Babylonian) spanning over
a thousand years. The Standard Babylonian version, compiled by the scribe Sin-leqi-unninni around 1200 BCE, is the most
complete. It profoundly influenced later literature, including possible connections to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The biblical flood narrative (Noah's Ark)</li>
<li>Greek epics (themes of friendship, heroic quests, mortality)</li>
<li>The friendship of Achilles and Patroclus in the Iliad</li>
<li>Odysseus's journey and quest for home</li>
</ul>

<h3>Modern Rediscovery</h3>
<p>
The epic was lost for over two thousand years until tablets were discovered in the ruins of Ashurbanipal's library at
Nineveh in the 1850s. The flood tablet was first translated in 1872, causing a sensation due to its parallels with the
biblical flood. <a class="corpus-link" data-term="Gilgamesh" data-tradition="babylonian" href="../../../corpus-results/babylonian/gilgamesh.html" title="Search corpus for 'Gilgamesh'">Gilgamesh</a> is now recognized as one of humanity's foundational literary works.
</p>
