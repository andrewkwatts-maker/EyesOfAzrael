            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-top: 1rem;">Ereshkigal is the absolute sovereign of Kur, the Land of No Return.

            <h2 style="color: var(--mythos-primary);">Mythology & Stories</h2>
            <p>Ereshkigal represents the absolute power of death. She is feared, not loved. Her realm accepts all who die, offering no paradise for the virtuous or punishment for the wicked—only gray, dusty existence. Her myths demonstrate that even divine power cannot escape mortality in her domain.</p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1.5rem;">Key Myths:</h3>
            <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 0 2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>The Descent of Inanna:</strong> When Inanna descended to Kur to attend the funeral of Gugalanna (Bull of Heaven), she passed through seven gates, losing a garment and divine power at each. Arriving naked and powerless, she stood before Ereshkigal's throne. The Anunnaki judges decreed her death. Ereshkigal struck her sister down with a word, hung her corpse on a hook, and let it rot for three days. Only Enki's intervention brought Inanna back to life. But the law of the underworld demanded a substitute—someone must take Inanna's place. When Inanna chose her consort Dumuzi, Ereshkigal's demons dragged him to Kur. This myth establishes Ereshkigal's absolute power—even the mighty Queen of Heaven must die in her realm.</li>
                <li><strong>Nergal and Ereshkigal:</strong> The god Nergal insulted Ereshkigal by refusing to stand for her messenger at a divine banquet. Furious, she demanded he come to Kur to face punishment. Nergal descended with fourteen demons. He overpowered Ereshkigal's guards and seized her by the hair, threatening to cut off her head. She wept and pleaded, offering to marry him and share her throne. Nergal accepted, becoming the first (and only) male consort to rule alongside her. This myth explains why the underworld has both a queen and a king, and demonstrates that even Ereshkigal can be overcome by force—though she turns defeat into partnership.</li>
                <li><strong>Gilgamesh and Enkidu:</strong> When Enkidu died and descended to Kur, his spirit described the terrible realm to Gilgamesh in dreams. Ereshkigal's domain was dust and darkness. The dead wore feathers like birds and ate clay. Even great heroes and kings served as menials in her palace. This vision drove Gilgamesh's desperate quest for immortality—he could not bear the thought of ending in Ereshkigal's joyless realm.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary);">Sacred Sites</h3>
            <p>Ereshkigal had no major temples for joyful worship—she was feared, not celebrated. However, shrines existed at gravesites and in connection with funerary rituals. Her power was acknowledged in death rites and offerings to the dead. Cemeteries and tombs were considered her domain on earth.</p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1rem;">Rituals</h3>
            <ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 2rem;">
                <li><strong>Funerary Rites:</strong> Proper burial ensured smooth passage to Kur and Ereshkigal's acceptance of the soul</li>
                <li><strong>Offerings to the Dead:</strong> Food, water, and beer poured into graves reached the dead in Ereshkigal's realm</li>
                <li><strong>Protection Rituals:</strong> Amulets and incantations to prevent Ereshkigal's demons from claiming living souls prematurely</li>
                <li><strong>Appeasement:</strong> Not celebration but fear-based respect to avoid her wrath</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 style="color: var(--mythos-secondary); margin-top: 1rem;">Prayers & Invocations</h3>
            <p>Prayers to Ereshkigal were pragmatic—requests for delayed death, proper treatment of deceased loved ones, and protection from demons. "Ereshkigal, great queen of Kur, let this soul find rest in your dark city. Accept these offerings and grant mercy to one who walks in your realm." Exorcists invoked her name to command demons. Mourners prayed for the dead to be received well in her kingdom.</p>
