    "description": "The Babylonian underworld was a dark, dreary realm beneath the earth where all the dead dwelled\n                regardless of their deeds in life.

Here the dead existed as\n                shadowy echoes, stripped of vitality, clothed in feathers like birds, eating dust and clay.",
