This cloak belonged\n                    to the dwarf-king Alberich, who guarded the treasure of the Nibelungs.\n                \n                \n                    The hero Siegfried defeated Alberich and took both his treasure and the Tarnkappe. In\n                    addition to granting invisibility, some versions of the legend ascribe the cloak with the\n                    power to grant the strength of twelve men to its wearer, making it both a tool of stealth\n                    and enhancement.\n                \n                \n                    Siegfried used the Tarnkappe to help King Gunther defeat the warrior queen Brunhild in\n                    contests of strength, invisibly assisting Gunther in feats he could not have accomplished\n                    alone. This use of the cloak for deception led ultimately to tragic consequences."

It\n                    rendered its wearer completely invisible, allowing Hades to move unseen even among gods.\n                \n                \n                    The cap was lent to the hero Perseus for his quest to slay Medusa. Using the cap along with\n                    Hermes's winged sandals and a magical kibisis (bag), Perseus was able to approach Medusa\n                    unseen and escape her sisters after cutting off her head.\n                \n                \n                    Athena also borrowed the cap during the Trojan War to conceal herself from Ares, demonstrating\n                    that even Olympians required such tools to hide from one another."
