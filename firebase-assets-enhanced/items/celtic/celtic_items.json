According to the Lebor Gabala Erenn (Book of Invasions), each of the Four Treasures came\n                    from one of these cities:\n                \n                \n                    From Falias: The Lia Fail (Stone of Destiny)\n                    From Gorias: The Spear of Lugh\n                    From Findias: The Sword of Nuada (Claiomh Solais)\n                    From Murias: The Cauldron of the Dagda\n                \n\n                Nuada and the Sword\n                \n                    Nuada Airgetlam (\"Nuada of the Silver Hand/Arm\") was the first king of the Tuatha De Danann\n                    in Ireland. He carried the Claiomh Solais in the First Battle of Mag Tuired against the Fir\n                    Bolg, where its brilliant light turned the tide of combat. However, during this battle, Nuada\n                    lost his right hand to the Fir Bolg champion Sreng.\n                \n                \n                    Under Celtic law, a king could not rule if he possessed any physical blemish. Nuada was forced\n                    to give up the kingship, passing it to Bres, who proved to be a tyrannical ruler. Eventually,\n                    the divine physician Dian Cecht crafted Nuada a fully functional silver hand, restoring his\n                    ability to rule. Later, Dian Cecht's son Miach replaced this with a hand of flesh.\n                \n                \n                    With his hand restored, Nuada reclaimed his throne and his sword. He wielded the Claiomh Solais\n                    again in the Second Battle of Mag Tuired against the Fomorians, though he ultimately fell in\n                    battle against the Fomorian king Balor of the Evil Eye.\n                \n\n                Folklore Traditions\n                \n                    Beyond the mythological cycle, the Sword of Light appears in numerous Irish and Scottish\n                    folktales, often as a quest object that a hero must obtain to defeat evil. In these stories,\n                    the sword is typically guarded by supernatural beings or hidden in inaccessible locations,\n                    requiring cunning, courage, and moral worthiness to obtain."

The smith who created it was said to have captured the essence of the winds in\n                    the blade, giving it power over the element of air itself. The metal was quenched in sacred\n                    waters and blessed with enchantments that would never fade.\n                \n                \n                    Manannan mac Lir, as lord of the Otherworld and guardian of the passages between realms,\n                    became the sword's first wielder among the gods. He used Fragarach to defend the borders\n                    between the mortal world and the realms beyond, ensuring that neither the living nor the\n                    dead could pass without proper authority.\n                \n\n                Transfer to Lugh\n                \n                    When Lugh Lamhfada - the young god who mastered every art and craft - came to take his place\n                    among the Tuatha De Danann, Manannan bestowed upon him several gifts essential for the coming\n                    battle against the Fomorians. Among these was Fragarach, which Lugh would wield alongside\n                    his famous spear in the Second Battle of Mag Tuired.\n                \n                \n                    In that great conflict, Lugh used Fragarach to devastating effect against the Fomorian\n                    champions. The sword's power to cut through any armor negated the magical protections that\n                    many Fomorian warriors relied upon, while its truth-compelling properties helped Lugh\n                    identify traitors and ensure the loyalty of his forces.\n                \n\n                Legacy Through the Ages\n                \n                    After the age of the Tuatha De Danann, Fragarach passed through various hands. Some\n                    traditions claim it was eventually wielded by Conn of the Hundred Battles, the legendary\n                    High King of Ireland, and later by his descendants. The sword became associated with\n                    legitimate kingship - only a true ruler, chosen by the gods, could wield Fragarach\n                    without being harmed by its power."

He was the master of every skill and craft - warrior, king,\n                    poet, harper, smith, sorcerer, and more. When Lugh arrived at the court of King Nuada to\n                    join the Tuatha De Danann, he demonstrated mastery of every art, earning him the title\n                    \"Samildanach\" (Equally Skilled in All Arts).\n                \n                \n                    Fragarach complemented Lugh's other weapons - his famous spear Gae Assail and his sling\n                    with which he slew Balor of the Evil Eye. Together, these weapons made Lugh virtually\n                    invincible and enabled him to lead the Tuatha De Danann to victory in their greatest battles."

Every High King of Ireland was inaugurated on\n                    this stone. The stone's cry confirmed divine favor and the land's acceptance of its\n                    new ruler, essential components of Celtic sacral kingship.\n                \n                \n                    Legend states that the hero Cu Chulainn struck the stone in anger when it failed to\n                    cry out for him (he was not meant to be king), and from that day it never spoke again\n                    except for two occasions: under Conn of the Hundred Battles and under his grandson\n                    Cormac mac Airt.\n                \n\n                Scottish Connection\n                \n                    According to Scottish tradition, the Stone of Destiny was taken to Scotland in ancient\n                    times and became the Stone of Scone, used for the coronation of Scottish kings at Scone\n                    Abbey. Whether this is the same stone or a different coronation stone is debated.\n                \n                \n                    In 1296, King Edward I of England seized the Stone of Scone and took it to Westminster\n                    Abbey, where it was incorporated into the coronation chair. English and later British\n                    monarchs were crowned over it for seven centuries until it was returned to Scotland in 1996."
