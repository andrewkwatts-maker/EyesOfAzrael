Its creation from adamantine,\n                    its ability to harm immortals, and its role in cosmic succession all became recurring\n                    themes in Greek mythological weaponry."

But Uranus hated his\n                    children and feared their power. He imprisoned them within Gaia's body -\n                    within the earth itself - causing the Earth Mother tremendous pain.\n                \n                \n                    Unable to bear her suffering any longer, Gaia fashioned the adamantine sickle\n                    and called upon her Titan children to rise against their father. Only Cronus,\n                    the youngest and most cunning of the Titans, agreed to the terrible task.\n                \n\n                The Ambush\n                \n                    Gaia positioned Cronus in hiding and gave him the sickle. When Uranus descended\n                    to couple with Gaia, spreading himself across the earth, Cronus struck. With the\n                    adamantine blade, he severed his father's genitals and cast them into the sea.\n                \n                \n                    From this act of cosmic violence came unexpected creation. The blood that fell\n                    upon the earth spawned the Erinyes (Furies), the Giants, and the Meliae (ash-tree\n                    nymphs). The severed genitals, falling into the sea, produced foam from which\n                    Aphrodite, goddess of love and beauty, was born."
