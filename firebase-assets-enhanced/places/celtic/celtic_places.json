For over 5,000 years, this conical quartzite\n                mountain has been a place of pilgrimage - first for pre-Christian Celtic peoples who honored the\n                harvest god Crom Dubh, and then for Christians following in the footsteps of St. Patrick. According\n                to tradition, in 441 CE, Patrick fasted on the summit for forty days and forty nights, emulating\n                Moses and Christ, and it was here that he banished all snakes from Ireland. Today, over 100,000\n                pilgrims climb \"the Reek\" annually, many barefoot, making it one of the most important Christian\n                pilgrimage sites in Europe.",

Today identified with the Forest of\n                Paimpont in central Brittany, this ancient woodland has been associated with the Arthurian\n                legends since at least the 12th century, when poets like Chretien de Troyes and the anonymous\n                authors of the Vulgate Cycle set their magical tales within its bounds. The forest remains a\n                place of pilgrimage for those seeking the living memory of Camelot and the old Celtic magic\n                that predates the medieval romances.",
