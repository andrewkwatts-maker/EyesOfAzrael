  "description": "Hanuman stands as one of the most revered and multifaceted figures in Hindu mythology. Revered as the deity of Anjaneya (Son of Anjana), Maruti (Son of Maruta/Vayu), Bajrangbali (One with Limbs Strong as Vajra/Thunderbolt), Hanuman embodies the fundamental forces that shape both the divine and mortal realms. \n\nAccording to Hindu sacred texts, Hanuman's origins represent eternal aspects of Brahman, cycling through cosmic ages and divine incarnations The worship of Hanuman became central to Hindu religious practice, with devotees seeking their favor through puja ceremonies, bhakti devotion, and sacred pilgrimages. \n\nSacred symbols associated with Hanuman include Mace (gada), Mountain (carried to Lanka), Rama's image on his chest (eternal devotion). These emblems appear throughout Hindu art and literature, serving as powerful reminders of Hanuman's divine presence and authority. The mythology surrounding Hanuman reveals deep insights into Hindu worldview, particularly concerning Anjaneya (Son of Anjana) and humanity's relationship with the divine. \n\nThe legacy of Hanuman extends far beyond ancient Hindu civilization. Hanuman continues to receive active worship by millions of devotees. The deity's philosophy and practices have influenced yoga, meditation, and spiritual movements globally Scholars continue to study Hanuman's mythology for its profound insights into Hindu culture, religion, and philosophy.",
