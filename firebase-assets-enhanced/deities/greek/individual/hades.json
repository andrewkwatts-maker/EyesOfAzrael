  "description": "Hades stands as one of the most iconic and influential figures in Greek mythology. Revered as the deity of Lord of the Dead, The Unseen One, Pluto (The Wealthy), Hades embodies the fundamental forces that shape both the divine and mortal realms. \n\nAccording to Greek sacred texts, Hades's origins trace back to the primordial age, emerging from the cosmic struggle between Titans and Olympians The worship of Hades became central to Greek religious practice, with devotees seeking their favor through temple sacrifices, libations, and participation in sacred festivals. \n\nSacred symbols associated with Hades include Helm of darkness, bident, Cerberus. These emblems appear throughout Greek art and literature, serving as powerful reminders of Hades's divine presence and authority. The mythology surrounding Hades reveals deep insights into Greek worldview, particularly concerning Lord of the Dead and humanity's relationship with the divine. \n\nThe legacy of Hades extends far beyond ancient Greek civilization. References to Hades pervade Western literature, from Renaissance poetry to modern novels. The archetype continues to influence psychology, philosophy, and popular culture Scholars continue to study Hades's mythology for its profound insights into Greek culture, religion, and philosophy.",
  "role": "Lord of the Underworld , God of the Dead",
  "worship": {
    "sacred_sites": "Hades had few temples as Greeks feared to invoke his name. Most worship occurred at necropolises (cities of the dead) or at sites associated with entrances to the underworld , such as caves and deep chasms. The oracle at Epirus consulted the dead through rituals to Hades .",
    "offerings": "Black animals (sheep, cattle) were sacrificed with their blood poured into the earth. Unlike offerings to Olympian gods, sacrifices to Hades were completely burned or buried rather than shared in feasts. Libations of water, wine, milk, and honey were poured for the dead. Worshippers would avert their faces during Hades ' rituals.",
    "prayers": "Greeks rarely spoke Hades ' name, using epithets like \" Pluto \" (The Wealthy One) to avoid attracting his attention. Prayers typically sought to keep him at bay or to ensure safe passage for the deceased. The dead themselves were invoked through Hades in necromantic rituals."
