      "title": "Time Devouring All",
      "summary": "Cronos's consumption of his children represents time's inevitable destruction of all things. Just as time cannot stop its forward movement, Cronos could not resist his destiny. The image of the god eating his offspring became a powerful allegory: time consumes everything it creates, the present devours the future, and no achievement can escape eventual oblivion."

      "title": "Generational Conflict",
      "summary": "The pattern of sons overthrowing fathers - Cronos castrating Uranus, Zeus deposing Cronos - reflects the eternal conflict between generations. Each generation must supplant the previous one, yet fears being supplanted in turn. This cycle of revolution and resistance appears throughout mythology and mirrors the human experience of aging and succession."

    {
      "title": "Fear of Change",
      "summary": "Cronos's attempts to prevent the prophecy by swallowing his children represent resistance to change and fear of the future. His actions, meant to preserve his power, actually ensured the prophecy's fulfillment - a classic example of self-fulfilling prophecy. By trying to stop time, Cronos was destroyed by it."

      "title": "The Golden Age",
      "summary": "Cronos's reign as a golden age of perfection represents nostalgia for an idealized past. This myth acknowledges humanity's tendency to romanticize earlier eras while recognizing that such perfection cannot last. The golden age must give way to the current age, just as childhood innocence yields to adult complexity."
