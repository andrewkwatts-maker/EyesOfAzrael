        "body": "Sacred texts are more than books—they are repositories of divine revelation, cultural memory, and spiritual wisdom. They include creation accounts explaining cosmic origins, epic narratives preserving heroic legends, law codes establishing moral order, wisdom literature teaching right living, prophetic visions revealing the future, and ritual manuals guiding worship.\n\nSome texts claim direct divine authorship: the Torah given to Moses, the Quran revealed to Muhammad, the Vedas heard by ancient rishis. Others are human compositions elevated to sacred status through community use and reverence. Many combine divine inspiration with human artistry, creating works that speak across millennia.\n\nOur collection includes 95 texts across 16 traditions: the Epic of Gilgamesh (oldest known epic), the Rigveda (ancient Vedic hymns), Homer's epics (foundational to Western literature), the Torah and Bible (Judeo-Christian scripture), the Quran (Islamic revelation), the Eddas (Norse mythology), the Popol Vuh (Mayan creation), and many others. Each preserves irreplaceable wisdom about how different peoples understood the cosmos, divinity, and human purpose."

        "body": "Most sacred texts began as oral traditions, passed down through generations by memory and performance before being written. The Homeric epics were sung by bards for centuries before scribes recorded them. The Vedas were memorized with extraordinary precision by Brahmin priests. The Norse Eddas preserved oral mythology in medieval manuscripts.\n\nThis oral background shaped the texts. They contain formulaic repetitions aiding memorization, rhythmic patterns designed for recitation, and mnemonic devices preserving accuracy. When finally written, they often retained their oral character—meant to be read aloud, heard, and performed rather than silently studied.\n\nThe transition to writing transformed sacred traditions. Texts became fixed, authoritative, and analyzable. Interpretation shifted from communal performance to scholarly study. Yet many traditions maintain oral elements: Quranic recitation, Biblical liturgy, Vedic chanting, and Torah cantillation preserve the original oral dimension of sacred words."

        "type": "text",
        "body": "Sacred texts demand interpretation. They contain:\n\n**Literal Meaning**: The surface narrative or instruction. Adam and Eve in the garden, Gilgamesh seeking immortality, the Buddha's first sermon.\n\n**Allegorical Meaning**: Symbolic interpretations. The Garden of Eden as the soul, Gilgamesh's quest as spiritual seeking, the Buddha's journey as the path to enlightenment.\n\n**Moral Meaning**: Ethical lessons. Stories teach about obedience, courage, compassion, justice, and right action.\n\n**Mystical Meaning**: Esoteric wisdom accessible only to initiates. Kabbalistic interpretation of Torah, Sufi understanding of Quran, tantric reading of Hindu texts.\n\nDifferent traditions emphasize different levels. Jewish interpretation includes peshat (literal), remez (allegorical), derash (moral), and sod (mystical)—captured in the acronym PaRDeS (Paradise). Christian interpretation developed similar fourfold methods. This multilayered approach acknowledges that sacred texts contain inexhaustible meaning, speaking differently to different readers across time."
