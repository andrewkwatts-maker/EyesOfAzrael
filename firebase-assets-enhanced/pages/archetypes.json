        "body": "Swiss psychologist Carl Jung proposed that beneath the surface diversity of world mythologies lie universal patterns—archetypes—that emerge from the collective unconscious of humanity. Whether we examine Greek Zeus, Norse Odin, Hindu Indra, or Yoruba Shango, we find the same essential pattern: the Sky Father, wielder of thunder, king of gods.\n\nThese archetypes are not mere coincidences. They reflect universal human experiences: birth and death, creation and destruction, love and loss, the cycle of seasons, the mystery of consciousness. By studying archetypes, we discover what makes us fundamentally human, seeing past cultural specifics to recognize our shared spiritual and psychological journey.\n\nOur archetype system maps 68 universal patterns across deity types, story structures, sacred places, journey motifs, prophecy patterns, and elemental forces. Each archetype entry explores its psychological meaning, cultural expressions, and connections across traditions."

They represent rebirth, divine judgment, and cosmic cleansing.\n\n**Dying and Rising Gods**: Deities who die and return to life—Osiris, Dionysus, Persephone, Dumuzi, Baldr—symbolize seasonal cycles, agricultural renewal, and hope for resurrection.\n\n**Divine Combat**: The storm god battles chaos (Marduk vs. Tiamat, Zeus vs. Typhon, Indra vs. Vritra), establishing cosmic order from primordial chaos.\n\n**Hero's Journey**: The monomyth where a hero is called to adventure, faces trials, dies symbolically, and returns transformed with gifts for their community."

The Great Mother archetype reflects every human's experience of maternal care and dependence. The Hero's Journey mirrors the psychological process of individuation and self-realization.\n\nArchetypes thus serve dual functions: They are mythological patterns found across cultures AND psychological structures within the individual psyche. When we study the Trickster in mythology, we also explore the trickster aspect of our own psychology—the part that breaks rules, crosses boundaries, and enables transformation through chaos.\n\nThis Jungian perspective doesn't reduce mythology to psychology. Rather, it suggests mythology and psychology address the same fundamental realities from different angles, using different languages to describe the same deep patterns of human existence."
