  "description": "Journey through the Buddhist cosmos of countless realms, bodhisattvas of compassion, and the path to nirvana.",
  "overview": "Buddhist mythology developed from the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama (the Buddha, c. 563-483 BCE) who achieved enlightenment and taught the path to liberation from suffering. While Buddhism began as a reform movement within Hinduism, it developed its own rich mythological cosmology including: the six realms of samsara, countless Buddha-worlds across infinite space and time, celestial bodhisattvas who delay their own enlightenment to help all beings, fierce dharma protectors, the elaborate Tibetan Book of the Dead, and the Mahayana ideal of the bodhisattva path. Buddhist mythology varies significantly between traditions - Theravada (focused on historical Buddha and arhats), Mahayana (emphasizing bodhisattvas and multiple Buddhas), and Vajrayana/Tibetan (incorporating tantric deities and practices). Core concepts include the Four Noble Truths, Eightfold Path, karma, dependent origination, emptiness (sunyata), and the ultimate goal of nirvana - the cessation of suffering through awakening.",

Reality transcends conceptual categories.\n\n**Two Truths:**\n- Conventional Truth (samvriti-satya): How things appear in relative reality\n- Ultimate Truth (paramartha-satya): The empty nature of all phenomena\n\nUnderstanding emptiness doesn't lead to nihilism but to compassion - seeing that all beings are interconnected and lack separate, independent selves."
