  "overview": "Babylonian mythology inherited and transformed earlier Sumerian and Akkadian traditions, creating a sophisticated theological system centered on Marduk's supremacy. The Enuma Elish describes Marduk defeating the primordial chaos goddess Tiamat and creating the world from her body. Babylonian religion emphasized divination, astrology, ritual magic, temple cult, and maintaining cosmic order. The tradition influenced Jewish, Christian, and Islamic mythologies through the Babylonian Exile period.",
