  "overview": "Aztec mythology centers on cyclical creation and destruction, with humanity currently living in the Fifth Sun era. The cosmos requires constant nourishment through ritual sacrifice to prevent cosmic collapse. Major deities include Huitzilopochtli (sun/war god and patron of Tenochtitlan), Quetzalcoatl (Feathered Serpent, wisdom and wind), Tezcatlipoca (Smoking Mirror, destiny and sorcery), and Tlaloc (rain and fertility). The tradition emphasizes: tonalli (life force), sacred warfare for captives, the Templo Mayor as cosmic mountain, calendar systems, and the Fifth Sun's inevitable destruction by earthquakes.",
