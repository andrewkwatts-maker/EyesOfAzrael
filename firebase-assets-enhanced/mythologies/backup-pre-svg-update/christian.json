  "overview": "Christian mythology centers on Jesus Christ as the incarnate Son of God who died for humanity's sins and rose from the dead, offering salvation and eternal life. The tradition encompasses: God as Trinity (Father, Son, Holy Spirit), creation and fall of humanity, covenant history with Israel, Christ's incarnation and resurrection, the Church as Christ's body, angelic hierarchies, Satan and fallen angels, the Second Coming and Last Judgment, and the New Heaven and New Earth. Christianity inherited Jewish scriptures (Old Testament) while adding new revelation (New Testament). Major branches include Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant traditions, each with distinct theological emphases and practices. The mythology incorporates mystical traditions (Gnosticism, Christian Kabbalah, hesychasm), saints and martyrs, apocalyptic literature, and sacramental theology.",
