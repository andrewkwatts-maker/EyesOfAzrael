  "description": "Journey through the Major Arcana's archetypal path from Fool to World, mapping spiritual initiation and inner transformation.",
  "overview": "Tarot mythology synthesizes Western esoteric traditions (Kabbalah, astrology, alchemy, Hermeticism) into 78 archetypal symbols. The 22 Major Arcana represent the Fool's Journey - a spiritual initiation from innocence through trials to enlightenment. Cards embody universal human experiences and psychological states. Tarot connects to: Kabbalistic Tree of Life (22 paths between 10 sefirot), astrological correspondences, four elements (suits), and Hero's Journey structure. Modern interpretation emphasizes psychological insight, synchronicity, and intuitive wisdom rather than fortune-telling.",
