  "overview": "Mayan mythology features sophisticated cosmology linking astronomy, mathematics, and theology. The Popol Vuh creation epic describes multiple failed humanities before maize people. The Hero Twins Hunahpu and Xbalanque defeated the lords of Xibalba (underworld) and became sun and moon. Mayan religion emphasized: complex calendar systems (Tzolk'in, Haab), bloodletting rituals for communication with gods, ballgames as cosmic drama, astronomy and mathematics, cyclical time, and world trees connecting realms. The tradition continues among living Maya communities.",
