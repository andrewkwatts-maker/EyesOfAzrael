  "overview": "Yoruba mythology from West Africa centers on Olodumare (supreme creator) who governs through Orisha - divine spirits embodying natural forces, human archetypes, and ancestral wisdom. Key Orisha include Eshu (trickster/messenger), Ogun (iron/war), Shango (thunder/kingship), Oshun (river/love), Yemoja (ocean/motherhood), and Obatala (creation/wisdom). The tradition emphasizes Ashe (divine power/life force), divination through Ifa, ancestor veneration, and maintaining balance between visible and spiritual worlds. Yoruba religion influenced diaspora traditions including Santeria, Candomble, and Vodou.",
