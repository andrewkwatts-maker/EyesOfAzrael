  "description": "Explore Persian Zoroastrian mythology of the eternal struggle between Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu, light and darkness.",
  "overview": "Persian mythology centers on Zoroastrianism, one of the world's oldest monotheistic religions. Ahura Mazda (Wise Lord) represents truth, light, and creation, opposed by Angra Mainyu (Destructive Spirit) representing lies, darkness, and chaos. Humans must choose between good and evil through thoughts, words, and deeds. The tradition emphasizes: fire as sacred symbol of truth, the Chinvat Bridge judgment after death, Amesha Spentas (Holy Immortals), and final renovation (Frashokereti) when evil is defeated and creation perfected. Zoroastrianism influenced Judaism, Christianity, and Islam with concepts of heaven/hell, angels/demons, messiah, and final judgment.",
