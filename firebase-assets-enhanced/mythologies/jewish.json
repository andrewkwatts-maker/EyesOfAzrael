  "overview": "Jewish mythology encompasses the covenantal relationship between the one God (YHWH/Adonai) and the Jewish people Israel. Core narratives include: Creation and Eden, the Patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac, Jacob), Exodus from Egypt, Sinai revelation of Torah, conquest of Canaan, Davidic kingdom, Babylonian Exile, return and Second Temple, destruction and diaspora. Jewish mysticism (Kabbalah) developed elaborate cosmology of sefirot (divine emanations), Ein Sof (infinite God), and tikkun olam (world repair). The tradition emphasizes: strict monotheism, chosen people status through covenant not superiority, Torah study and mitzvot (commandments), Sabbath observance, messiah expectation, and repair of the world.",
