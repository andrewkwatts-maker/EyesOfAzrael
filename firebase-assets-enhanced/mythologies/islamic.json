  "overview": "Islamic mythology centers on strict monotheism (Tawhid) - Allah as the one, indivisible God who revealed His will through prophets culminating in Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the Quran. The tradition includes: angelic hierarchies (Jibreel/Gabriel, Mikail/Michael), jinn (beings of smokeless fire with free will), prophetic narratives shared with Judaism and Christianity (Adam, Ibrahim, Musa, Isa), the Night Journey (Isra and Mi'raj) where Muhammad ascended through the seven heavens, Judgment Day, Paradise (Jannah), and Hell (Jahannam). Islamic cosmology emphasizes submission (islam) to Allah's will, following the Straight Path, and the ummah (community of believers).",
