  "overview": "Native American mythologies encompass hundreds of distinct tribal traditions across North and South America. Common themes include: trickster figures (Coyote, Raven, Spider), earth diver creation myths, Sky Woman and Turtle Island, spirit animals as guides and teachers, vision quests, sacred pipe ceremonies, and intimate relationship with land. Each nation has unique cosmology - Lakota seven sacred rites, Hopi emergence myth, Navajo Holy People, Iroquois Great Peacemaker. The traditions emphasize balance, respect for all relations (mitakuye oyasin), oral transmission, and continuing living practice.",
