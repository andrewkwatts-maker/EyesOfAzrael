  "description": "Explore the vast cosmos of Chinese mythology, where heaven operates as a bureaucracy, immortals cultivate the Dao, and dragons bring fortune.",
  "overview": "Chinese mythology encompasses over 4,000 years of diverse religious and philosophical traditions including Confucianism, Daoism, and Chinese Buddhism. The mythological system features the Jade Emperor ruling a celestial bureaucracy mirroring earthly governance, the quest for immortality through Daoist alchemy and cultivation, the Dragon Kings controlling waters and weather, the journey to the West seeking Buddhist scriptures, and the balance of Yin-Yang forces. Chinese mythology emphasizes harmony between heaven, earth, and humanity (tian-di-ren), filial piety, ancestor veneration, and the cultivation of virtue. The mythology blends historical figures deified after death, immortals (xian) who achieved transcendence, and primordial cosmic forces.",
