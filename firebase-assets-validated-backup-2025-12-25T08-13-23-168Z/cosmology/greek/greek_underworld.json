    "Cape Taenarum (Southern Greece): A cave-shrine to Poseidon said to descend directly to Hades. Heracles used this entrance to capture Cerberus.",
    "Lake Avernus (Italy): A volcanic crater lake whose poisonous vapors killed birds flying overhead, marking it as a gateway to death.",
    "River Acheron (Epirus): The river of woe, where souls gathered before crossing into Hades proper.",
    "Caves of Eleusis: Connected to the mysteries of Demeter and Persephone, involving descent symbolism.",
    "Tantalus: Stands in water that recedes when he tries to drink, beneath fruit trees whose branches rise when he reaches—eternal hunger and thirst for serving his son to the gods.",
    "Sisyphus: Pushes a boulder up a mountain, only for it to roll back down forever—punishment for cheating death twice.",
    "Ixion: Bound to a flaming wheel that spins forever through the sky for attempting to seduce Hera.",
    "The Danaids: Forty-nine daughters of Danaus who murdered their husbands on their wedding night; they eternally carry water in sieves to fill a leaking bath.",
    "Tityos: A giant whose liver is eternally eaten by vultures (regenerating daily) for attempting to rape Leto.",
    "The Titans: Kronos and his followers, imprisoned after Zeus's victory, suffer in the deepest darkness.",
    "Thanatos: Personification of death itself, twin brother of Hypnos (Sleep). He escorts souls to Hades.",
    "Charon: The grim ferryman who transports souls across the rivers Styx and Acheron for the price of an obol.",
    "Cerberus: The three-headed guard dog who prevents souls from escaping.",
    "The Erinyes (Furies): Alecto, Megaera, and Tisiphone—ancient goddesses who pursue those guilty of blood crimes, especially kinslaying.",
    "Hecate: Goddess of crossroads, magic, and the liminal spaces between life and death. She aided Demeter in finding Persephone.",
    "Hypnos: God of sleep, dwelling in a dark cave in the Underworld, twin of Thanatos.",
    "Death is Final: Once dead, souls cannot return to life (with extremely rare exceptions granted by the gods).",
    "No Eating: Living visitors must not eat Underworld food or they cannot return. Persephone ate six pomegranate seeds, binding her to spend six months yearly in Hades.",
    "Proper Burial Required: Without proper funeral rites and the obol for Charon, souls cannot enter Hades but wander the banks of Cocytus for a hundred years.",
    "Don't Look Back: When granted permission to leave (as Orpheus was), one must not look back at the Underworld or the deal is broken.",
    "Respect the Dead: Shades must receive periodic libations and offerings from the living. Neglected dead become restless and vengeful.",
    "Divine Permission Needed: Only with the gods' blessing can living mortals descend and return (katabasis)—an extremely rare occurrence."
