  "longDescription": "Sanliurfa Province, Southeastern Turkey Gobekli Tepe (Turkish: \"Potbelly Hill\") is the oldest known megalithic structure in the world, predating\n                Stonehenge by approximately 6,000 years and the Egyptian pyramids by 7,000 years. Dating to approximately\n                9600-8000 BCE, this Pre-Pottery Neolithic site was constructed by hunter-gatherers who had not yet developed\n                agriculture, writing, or metal tools. Its discovery in 1994 by German archaeologist Klaus Schmidt\n                revolutionized our understanding of prehistoric civilization, suggesting that organized religion and\n                monumental architecture preceded - and perhaps drove - the development of agriculture and settled society.",
