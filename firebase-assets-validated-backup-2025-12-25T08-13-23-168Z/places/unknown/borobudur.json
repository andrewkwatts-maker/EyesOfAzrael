The monument\n                consists of nine stacked platforms—six square and three circular—topped by a central dome, all constructed from approximately\n                2 million blocks of volcanic andesite stone quarried from nearby rivers. The entire structure is decorated with 2,672\n                relief panels and originally contained 504 Buddha statues, creating a monumental three-dimensional mandala that physically\n                embodies the Buddhist path to enlightenment.",
