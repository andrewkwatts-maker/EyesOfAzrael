Built between 447 and 432 BCE during the Golden Age of\n                Athens under the leadership of Pericles, this Doric temple was dedicated to Athena Parthenos (\"Athena\n                the Virgin\"), patron goddess of Athens. The Parthenon represents the pinnacle of Classical Greek\n                architecture and embodies the ideals of democracy, wisdom, and civic virtue that defined Athens at the\n                height of its power.",
