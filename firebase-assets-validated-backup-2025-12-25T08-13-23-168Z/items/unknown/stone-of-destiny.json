Every High King of Ireland was inaugurated on\n                    this stone. The stone's cry confirmed divine favor and the land's acceptance of its\n                    new ruler, essential components of Celtic sacral kingship.\n                \n                \n                    Legend states that the hero Cu Chulainn struck the stone in anger when it failed to\n                    cry out for him (he was not meant to be king), and from that day it never spoke again\n                    except for two occasions: under Conn of the Hundred Battles and under his grandson\n                    Cormac mac Airt.\n                \n\n                Scottish Connection\n                \n                    According to Scottish tradition, the Stone of Destiny was taken to Scotland in ancient\n                    times and became the Stone of Scone, used for the coronation of Scottish kings at Scone\n                    Abbey. Whether this is the same stone or a different coronation stone is debated.\n                \n                \n                    In 1296, King Edward I of England seized the Stone of Scone and took it to Westminster\n                    Abbey, where it was incorporated into the coronation chair. English and later British\n                    monarchs were crowned over it for seven centuries until it was returned to Scotland in 1996.",
