  _type: 'cosmology',
  cosmologyProperties: {
    subtype: 'creation-myth' | 'afterlife' | 'underworld' | ...,
    realm: 'cosmic' | 'physical' | 'mythical',
    sections: [{ heading, content, subsections }]
  },
  structuredContent: {
    sections: [], // Detailed multi-level structure

## Critical Importance

Cosmology and rituals are **foundational content** that:

1. **Provide Context** for entire mythological systems
2. **Explain Beliefs** about creation, death, and cosmic order
3. **Document Practices** that enacted these beliefs
4. **Enable Understanding** of deity roles and relationships
5. **Support Comparison** across mythological traditions

Without proper cosmology and ritual documentation, the mythology system lacks coherent structure.
