            <div class="content-text">
                <p>
                    Vijaya (Sanskrit: "Victory") stands as one of the two supreme celestial bows in Hindu epic
                    literature, the divine counterpart and equal to Arjuna's Gandiva. This legendary weapon was
                    wielded by Karna, the tragic hero of the Mahabharata - born to Kunti and the Sun God Surya
                    but abandoned at birth and raised as a charioteer's son. Vijaya represented Karna's claim
                    to divine favor despite his outcast status.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While Gandiva was associated with the righteous Pandava cause, Vijaya embodied the principle
                    that divine weapons answer to individual virtue and martial excellence regardless of birth
                    or political allegiance. Karna's possession of this bow marked him as a warrior equal to
                    any of the Pandavas despite his lower social status.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The bow's name - meaning "victorious" or "granting victory" - was not merely descriptive
                    but prescriptive: the wielder of Vijaya was destined to triumph in battle. Only through
                    the combined effects of curses, deceptions, and the active intervention of Krishna could
                    Arjuna ultimately prevail against Karna in their final confrontation.

            <div class="content-text">
                <h4 class="subsection-title">Divine Creation</h4>
                <p>
                    Vijaya was created by Vishvakarma, the divine architect and craftsman of the gods,
                    at the request of Lord Shiva. Unlike many celestial weapons that emerged during the
                    churning of the cosmic ocean or were fashioned by Brahma at creation, Vijaya was
                    specifically commissioned for Shiva's use in combating demonic forces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vishvakarma imbued the bow with invincibility - the guarantee that its wielder would
                    never be defeated while holding it. This was not merely extraordinary power but a
                    cosmic principle: Vijaya literally meant that victory was inherent in the weapon itself.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">From Shiva to Indra</h4>
                <p>
                    Lord Shiva initially used Vijaya to destroy the three flying cities of the demons
                    (Tripurasura), demonstrating its power to annihilate even the most formidable fortresses.
                    After this victory, Shiva bestowed the bow upon Indra, king of the gods, who in turn
                    passed it to Parashurama, the sixth avatar of Vishnu.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Parashurama and Karna</h4>
                <p>
                    Parashurama, the immortal warrior-sage who had sworn to exterminate the Kshatriya (warrior)
                    class, eventually became Karna's teacher. Karna, seeking martial education despite his
                    supposed low birth, approached Parashurama by claiming to be a Brahmin - the only caste
                    Parashurama would teach.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Impressed by Karna's exceptional talent and dedication, Parashurama taught him all
                    his martial arts and eventually bestowed upon him Vijaya. However, when Parashurama
                    later discovered Karna's deception about his caste (after a incident where Karna's
                    blood proved he was not a Brahmin), he cursed Karna to forget the Brahmastra at the
                    moment he needed it most - though he allowed Karna to keep Vijaya.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "Take this bow Vijaya, O Karna. As long as you wield it, no enemy can defeat you in battle.
                This bow was used by Shiva to destroy Tripura, and by Indra to vanquish the demons. It will
                bring you victory in all your battles."

                    <strong>Invincibility in Battle</strong>
                    The fundamental property of Vijaya was guaranteed victory. As long as Karna wielded the
                    bow, he was destined to triumph. This was not merely great power but a cosmic principle
                    embedded in the weapon.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Equality with Gandiva</strong>
                    Vijaya was explicitly described as equal to Arjuna's Gandiva, meaning the two archers
                    could never truly defeat each other in fair combat while wielding their respective bows.
                    The duel between Karna and Arjuna was a clash of equals.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Astra Amplification</strong>
                    Divine missiles (astras) launched from Vijaya gained additional power. The bow could
                    channel any astra known to its wielder, enhancing their destructive capacity and
                    ensuring accurate delivery.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Inexhaustible Capability</strong>
                    Like other celestial bows, Vijaya never wore out, never needed maintenance, and its
                    string never required replacement. It could fire unlimited arrows without degradation.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Defensive Aura</strong>
                    The bow generated a protective field around its wielder, deflecting many attacks
                    automatically and providing warning of incoming threats.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Penetrating Power</strong>
                    Arrows from Vijaya could pierce any armor, shield, or magical barrier, similar to
                    other celestial weapons but with particular emphasis on overcoming divine protections.

                <h4 class="subsection-title">The Tragic Fate</h4>
                <p>
                    Despite possessing one of the two supreme bows in existence, Karna's path was marked
                    by tragedy. Multiple curses and circumstances combined to ensure his defeat despite
                    Vijaya's invincibility:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Parashurama's Curse:</strong> He would forget critical knowledge at the
                    crucial moment</li>
                    <li><strong>Brahmin's Curse:</strong> His chariot wheel would sink into the earth at
                    a fateful time</li>
                    <li><strong>Gift to Indra:</strong> He gave away his divine armor and earrings, which
                    had made him truly invulnerable</li>
                    <li><strong>Promise to Kunti:</strong> He vowed not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">The Final Duel</h4>
                <p>
                    The confrontation between Karna with Vijaya and Arjuna with Gandiva was the climactic
                    moment of the Kurukshetra War. When the two supreme archers faced each other, their
                    bows were evenly matched - neither could gain advantage through weaponry alone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The duel reached its crisis when Karna's chariot wheel sank into the earth (as cursed)
                    and he dismounted to free it. At this moment, with Karna's hands not on Vijaya, he was
                    vulnerable. Despite the code of warrior honor forbidding attacks on an unarmed opponent,
                    Krishna urged Arjuna to strike, citing all the times Karna had violated dharma.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Arjuna's arrow struck Karna while he struggled with his chariot wheel. The greatest
                    warrior of the Kauravas fell not through superior martial skill but through the
                    accumulated weight of karma and curse. Vijaya, untouched by Karna's hands, could
                    not save him.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">The Symbolism</h4>
                <p>
                    Karna's death while separated from Vijaya carries profound symbolic weight. Despite
                    possessing the weapon of guaranteed victory, Karna could not escape his fate. The
                    message is clear: divine weapons cannot overcome accumulated karma. Victory depends
                    not only on power but on righteousness, proper action, and the complex web of
                    consequences that each person weaves through their choices.

                <h4 class="subsection-title">The Duality with Gandiva</h4>
                <p>
                    The existence of two equal celestial bows - Gandiva and Vijaya - reflects the Mahabharata's
                    nuanced moral universe. Unlike simple good-versus-evil narratives, the epic presents two
                    sides with legitimate claims and comparable divine support. Vijaya's equality with Gandiva
                    suggests that Karna was as worthy a warrior as Arjuna.

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Karna's Tragedy</h4>
                <p>
                    Vijaya becomes a symbol of unfulfilled potential in Karna's story. He possessed the weapon
                    of invincibility yet fell to circumstances beyond his control - curses earned through past
                    deceptions, loyalty to a corrupt prince, and the accumulated weight of others' machinations.
                    The bow highlights what could have been if fate had dealt differently with the sun god's son.

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Merit versus Birth</h4>
                <p>
                    Karna's possession of Vijaya challenges caste-based assumptions about worthiness. Born to
                    a god but raised by low-caste parents, Karna earned through his own efforts a weapon that
                    proved his equality with the highest-born warriors. Vijaya becomes a statement about
                    individual merit transcending social categories.
