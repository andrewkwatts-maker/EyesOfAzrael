                <p>
                    Excalibur stands as perhaps the most famous sword in Western literature and mythology, the
                    legendary blade of King Arthur that has come to symbolize rightful sovereignty, noble kingship,
                    and the ideals of chivalry. For over a thousand years, the story of this magical sword has
                    captivated audiences, evolving from early Welsh and Celtic traditions into the cornerstone of
                    Arthurian legend that continues to inspire countless adaptations today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The name "Excalibur" derives from the Welsh "Caledfwlch" (meaning "hard breach" or "hard cleft"),
                    which was Latinized as "Caliburnus" by Geoffrey of Monmouth in the 12th century, eventually
                    becoming "Excalibur" in Old French romances. This linguistic journey mirrors the sword's own
                    mythological evolution from a Celtic warrior's weapon to the supreme symbol of Christian kingship
                    in medieval romance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the literary tradition, Excalibur is typically described as a magnificent longsword of
                    extraordinary craftsmanship, its blade gleaming with supernatural radiance. The sword's
                    brightness is repeatedly emphasized in medieval texts, where it is said to shine with the
                    light of thirty torches or blind enemies with its brilliance. Some accounts describe runes or
                    mysterious inscriptions along the blade, while others emphasize a golden hilt adorned with
                    precious gems.

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Blade:</strong> A double-edged longsword of exceptional length and balance, forged
                    from otherworldly metals in the realm of Avalon, capable of cutting through any armor or weapon</li>
                    <li><strong>Radiance:</strong> Emits a supernatural light, sometimes described as blinding to
                    enemies, representing divine favor and righteous authority</li>
                    <li><strong>Inscriptions:</strong> Various accounts describe inscriptions on both sides of the
                    blade, one side reading "Take me up" and the other "Cast me away"</li>
                    <li><strong>Hilt:</strong> Adorned with gold and precious stones, sometimes described as bearing
                    images of serpents or dragons with jeweled eyes</li>
                    <li><strong>Scabbard:</strong> Equally magical, the scabbard prevents its bearer from losing

                    <li><strong>Weight:</strong> Despite its size, perfectly balanced and feels light in the hands
                    of the rightful king, impossibly heavy to all others</li>
                    <li><strong>Edge:</strong> Supernaturally sharp, never dulls, capable of cutting through stone
                    and steel as easily as cloth</li>

            <div class="content-text">
                <p>
                    The visual depiction of Excalibur has evolved significantly over the centuries. Early Welsh
                    traditions likely imagined a Celtic sword appropriate to the post-Roman period, while medieval
                    artists depicted it as a knightly longsword of their own era. Modern interpretations range from
                    ornate fantasy weapons to historically grounded designs, but certain elements remain constant:
                    the sense of otherworldly power, the connection to legitimate rule, and the sword's ultimate
                    return to the mystical waters from whence it came.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps most significant is Excalibur's scabbard, which in many versions of the legend holds
                    even greater power than the sword itself. Thomas Malory's "Le Morte d'Arthur" emphasizes that
                    the scabbard's power to prevent blood loss made it more valuable than the blade, and its theft
                    by Morgan le Fay ultimately contributed to Arthur's downfall. This detail underscores a theme
                    central to the Arthurian legend: the importance of protection and preservation over mere
                    offensive power.

            <div class="content-text">
                <p>
                    The origin of Excalibur presents one of the most interesting complexities in Arthurian legend,
                    as two distinct traditions have become intertwined over centuries of storytelling. In one
                    tradition, Arthur proves his right to rule by drawing a sword from a stone or anvil. In
                    another, he receives Excalibur from the Lady of the Lake. Modern interpretations often treat
                    these as two different swords, though many classical sources conflate them.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">The Sword in the Stone</h4>
                <p>
                    The most famous version of Arthur's acquisition of his sword comes from the "Sword in the Stone"
                    narrative. Following the death of Uther Pendragon, Britain fell into chaos as various lords
                    fought for the throne. To resolve the succession crisis, Merlin the wizard arranged for a sword
                    to appear, thrust through an anvil and into a stone, in the churchyard of the greatest church
                    in London (often identified as St. Paul's).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Upon the stone appeared an inscription declaring that whoever could draw the sword from the
                    stone was the rightful king of all Britain. Many knights attempted the feat during the
                    tournament that followed, but none could budge the blade. Young Arthur, serving as squire to
                    his foster brother Sir Kay, drew the sword effortlessly when Kay forgot his own weapon and
                    sent Arthur to fetch a replacement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At first, the nobles refused to accept that an unknown youth could be king. Arthur replaced
                    the sword and drew it again, multiple times, proving beyond doubt that the miracle was real.
                    This sword represented Arthur's birthright as Uther's true son and his divine appointment
                    as Britain's king. Some traditions end this sword's story here, while others have it break
                    in Arthur's first major battle, necessitating Excalibur's acquisition from the Lady of the Lake.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">The Lady of the Lake</h4>
                <p>
                    In the tradition popularized by Thomas Malory and others, Arthur receives Excalibur from
                    the Lady of the Lake, a powerful enchantress who dwells in an otherworldly realm beneath
                    or beyond a magical lake. After Arthur's original sword (whether from the stone or not)
                    breaks in combat, Merlin leads the young king to this mystical body of water.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As they approach, an arm clothed in white samite (a heavy silk fabric) rises from the water,
                    holding a magnificent sword. A beautiful woman appears, walking on the water itself, and
                    identifies herself as the Lady of the Lake. She offers Arthur the sword, named Excalibur,
                    in exchange for a future favor. Arthur agrees and rows out to take the sword from the
                    mysterious arm, which then disappears beneath the waves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Merlin asks Arthur which he prizes more, the sword or the scabbard. When Arthur chooses
                    the sword, Merlin chides him, explaining that the scabbard is worth ten swords, for while
                    Arthur wears it, he will never lose blood from his wounds, no matter how grievously he is
                    injured. This exchange foreshadows the tragedy to come when Morgan le Fay steals the
                    scabbard, leaving Arthur vulnerable.

                <h4 class="subsection-title">The Forging in Avalon</h4>
                <p>
                    Some versions of the legend provide additional detail about Excalibur's creation. The sword
                    was forged in Avalon, the mystical island of apples associated with Celtic otherworld
                    traditions. Avalon represents the realm between worlds, a place where time flows differently
                    and where the powers of magic remain undiminished.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The smiths of Avalon, whether fairy, elvish, or divine, created Excalibur using methods
                    unknown to mortal craftsmen. Some traditions suggest the blade was forged from a meteorite,
                    metal that fell from the heavens bearing cosmic power. Others describe mystical fires and
                    enchantments woven into every fold of the steel. The Lady of the Lake served as guardian
                    of the blade, holding it until one worthy of its power should appear.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Welsh and Celtic Antecedents</h4>
                <p>
                    Before the French romances transformed Arthurian legend, Welsh tradition spoke of
                    Caledfwlch, Arthur's sword in the Mabinogion and other early texts. This weapon appears
                    in "Culhwch and Olwen," one of the earliest Arthurian tales, listed among Arthur's
                    prized possessions. The name connects to Irish mythology's Caladbolg, the sword of
                    Fergus mac Roich, suggesting a common Celtic origin for these legendary blades.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In these earlier traditions, the sword's powers are less defined but no less significant.
                    Caledfwlch is simply one of Arthur's great treasures, alongside his ship, his shield
                    Wynebgwrthucher, and his spear Rhongomyniad. The sword's evolution into the central
                    symbol of Arthurian legend occurred primarily through French and English medieval romances,
                    which emphasized its connection to legitimate sovereignty and divine right.

                <h4 class="subsection-title">The Return to the Lake</h4>
                <p>
                    Excalibur's story ends as it began, with water. After the Battle of Camlann, where Arthur
                    received his mortal wound from Mordred, the dying king commanded Sir Bedivere (or Griflet
                    in some versions) to return Excalibur to the Lady of the Lake. Twice Bedivere could not
                    bring himself to throw away such a magnificent weapon and hid it instead. Arthur, sensing
                    the deception, demanded to know what Bedivere saw.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only when Bedivere honestly cast the sword did the miracle occur: an arm rose from the
                    water, caught Excalibur, brandished it three times, and drew it beneath the waves.
                    Bedivere reported this to Arthur, who knew then that his command had been fulfilled.
                    The king was then carried away to Avalon by mysterious women in a black barge, leaving
                    open the possibility that he might one day return in Britain's greatest hour of need.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This cyclical journey, from the otherworld lake to the king and back again, emphasizes
                    that Excalibur was never truly Arthur's possession. It was loaned to him for the duration
                    of his reign, to be returned when his time ended. The sword belongs to the otherworld,
                    to the mystical forces that briefly invest mortal rulers with divine authority.

            <div class="content-text">
                <p>
                    Excalibur possesses numerous supernatural properties that make it far more than an ordinary
                    weapon, however finely crafted. These powers reflect the sword's role as a symbol of
                    righteous kingship, divine favor, and the magical traditions of Celtic and medieval romance.
                    Importantly, many of Excalibur's greatest powers come from its scabbard rather than the
                    blade itself, a detail that carries significant symbolic weight.

                    <strong>Invincibility in Battle</strong>
                    While wielding Excalibur, Arthur never loses a fair fight. The sword grants its bearer
                    supreme martial prowess, ensuring victory against any opponent. This power represents
                    the divine mandate behind Arthur's rule and his role as Britain's champion.

                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Blinding Radiance</strong>
                    Excalibur shines with supernatural light, variously described as the brightness of thirty
                    torches or the radiance of the sun itself. This light can blind enemies in battle,
                    representing the illuminating power of truth and justice.

                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Unbreakable Edge</strong>
                    The blade never dulls and can cut through any material, including armor, weapons, and
                    even stone. No earthly defense can withstand a blow from Excalibur when wielded with
                    righteous purpose.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Proof of Sovereignty</strong>
                    Only the rightful king can draw Excalibur from the stone or wield it effectively. The
                    sword serves as a test and proof of legitimate rule, recognizing only those with the
                    right to rule Britain.

                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Wound Prevention (Scabbard)</strong>
                    The scabbard prevents its bearer from losing blood, no matter how severe their wounds.
                    This makes the wielder effectively invulnerable in battle, able to continue fighting
                    despite injuries that would kill ordinary men.

                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Protection from Treachery (Scabbard)</strong>
                    Some versions suggest the scabbard also protects against magical attacks and treacherous
                    wounds, ensuring the king can only be harmed through fair means when properly equipped.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Symbol of Unity</strong>
                    Excalibur serves as a rallying symbol that unifies the knights of the Round Table and
                    the people of Britain. Its presence inspires loyalty and courage, creating bonds of
                    fellowship that transcend personal rivalries.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Connection to Avalon</strong>
                    As a weapon forged in Avalon, Excalibur maintains a connection to the otherworld. Some
                    traditions suggest this allows the wielder to perceive truth, resist enchantments, or
                    even glimpse the future.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Worthiness Requirement</strong>
                    Like Mjolnir in Norse mythology, Excalibur can only be properly wielded by the worthy.
                    In unworthy hands, the sword becomes impossibly heavy or refuses to cut, ensuring that
                    its power cannot be misused by tyrants.

                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Supernatural Sharpness</strong>
                    One stroke from Excalibur is said to be worth twenty from any other blade. The sword
                    amplifies the strength and skill of its wielder, allowing Arthur to perform feats
                    impossible for ordinary warriors.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="content-text">
                <h4 class="subsection-title">The Importance of the Scabbard</h4>
                <p>
                    Medieval authors repeatedly emphasize that Excalibur's scabbard is more valuable than the
                    sword itself. This seemingly paradoxical statement carries deep symbolic significance.
                    The sword represents offensive power, the ability to strike down enemies and impose one's
                    will. The scabbard represents defensive power, protection, and preservation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A good king needs both, but preservation ultimately matters more than conquest. Arthur's
                    tragedy stems partly from his failure to properly value and protect the scabbard. When
                    Morgan le Fay steals it and throws it into a lake, Arthur loses his invulnerability.
                    This sets up his eventual death at Camlann, where he can finally be mortally wounded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The scabbard thus represents the fragility of power and the importance of vigilance.
                    All the offensive capability in the world cannot protect against betrayal and loss.
                    Arthur's kingdom falls not because he lacks the power to defeat enemies but because
                    the bonds of loyalty and protection that held it together are gradually eroded.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Limitations and Conditions</h4>
                <p>
                    Despite its tremendous power, Excalibur has clear limitations. The sword serves
                    righteous rule, not personal ambition. When Arthur acts unjustly or his kingdom
                    strays from virtue, the sword's power wanes. The tragedy of Camelot shows that
                    even the greatest magical weapon cannot prevent human folly and moral failure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, Excalibur must be returned when Arthur's reign ends. The sword is
                    a loan, not a permanent possession. This reflects the medieval understanding of
                    kingship as a responsibility rather than a right, and of royal power as something
                    granted by higher authorities (whether divine or magical) that can be withdrawn.

            <div class="content-text">
                <h4 class="subsection-title">King Arthur Pendragon</h4>
                <p>
                    Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon and Igraine of Cornwall, is the legendary king of Britain
                    whose story has inspired countless works of literature, art, and popular culture. Whether
                    based on a historical figure from the post-Roman period or entirely mythological, Arthur
                    has become the archetypal good king, the standard against which all other rulers are measured.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Raised in obscurity by Sir Ector, unaware of his royal heritage, Arthur discovered his
                    destiny when he drew the sword from the stone. With Merlin's guidance, he united Britain's
                    warring kingdoms, drove back Saxon invaders, and established Camelot as a beacon of
                    civilization and chivalry. He gathered the greatest knights at the Round Table, where all
                    sat as equals in service to justice and the realm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Arthur's reign represents a golden age, but it is not without shadow. His affair with
                    Morgause (sometimes conflated with Morgan le Fay), which produced his son and eventual
                    killer Mordred, plants the seeds of destruction. The quest for the Holy Grail scatters
                    his knights and drains the kingdom's strength. Lancelot's affair with Queen Guinevere
                    fractures the fellowship of the Round Table. Finally, civil war with Mordred destroys
                    what remains.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout these trials, Excalibur remains Arthur's constant companion, the symbol of
                    his authority and his connection to the mystical forces that support righteous rule.
                    Only at the end, mortally wounded, does Arthur part with the sword, returning it to
                    the otherworld from whence it came.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">The Battle with Pellinore</h4>
                <p>
                    One of the most significant early appearances of Excalibur (in its Lady of the Lake
                    origin) comes in Arthur's combat with King Pellinore. This battle, recounted in Malory's
                    work, establishes the sword's supernatural power and the importance of the scabbard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pellinore, a mighty king who had bested many of Arthur's knights, engaged the young
                    king in single combat. Arthur's original sword broke against Pellinore's blade, and
                    the king would have been slain had Merlin not intervened with enchantments. This defeat
                    demonstrated that even Arthur needed supernatural aid to fulfill his destiny.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When Merlin took Arthur to receive Excalibur from the Lady of the Lake, the wizard
                    explicitly asked whether Arthur valued the sword or scabbard more. Arthur's preference
                    for the sword over the scabbard foreshadowed his later tragedy, as the scabbard's loss
                    would ultimately contribute to his death.

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Major Myths Featuring Excalibur:</h4>

                <p><strong>1. The Sword in the Stone</strong></p>
                <p>
                    The most famous Excalibur story tells how the young, unknown Arthur proved his right to
                    rule by drawing a sword that no other knight could move. This miracle, arranged by Merlin,
                    demonstrated divine selection of the king. The narrative emphasizes that true royalty is
                    a matter of inner worth, not merely birth or strength, as the humble squire succeeds
                    where mighty warriors fail.
                </p>

                <p><strong>2. The Lady of the Lake's Gift</strong></p>
                <p>
                    After Arthur's original sword breaks in combat, Merlin guides him to a magical lake where
                    an arm clothed in white samite rises from the water, holding Excalibur. The Lady of the
                    Lake emerges and offers Arthur the sword in exchange for a future favor. This transaction
                    binds Arthur to the otherworld and establishes obligations that shape his reign.
                </p>

                <p><strong>3. Morgan le Fay's Theft</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Arthur's half-sister Morgan le Fay, a powerful sorceress, steals both Excalibur and its
                    scabbard. She gives the sword to her lover Accolon, who uses it against Arthur in combat.
                    The Lady of the Lake intervenes, causing Accolon to lose grip on the sword, allowing
                    Arthur to recover it. However, Morgan throws the scabbard into a lake, depriving Arthur
                    of its protection forever. This betrayal foreshadows the familial treachery that will
                    ultimately destroy Camelot.
                </p>

                <p><strong>4. The Final Battle and Return</strong></p>
                <p>
                    At Camlann, Arthur fights his final battle against Mordred. Both mortally wound each
                    other, fulfilling the doom prophesied long before. Dying, Arthur commands Sir Bedivere
                    to return Excalibur to the lake. Bedivere twice hides the sword, unwilling to dispose
                    of such a treasure, but finally obeys. An arm rises from the water, catches the sword,
                    and draws it down, closing the cycle that began with the sword's emergence.

                <p><strong>5. The Once and Future King</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Arthurian legend holds that Arthur does not truly die but sleeps in Avalon, waiting
                    to return when Britain faces its greatest need. Excalibur presumably waits with him,
                    or in the lake, ready to be wielded again when the Once and Future King awakens. This
                    messianic element has kept the Arthurian legend alive through centuries, as each
                    generation wonders if their crisis might be the one to summon Arthur back.

                <p>
                    While Arthur is Excalibur's true wielder, others have attempted to claim or use the sword:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sir Accolon:</strong> Morgan le Fay's lover, who received the stolen sword
                    and fought Arthur with it, nearly killing the king before supernatural intervention
                    caused the sword to fall from his grasp</li>
                    <li><strong>Sir Gawain:</strong> Some versions suggest Gawain briefly wielded Excalibur
                    in Arthur's absence, though he never claimed it as his own</li>
                    <li><strong>The Countless Pretenders:</strong> Many knights attempted to draw the sword
                    from the stone before Arthur, all failing, demonstrating that strength and reputation
                    alone do not make a true king</li>
                    <li><strong>Mordred:</strong> As Arthur's son, Mordred may have attempted to claim
                    Excalibur after seizing the throne, but the sword would not serve one who gained
                    power through treachery</li>

        <!-- SYMBOLISM -->
        <div class="glass-card">
            <h3 class="section-title">Symbolism and Spiritual Meaning</h3>
            <div class="content-text">
                <h4 class="subsection-title">Divine Right and Legitimate Rule</h4>
                <p>
                    Excalibur's primary symbolic function is to establish and demonstrate legitimate sovereignty.
                    The sword serves as tangible proof that Arthur's kingship is not merely the result of
                    conquest or inheritance but of divine selection. Only the true king can draw the sword
                    or receive it from supernatural guardians, making Excalibur the ultimate legitimizing force.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This symbolism reflected medieval political theory, which held that true kings ruled by
                    God's will, not merely by force. The Arthurian legend, while not explicitly Christian in
                    its earliest forms, was Christianized to support this ideology. Excalibur became a symbol
                    of the harmony between earthly power and heavenly sanction, representing the ideal of
                    just rule under divine guidance.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Justice and Righteous Authority</h4>
                <p>
                    The sword's ability to cut through anything represents the penetrating power of justice,
                    which should be able to pierce any defense erected by the guilty. Its blinding light
                    symbolizes truth that dispels the darkness of lies and corruption. Excalibur cannot be
                    used for unjust purposes, reflecting the ideal that true power serves righteousness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When Arthur's kingdom degenerates through the affair of Lancelot and Guinevere, through
                    factional rivalries, and through the corruption of the Grail Quest, Excalibur's power
                    cannot save it. The sword judges not just enemies but its wielder, and a king who fails
                    to maintain justice loses the ability to benefit from justice's symbol.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">The Otherworld and Fairy Power</h4>
                <p>
                    Excalibur's origin from the Lady of the Lake connects it to Celtic traditions of the
                    otherworld, a parallel realm of magic and eternal youth. In Celtic mythology, gifts from
                    the otherworld often come with obligations and eventual returns. Arthur's sword follows
                    this pattern, empowering his reign but ultimately returning to its supernatural source.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This connection emphasizes that Arthur's power is not entirely his own. He rules by the
                    grace of forces beyond mortal understanding, represented by the Lady of the Lake and the
                    mystical island of Avalon. When these forces withdraw their support, as symbolized by
                    Excalibur's return, even the greatest king must fall.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Unity and the Common Cause</h4>
                <p>
                    The Round Table, inseparable from Excalibur in Arthurian symbolism, represents equality
                    and unity among the knights. Excalibur is the sword around which this unity forms, the
                    symbol that transforms individual warriors into a fellowship dedicated to common ideals.
                    The sword represents not just royal authority but the possibility of cooperation and
                    shared purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the Round Table breaks apart, when Lancelot and Arthur become enemies and the
                    knights take sides, Excalibur cannot repair the damage. The sword symbolizes an ideal
                    of unity that requires human commitment to maintain. The legend's tragedy shows that
                    even the greatest symbols cannot prevent human failure.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">The British National Myth</h4>
                <p>
                    Arthur and Excalibur have served as central symbols of British national identity for
                    centuries. The legend of the king who will return in Britain's hour of greatest need
                    has been invoked during numerous crises, from medieval wars to the World Wars of the
                    twentieth century. Excalibur represents the enduring spirit of the nation, the ideal
                    of noble leadership that transcends particular rulers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This national symbolism extends beyond Britain, as many nations and movements have
                    adopted Arthurian imagery to legitimize their causes. The universality of the legend
                    shows how effectively Excalibur embodies ideals of just rule, noble purpose, and
                    the hope that good will ultimately triumph.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Loss and the Passing of Golden Ages</h4>
                <p>
                    Excalibur's return to the lake symbolizes the inevitable passing of golden ages.
                    Arthur's reign represents an ideal that cannot be maintained indefinitely in a
                    flawed world. The sword's disappearance marks not just a king's death but the end
                    of an era, the transition from a time of wonders to more mundane ages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yet the sword is not destroyed, merely withdrawn. This preserves hope that the
                    golden age might return, that Excalibur might one day rise again from the waters
                    to arm a new champion of justice. The Arthurian legend thus becomes a story of
                    loss and hope, of ideals that fail but are never completely abandoned.

                <p>
                    Excalibur has appeared in countless films and television productions, each interpreting
                    the legendary sword according to contemporary sensibilities:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Excalibur (1981):</strong> John Boorman's visually stunning film presents the
                    sword as a gleaming weapon of terrible beauty, emphasizing its otherworldly nature and
                    connection to the land itself. The film's Excalibur is intimately linked to Merlin's
                    magic and the health of the kingdom.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Sword in the Stone (1963):</strong> Disney's animated adaptation focuses
                    on the young Arthur and his education by Merlin, culminating in the famous sword-drawing
                    scene. The film popularized the Excalibur legend for generations of children.</li>
                    <li><strong>King Arthur (2004):</strong> A more historically grounded interpretation that
                    presents Arthur as a Roman cavalry commander, with Excalibur as a Sarmatian sword passed
                    down through his family line.</li>
                    <li><strong>Merlin (BBC, 2008-2012):</strong> The television series depicts Excalibur as
                    forged in a dragon's breath, wielded by various characters before becoming Arthur's
                    defining weapon.</li>
                    <li><strong>King Arthur: Legend of the Sword (2017):</strong> Guy Ritchie's action-oriented
                    film presents Excalibur as a weapon of overwhelming magical power that transforms Arthur
                    into an unstoppable warrior when wielded.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Literature</h4>
                <p>
                    Modern authors have continually reimagined Excalibur and its significance:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>T.H. White's "The Once and Future King":</strong> The classic modern retelling
                    that deeply influenced subsequent adaptations, presenting Arthur's story with psychological
                    depth and moral complexity while maintaining Excalibur's mythic significance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mary Stewart's Merlin Trilogy:</strong> Explores the legend from Merlin's
                    perspective, with Excalibur as a symbol of the transition from pagan to Christian Britain.</li>
                    <li><strong>Marion Zimmer Bradley's "The Mists of Avalon":</strong> Presents the Arthurian
                    legend from women's perspectives, with Excalibur representing patriarchal power that
                    ultimately fails because it cannot embrace the feminine mysteries.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bernard Cornwell's "The Warlord Chronicles":</strong> A gritty, realistic take
                    that treats Excalibur as a fine sword with symbolic power but no supernatural abilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stephen Lawhead's "Pendragon Cycle":</strong> Combines Celtic mysticism with
                    Christian themes, presenting Excalibur as a sword of light against darkness.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Video Games</h4>
                <p>
                    Excalibur appears extensively in video games, often as an ultimate or legendary weapon:
                </p>

                    <li><strong>Final Fantasy Series:</strong> Excalibur appears in nearly every mainline game

                    "Sword of Promised Victory," King Arthur's Noble Phantasm that releases a devastating
                    beam of light. The Fate series' female Arthur (Artoria) has significantly influenced
                    modern perceptions of both the king and the sword.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soul Calibur Series:</strong> Features Excalibur as a powerful weapon,

                    <li><strong>Marvel Comics:</strong> Excalibur (the team) took their name from the sword,
                    while the Black Knight wields the Ebony Blade, an Excalibur counterpart. Captain Britain's
                    mythology heavily incorporates Arthurian elements.</li>
                    <li><strong>DC Comics:</strong> Various versions of the Shining Knight have wielded Excalibur,
                    and the sword has appeared in stories involving Etrigan the Demon and other mystical
                    characters.</li>
                    <li><strong>Manga and Anime:</strong> Japanese works frequently feature Excalibur, often
                    reimagining it in fantastical ways. The "Soul Eater" series famously parodies Excalibur
