            <div class="content-text">
                <p>
                    Mjolnir, whose name means "crusher" or "grinder" in Old Norse, is the legendary hammer wielded
                    by Thor, the Norse god of thunder, lightning, storms, and strength. It is arguably the most
                    famous weapon in Norse mythology and one of the most powerful artifacts in the entire Norse
                    mythological arsenal. More than just a weapon, Mjolnir serves as a symbol of Thor's divine
                    power, a tool of consecration, and the ultimate defense of Asgard and Midgard against the
                    forces of chaos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The hammer's most distinctive physical feature is its unusually short handle. According to
                    mythology, this imperfection arose during its creation when Loki, in the form of a fly,
                    interfered with the dwarven smiths' work. Despite this flaw, Mjolnir remains a weapon of
                    devastating effectiveness. The gods judged it the finest treasure ever made by dwarven hands,
                    for its power far exceeded any limitation imposed by its shortened grip.

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Head:</strong> Massive and square-shaped, forged from uru-like mystical metal
                    that can channel and amplify Thor's divine power</li>
                    <li><strong>Handle:</strong> Shorter than intended, requiring Thor to wield it one-handed
                    (though he could use two hands given his strength)</li>
                    <li><strong>Material:</strong> Forged from metal mined from the heart of a dying star or

                    <li><strong>Weight:</strong> Immeasurably heavy to mortals and most gods; only Thor (and

                    <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Often depicted with intricate knotwork patterns, runes of
                    power, and a distinctive T-shaped or cross-shaped head</li>
                    <li><strong>Glow:</strong> Crackles with lightning and emanates a blue-white radiance when
                    Thor channels his power through it</li>
                    <li><strong>Sound:</strong> Thunder accompanies its strikes, and the air itself seems to

                    Archaeological finds throughout Scandinavia have revealed hundreds of small hammer-shaped
                    amulets worn by Vikings and other Germanic peoples during the late Iron Age and Viking Age.
                    These Mjolnir pendants were worn as symbols of Thor's protection, much as Christians wore
                    crosses. The amulets show considerable variation in design—some T-shaped, others more
                    hammer-like, some ornate with elaborate decoration, others simple and functional.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In artistic depictions from the Viking Age, Mjolnir sometimes appears more like a double-bladed
                    axe or a club than a modern hammer. This reflects both the evolution of the myth and practical
                    considerations of Viking-era metalworking and weapon design. The essential characteristics
                    remain constant: it is a striking weapon of immense power, inseparable from Thor's identity
                    as the defender of gods and humanity.

        <!-- CREATION MYTH -->
        <div class="glass-card">
            <h3 class="section-title">Creation Myth and Crafting</h3>
            <div class="content-text">
                <p>
                    The creation of Mjolnir is one of the most famous tales in Norse mythology, recounted in the
                    Skáldskaparmál section of Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda. The story begins with an act of
                    mischief by Loki, the trickster god, whose schemes inadvertently led to the creation of some
                    of the gods' greatest treasures.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Loki's Mischief and the Wager</h4>
                <p>
                    Loki, in one of his malicious moods, crept into the chambers of Thor's wife Sif while she
                    slept and cut off her beautiful golden hair. When Thor discovered this outrage, his fury was
                    so terrible that Loki feared for his life. To make amends, Loki swore he would travel to
                    Svartalfheim (the realm of the dark elves or dwarves) and commission the most skilled smiths
                    to create new hair for Sif—hair made of actual gold that would grow like natural hair.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Loki approached the sons of Ivaldi, master craftsmen who agreed to forge the golden hair.
                    While they worked, they also created two additional treasures: Skidbladnir (a ship that
                    could fold up small enough to fit in a pocket yet hold all the gods) and Gungnir (Odin's
                    spear that never missed its mark).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pleased with these treasures but unable to resist further mischief, Loki sought out two
                    other dwarven brothers: Brokkr and Eitri (also called Sindri). He wagered his own head that
                    these smiths could not create three treasures to equal those made by the sons of Ivaldi.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">The Forging of Mjolnir</h4>
                <p>
                    Brokkr and Eitri accepted the wager. Eitri instructed his brother Brokkr to work the bellows
                    continuously without stopping, no matter what happened, while Eitri himself performed the
                    mystical smith-work. They began by placing pigskin in the forge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Loki, desperate to win the wager, transformed himself into a fly and began biting Brokkr to
                    distract him. First, they created Gullinbursti, a golden boar that could run through air and
                    water faster than any horse, its bristles shining to illuminate the darkest night.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, the brothers placed gold in the forge and created Draupnir, a golden arm ring that
                    would drip eight new rings of equal weight every ninth night, making it a symbol of infinite
                    wealth and prosperity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, they placed iron in the forge to create the mightiest work of all. As the metal
                    heated and began to take shape, Loki bit Brokkr on the eyelid, drawing blood. For just an
                    instant, Brokkr brushed at the fly and stopped pumping the bellows. In that moment, the
                    hammer's handle was shortened.

                <h4 class="subsection-title">The Judgment of the Gods</h4>
                <p>
                    Loki and the dwarven brothers brought their treasures before the gods in Asgard. The gods
                    served as judges, with Odin, Thor, and Freyr making the final determination. Each treasure
                    was presented and its qualities explained:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sif received her golden hair, which grew naturally and was even more beautiful than before</li>
                    <li>Odin received Gungnir, the spear that never missed, and Draupnir, the self-multiplying ring</li>
                    <li>Freyr received Skidbladnir, the miraculous ship, and Gullinbursti, the golden boar</li>
                    <li>Thor received Mjolnir, despite its shortened handle</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The gods deliberated and reached their verdict: Mjolnir was the finest treasure of all.
                    Despite its imperfect handle, no other weapon could compare to its power. With Mjolnir,
                    Thor could defend Asgard against the giants who constantly threatened the gods. The hammer
                    was deemed the greatest bulwark against the forces of chaos that would one day bring
                    Ragnarök, the twilight of the gods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having lost the wager, Loki owed Brokkr his head. However, when Brokkr came to collect,
                    Loki argued that while the dwarf could take his head, he had not wagered his neck—and
                    Brokkr could not damage the neck to remove the head. Unable to take the head, Brokkr
                    instead sewed Loki's lips shut with a leather thong, silencing the trickster's silver
                    tongue, at least temporarily.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Mystical Properties of the Forging</h4>
                <p>
                    The creation of Mjolnir involved more than mere metalwork. Dwarven smith-craft in Norse
                    mythology was a form of magic, transforming base materials into artifacts of divine power.
                    Some sources suggest the hammer was forged from metal that fell from the sky—perhaps
                    meteorite iron, which the Vikings did occasionally use and considered magical.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other traditions hold that the hammer's metal came from the heart of a dying star or was
                    drawn from the primordial fires of Muspelheim, the realm of fire. The exact rituals and
                    runes used in the forging remain known only to the dwarves, who guard such secrets jealously.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What is certain is that Mjolnir became more than a mere object—it was an extension of Thor's
                    divine essence, a channel for his power over storms, lightning, and thunder. The hammer and
                    the god became so intertwined that to speak of one was to invoke the other.

            <div class="content-text">
                <p>
                    Mjolnir possesses a vast array of supernatural powers that make it one of the most formidable
                    weapons in any mythology. These abilities extend far beyond simple combat effectiveness,
                    encompassing control over natural forces, magical properties, and even spiritual authority.

                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Lightning and Thunder Generation</strong>
                    Thor can summon lightning bolts and thunder claps by raising Mjolnir. The hammer serves as
                    both a channel and amplifier for his power over storms. When thrown, Mjolnir can call down
                    devastating lightning strikes.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Perfect Accuracy and Return</strong>
                    When thrown, Mjolnir never misses its target, regardless of distance or obstacles. After
                    striking, it automatically returns to Thor's hand like a boomerang, allowing him to attack
                    multiple enemies in rapid succession.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Devastating Impact Force</strong>
                    Mjolnir strikes with enough force to shatter mountains, crush giant skulls, and pulverize
                    even the mightiest enemies. Its impact creates shockwaves that can level entire armies.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Immovability to the Unworthy</strong>
                    Only those deemed worthy—primarily Thor himself—can lift or wield Mjolnir. To all others,
                    it is impossibly heavy, weighing more than mountains. This serves as both security and a
                    test of character.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Size Alteration</strong>
                    Mjolnir can shrink small enough to hide inside Thor's clothing or grow to enormous size.
                    This allows Thor to conceal his divine nature when traveling in disguise or to create
                    devastating attacks of immense scale.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Blessing and Consecration</strong>
                    Mjolnir can hallow or consecrate objects, places, and ceremonies. Thor used it to bless
                    marriages, funerals, and births. Raising Mjolnir over an oath made that oath binding and sacred.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Resurrection (Limited)</strong>
                    In several myths, Thor uses Mjolnir to restore life. He resurrected his goats after eating
                    them for dinner, provided their bones were unbroken and placed within their hides. This
                    suggests Mjolnir has power over death itself.

                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Flight and Levitation</strong>
                    While Thor doesn't need Mjolnir to fly (that power comes from his belt Megingjord and his
                    iron gloves), the hammer can carry him through the air when thrown, or he can use it to
                    levitate objects and people.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Giant-Slaying Effectiveness</strong>
                    Mjolnir is especially effective against giants (jötnar), the ancient enemies of the gods.
                    The hammer seems to have been specifically designed or enchanted to combat these beings,
                    making Thor the gods' primary defender against giant incursions.

                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Energy Projection</strong>
                    Thor can project devastating bolts of divine energy from Mjolnir without throwing it. These
                    blasts can demolish structures, blast enemies, or create barriers of crackling power.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Weather Control</strong>
                    Beyond merely summoning storms, Mjolnir allows Thor to control weather patterns, dispel
                    storms, create rain during drought, or calm seas for sailors. Vikings prayed to Thor for
                    favorable weather.

                    <strong>Dimensional Travel</strong>
                    Mjolnir can open passages between the Nine Realms, allowing Thor to travel from Asgard to
                    Midgard (Earth) or any other realm. The Bifrost bridge often served this purpose, but Mjolnir
                    provided an independent means of travel.

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Synergy with Thor's Other Equipment</h4>
                <p>
                    While Mjolnir is formidable alone, Thor also possesses two other items that amplify its
                    power and allow him to wield it effectively:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Járngreipr (Iron Gloves):</strong> These gauntlets allow Thor to grip Mjolnir's
                    short handle properly and protect his hands from the divine energies that surge through the
                    weapon. Without them, even Thor would find the hammer difficult to control.</li>
                    <li><strong>Megingjörð (Belt of Strength):</strong> This magical belt doubles Thor's already
                    immense strength when worn, allowing him to deliver even more devastating blows with Mjolnir
                    and to throw it with even greater force and accuracy.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Together, these three items form a complete system that makes Thor the most formidable warrior
                    in Norse mythology, capable of facing threats that would destroy any other being, god or
                    otherwise.

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Thor - The Thunder God</h4>
                <p>
                    Thor, son of Odin and the earth goddess Jord, is the Norse god of thunder, lightning, storms,
                    oak trees, strength, the protection of mankind, and also hallowing and fertility. Among the
                    Norse gods, Thor was particularly beloved by common people, while the aristocracy and warriors
                    often favored Odin. Thor represented reliability, protection, and straightforward heroism—
                    qualities that ordinary folk valued highly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Red-bearded and immensely strong, Thor possessed a straightforward, somewhat blunt personality.
                    Unlike the cunning Odin or the eloquent Loki, Thor preferred direct action to schemes and
                    strategies. When faced with a problem, his solution was usually to hit it with Mjolnir. This
                    approach, while simple, proved remarkably effective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thor resided in Thrudheim ("Place of Might") in his hall called Bilskirnir ("Lightning"),
                    the largest building known. He traveled across the sky in a chariot pulled by two massive
                    goats, Tanngrisnir ("teeth grinder") and Tanngnjóstr ("teeth barer"), whose hoofbeats created
                    the sound of thunder. When Thor was hungry on his journeys, he could slaughter and eat the
                    goats, then resurrect them the next morning with Mjolnir, provided their bones remained intact.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Thor's Role as Protector</h4>
                <p>
                    Thor's primary function was defending both Asgard (the realm of the gods) and Midgard (the
                    realm of humans) from the giants and other hostile forces. The giants—representing chaos,
                    winter, and destructive natural forces—constantly threatened to overrun the ordered cosmos.
                    Thor stood as the bulwark against this chaos, making regular expeditions to Jotunheim (the
                    giants' realm) to reduce their numbers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This protective role made Thor enormously popular among the Norse people. Farmers prayed to
                    him for protection of their fields and crops. Sailors called on him for safe passage. Warriors
                    invoked him before battle. The Mjolnir amulet became a symbol of Thor's protection, much as
                    the cross served for Christians.

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4 class="subsection-title">Famous Myths Featuring Mjolnir:</h4>

                <p><strong>1. The Theft of Mjolnir (Þrymskviða)</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps the most famous Mjolnir tale tells of how the giant Thrym stole the hammer while Thor
                    slept. Thrym demanded the goddess Freyja as his bride in exchange for Mjolnir's return. Freyja
                    refused absolutely, so Loki devised a scheme: Thor would disguise himself as Freyja, veiled as
                    a bride, and go to Thrym's hall for the "wedding."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite Thor's enormous appetite (he ate an entire ox and eight salmon at the wedding feast)
                    and his fierce eyes showing through the veil, the ruse worked long enough for Thrym to call
                    for Mjolnir to be brought forth to hallow the bride. The moment Thor's hands closed on his
                    hammer, he threw off his disguise and proceeded to slaughter Thrym, his entire family, and
                    all the giants present at the wedding. This myth, while comic in tone, demonstrates how vital
                    Mjolnir was to Thor—without it, he was vulnerable and had to resort to humiliating deception.
                </p>

                <p><strong>2. Thor's Journey to Utgard</strong></p>
                <p>
                    In this lengthy tale, Thor and Loki journey to the giant stronghold of Utgard, where the
                    giant king Utgard-Loki subjects Thor to a series of apparently simple contests. Thor fails
                    at every challenge: he cannot drain a drinking horn, cannot lift a cat from the ground, and
                    cannot win a wrestling match against an old woman. Humiliated and angry, Thor prepares to
                    attack with Mjolnir.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before he can strike, Utgard-Loki reveals that the contests were illusions and magical tricks.
                    The drinking horn connected to the ocean—and Thor had lowered sea levels worldwide. The cat
                    was actually the Midgard Serpent in disguise—and Thor had nearly lifted it from its position
                    wrapped around the world. The old woman was Old Age itself—and no one can defeat time, yet
                    Thor forced her to one knee.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Utgard-Loki begs Thor not to use Mjolnir in anger, for the destruction would be catastrophic.
                    He immediately hides his castle with illusions. Thor, frustrated but understanding that raw
                    power isn't always sufficient, returns home. The tale shows that even Mjolnir has limitations—
                    cunning and magic can sometimes confound even the mightiest weapon.
                </p>

                <p><strong>3. Thor's Fishing Trip (The Midgard Serpent)</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Thor once went fishing with the giant Hymir, using an ox head as bait. He hooked the Midgard
                    Serpent (Jörmungandr), the massive snake that encircles the world—and one of Loki's monstrous
                    children, destined to kill Thor at Ragnarök. As Thor pulled the serpent up and raised Mjolnir
                    to strike the killing blow, the terrified Hymir cut the fishing line, and the serpent sank
                    back into the depths.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some versions say Thor killed Hymir in anger for robbing him of his victory. Others say he
                    threw Mjolnir at the descending serpent but missed. This encounter foreshadows the final
                    battle between Thor and Jörmungandr at Ragnarök, when both will kill each other—Thor with
                    Mjolnir and the serpent with its venom.
                </p>

                <p><strong>4. The Consecration of Baldr's Funeral</strong></p>
                <p>
                    When Baldr, the most beloved of the gods, was killed and placed on his funeral ship, Thor
                    consecrated the pyre with Mjolnir. As he performed this sacred rite, a dwarf named Litr ran
                    in front of him. In his grief and rage, Thor kicked the dwarf into the flames. This tale
                    shows Mjolnir's role in sacred ceremonies, not just warfare—the hammer that splits giant
                    skulls also hallows funerals, marriages, and births.
                </p>

                <p><strong>5. Thor and the Giant Hrungnir</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Hrungnir, the strongest of all giants, challenged Thor to single combat. Hrungnir armed
                    himself with a massive stone club and a whetstones shield. When Thor arrived with thunder
                    and lightning crackling around him, he hurled Mjolnir from a great distance. Hrungnir threw
                    his whetstone in response.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The two missiles met in mid-air. Mjolnir shattered the whetstone, sending fragments across
                    the world (explaining why whetstone fragments are found in many places). The hammer continued
                    onward and crushed Hrungnir's skull, killing him instantly. However, a whetstone fragment
                    lodged in Thor's head, causing him pain ever after. The giant's body fell on Thor, pinning
                    him—only his son Magni was strong enough to lift it off. This demonstrates that while Mjolnir
                    can kill any enemy, even Thor is not invulnerable in battle.

            <h3 class="section-title">Symbolism and Spiritual Meaning</h3>
            <div class="content-text">
                <h4 class="subsection-title">Protection and Warding</h4>
                <p>
                    In Viking Age Scandinavia, Mjolnir symbols served as powerful protective amulets. Archaeological
                    evidence shows that people wore Mjolnir pendants continuously from childhood to death. Hammers
                    were raised at births to protect the newborn, at weddings to bless the union and ensure
                    fertility, and at funerals to guide the deceased to the afterlife.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The protective power of Mjolnir extended beyond individuals. Carved or painted hammer symbols
                    adorned ships, houses, and boundary markers. Raising a Mjolnir symbol and invoking Thor would
                    hallow a space, claiming it for the gods and civilized order against chaos and hostile forces.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Fertility and Renewal</h4>
                <p>
                    Despite being a weapon of war, Mjolnir also symbolized fertility and life-giving power. Thor's
                    connection to thunderstorms linked him to the rain that makes crops grow. His hammer's ability
                    to consecrate marriages explicitly connected it to human fertility and the continuation of
                    family lines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The resurrection of Thor's goats demonstrates Mjolnir's power over death and renewal. This
                    cyclical pattern—destruction followed by restoration—mirrors the agricultural cycle and the
                    Norse understanding of the cosmos as existing in constant tension between order and chaos,
                    creation and destruction.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Sacred Authority and Right Order</h4>
                <p>
                    When Thor raised Mjolnir over an oath, that oath became inviolable. When he consecrated a
                    marriage, that union received divine sanction. The hammer represented not just physical power
                    but legitimate spiritual authority—the right to bless, to curse, to judge, and to enforce
                    cosmic law.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This authority derived from Thor's role as maintainer of order. The giants represented not
                    just physical threats but chaos itself—the forces of entropy and destruction that would
                    reduce the cosmos to primordial disorder. Thor with Mjolnir stood against this dissolution,
                    preserving the structures that allowed civilized life to exist.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Worthiness and Virtue</h4>
                <p>
                    The fact that only the worthy could lift Mjolnir made it a symbol of moral and spiritual
                    virtue. Physical strength alone was insufficient—the would-be wielder needed some essential
                    quality that made them suitable to wield such power. In Thor's case, this worthiness derived
                    from his unwavering commitment to protecting those weaker than himself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This concept has resonated through modern adaptations, where the question "Who is worthy to
                    lift Mjolnir?" becomes a test of character. Different versions suggest different criteria—
                    courage, selflessness, willingness to sacrifice, dedication to justice—but all agree that
                    Mjolnir judges the heart, not merely the body.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">The Common Man's God</h4>
                <p>
                    Unlike Odin's spear Gungnir (associated with rulers, warriors, and the aristocracy) or
                    Freyr's magical sword (associated with prosperity and kingship), Mjolnir was a worker's tool
                    elevated to divine status. A hammer was something every farmer, craftsman, and builder used
                    daily. Thor's weapon was thus the people's weapon—straightforward, reliable, and practical.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This symbolism made Thor and Mjolnir enormously popular among common folk. While chieftains
                    might sacrifice to Odin for victory in battle or political cunning, farmers and laborers
                    prayed to Thor for protection, good harvests, and fair weather. Mjolnir represented the
                    power of honest work and direct action over cleverness and scheming.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Christian Opposition and Survival</h4>
                <p>
                    During the Christianization of Scandinavia, the Mjolnir pendant became a deliberate symbol
                    of resistance to the new faith. While Christians wore crosses, traditionalists wore hammers.
                    Some artisans even created molds that could cast both symbols, allowing them to serve both
                    religious communities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eventually, Christianity prevailed, but elements of Thor worship persisted in folk customs.
                    The blessing gestures, the protective signs drawn in the air, the invocation at important
                    life events—these continued, simply transferred to the cross and Christian saints. Thor's
                    Thursday (Thor's day) survives in English and other Germanic languages.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Modern Revival and Neo-Paganism</h4>
                <p>
                    In modern Heathenry and Norse neo-paganism, Mjolnir has experienced a dramatic revival.
                    Practitioners wear Mjolnir pendants as signs of faith, use hammer symbols to consecrate
                    sacred spaces, and invoke Thor for protection and strength. For many, Mjolnir represents
                    connection to ancestral heritage and pre-Christian European spirituality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The symbol has also been adopted by various nationalist and folk movements, sometimes
                    appropriated by extremist groups—a troubling development that most mainstream Heathen
                    communities strongly reject. The challenge facing modern Thor worshippers is reclaiming
                    their symbols from hate groups while maintaining historical authenticity.

            <h3 class="section-title">Modern Depictions in Culture</h3>
            <div class="content-text">
                <h4 class="subsection-title">Marvel Comics and Cinematic Universe</h4>
                <p>
                    The most visible modern depiction of Mjolnir comes from Marvel Comics and the Marvel Cinematic
                    Universe. Created by Stan Lee, Larry Lieber, and Jack Kirby in 1962, Marvel's Thor wields a
                    version of Mjolnir with specific rules: "Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall
                    possess the power of Thor." This worthiness enchantment, placed by Odin, is not found in
                    original Norse mythology but has become inseparable from modern perceptions of the weapon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Marvel continuity, Mjolnir is forged from Uru metal in the heart of a dying star,
                    amplifies Thor's natural abilities, and serves as a channel for his lightning powers. The MCU
                    films added visual flair with elaborate hammer spins, flight mechanics, and spectacular
                    lightning effects. The question of worthiness became central to multiple storylines, with
                    characters like Captain America, Vision, and Jane Foster proving able to lift the hammer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Marvel's Mjolnir was destroyed by Hela in "Thor: Ragnarok" (2017) but later reappeared in
                    "Avengers: Endgame" (2019) through time travel. The hammer's destruction and restoration
                    symbolized Thor's character arc from relying on external sources of power to recognizing his
                    inherent divine nature.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Video Games</h4>
                <p>
                    Mjolnir appears across countless video games with varying depictions:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>God of War (2018) and Ragnarök (2022):</strong> Thor appears as an antagonist
                    wielding Mjolnir with devastating effect, portrayed as a broken, alcoholic enforcer for
                    Odin. The game's version emphasizes the hammer's brutal destructive power and its corrupting
                    effect on Thor's character.</li>
                    <li><strong>Assassin's Creed Valhalla (2020):</strong> Players can obtain Mjolnir after
                    collecting Thor's complete armor set, gaining powerful lightning abilities. The game treats
                    the hammer as a historical artifact with mystical properties.</li>
                    <li><strong>Smite:</strong> Thor appears as a playable character whose abilities all center
                    on Mjolnir's powers—throwing it, spinning it to create barriers, and calling down lightning.</li>
                    <li><strong>Age of Mythology:</strong> Players can call upon Thor's powers, with Mjolnir
                    appearing as a devastating god power that damages all enemy units.</li>
                    <li><strong>Terraria, Minecraft (modded), and others:</strong> Mjolnir appears as a craftable
                    or findable weapon with throwing mechanics and lightning generation.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Literature and Poetry</h4>
                <p>
                    Mjolnir features in numerous works of modern fantasy and historical fiction:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rick Riordan's "Magnus Chase" series presents Thor as a somewhat buffoonish but genuinely
                    powerful deity, with Mjolnir serving as a source of comic relief due to Thor's possessiveness</li>
                    <li>Neil Gaiman's "Norse Mythology" retells classical Mjolnir stories for modern audiences,
                    including the theft by Thrym and the fishing expedition</li>
                    <li>J.R.R. Tolkien drew on Norse mythology extensively, and while Mjolnir doesn't appear
                    directly, its influence can be seen in magical weapons like Glamdring and Orcrist</li>
                    <li>Numerous fantasy novels feature hammers inspired by Mjolnir, from Brandon Sanderson's
                    Sunhammer to various role-playing game supplements</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Music and Metal Culture</h4>
                <p>
                    Mjolnir holds special significance in heavy metal culture, particularly Viking metal and folk
                    metal genres. Bands like Amon Amarth, Enslaved, Bathory, and Týr frequently reference Thor
                    and his hammer in their lyrics and imagery. The hammer symbolizes power, defiance, and
                    connection to pre-Christian European heritage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Album covers and concert backdrops regularly feature Mjolnir imagery. Some performers wear
                    Mjolnir pendants on stage, and the raised hammer has become a gesture of solidarity in metal
                    communities—a secular equivalent to the religious gesture, meaning "we stand together" or
                    "stay strong."
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Popular Culture Symbols</h4>
                <p>
                    Beyond explicit mythological references, hammer symbolism derived from Mjolnir appears
                    throughout popular culture:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The phrase "bringing the hammer down" meaning to enforce justice or punishment</li>
                    <li>Hammer imagery in military unit insignia and symbols of strength</li>
                    <li>Sports teams named "Thunder" often incorporate hammer or lightning imagery</li>
                    <li>The hammer emoji (🔨) sometimes substitutes for Mjolnir in social media</li>
                    <li>"Thor's Hammer" as a name for powerful weapons, tools, and equipment across industries</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Theme Parks and Attractions</h4>
                <p>
                    Several theme parks feature Mjolnir-related attractions. Most notably, Disneyland and Disney
                    World include exhibitions where visitors can attempt to lift a prop Mjolnir embedded in stone,
                    with the hammer occasionally "releasing" for photos. The Isle of Arran in Scotland features a
                    "Thor's Stone" allegedly thrown by the thunder god himself.

                <p>
                    Mjolnir exists within a context of other legendary Norse weapons, each with distinct properties:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Gungnir (Odin's Spear):</strong> Forged by the same dwarves who made Sif's golden
                    hair, this spear never misses its target and always strikes with lethal force. Odin wields it
                    in his role as war god and all-father.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gram (Sigurd's Sword):</strong> Reforged from his father's broken blade, Gram could
                    cut through anvils and was used to slay the dragon Fafnir. It represents the hero's personal
                    power rather than divine authority.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tyrfing:</strong> A cursed sword that could cut through anything, never miss a
                    strike, and could not be sheathed until it had drawn blood. Unlike Mjolnir's protective role,
                    Tyrfing brought destruction to its wielders.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dainsleif (Högni's Sword):</strong> Forged by dwarves, this sword could not be
                    sheathed until it killed someone, never missed, and wounds from it never healed. A darker
                    parallel to Mjolnir's inevitable strikes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Freyr's Sword:</strong> A blade that could fight on its own, Freyr foolishly gave
                    it away for love of the giantess Gerðr. Without it, he will be defenseless at Ragnarök—
                    showing the danger of being separated from one's weapon, a fate Thor nearly suffered when
                    Thrym stole Mjolnir.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Thunder Weapons in Other Mythologies</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Zeus's Lightning Bolt (Greek):</strong> Forged by the Cyclopes, Zeus's thunderbolt
                    serves a similar function to Mjolnir—a thrown weapon that returns to its wielder and commands
                    storms. However, it's depicted as a spear or javelin rather than a hammer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Indra's Vajra (Hindu):</strong> This lightning weapon is sometimes depicted as a
                    club or mace, other times as a ritual object. Like Mjolnir, it represents divine power over
                    storms and is the primary weapon of a thunder deity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Raijin's Drums (Japanese):</strong> The Japanese thunder god creates thunder by
                    beating drums, a different approach but similar domain to Thor's hammer-created thunder.</li>
                    <li><strong>Perun's Axe (Slavic):</strong> The Slavic thunder god wielded an axe that created
                    lightning, closely paralleling Thor's role and weapon in neighboring cultures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Taranis's Wheel (Celtic):</strong> The Celtic thunder god's symbol was a solar
                    wheel, sometimes depicted as a weapon he would hurl like Thor throws Mjolnir.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Modern Fictional Weapons Inspired by Mjolnir</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Warhammer 40,000 Thunder Hammers:</strong> Massive power hammers that generate
                    energy fields, used by the Emperor's finest warriors</li>
                    <li><strong>World of Warcraft's Sulfuras:</strong> A legendary hammer that shares Mjolnir's
                    elemental properties</li>
                    <li><strong>Guild Wars 2's Mjolnir:</strong> A legendary hammer obtainable by players</li>
                    <li><strong>Dragon Age's Sulevin Blade:</strong> While a sword, it shares Mjolnir's "returning
                    to hand" property</li>
                    <li><strong>The Gravity Hammer (Halo series):</strong> A massive hammer that generates
                    shockwaves, inspired by Mjolnir's devastating impact force</li>
