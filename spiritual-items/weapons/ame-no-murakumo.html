        <!-- DESCRIPTION -->
        <div class="glass-card">
            <h3 class="section-title">Description and Appearance</h3>
            <div class="content-text">
                <p>
                    Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi (Japanese: "Grass-Cutting Sword") is one of the three Imperial
                    Regalia of Japan, sacred objects that represent the legitimate authority of the
                    Emperor and embody the divine nature of the Japanese imperial line. Along with
                    the Yata no Kagami (mirror) and Yasakani no Magatama (jewel), Kusanagi forms the
                    foundation of Japanese imperial legitimacy, connecting the Emperor to the sun
                    goddess Amaterasu and to the age of the gods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The sword's original name, Ame-no-Murakumo-no-Tsurugi ("Sword of the Gathering
                    Clouds of Heaven"), refers to the circumstances of its discovery inside the body
                    of the eight-headed serpent Yamata-no-Orochi, whose presence was said to draw
                    clouds. The more famous name Kusanagi ("Grass-Cutter") comes from the legendary
                    hero Yamato Takeru, who used the sword to cut burning grass and escape an ambush,
                    turning the flames back against his enemies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike the other Imperial Regalia, which have remained relatively secure, Kusanagi
                    has experienced a turbulent history involving theft, loss, and recovery. The sword
                    currently enshrined at Atsuta Shrine in Nagoya is considered the authentic Kusanagi,
                    though a replica is used in imperial ceremonies. As with all sacred objects in
                    Shinto tradition, the actual sword is never publicly displayed, adding to its
                    mystical aura.

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Physical Characteristics:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type:</strong> A tsurugi (double-edged straight sword), predating the
                    curved katana that became iconic of later Japanese culture. This ancient sword
                    style reflects the weapon's mythological origin</li>
                    <li><strong>Origin Material:</strong> Found within the body of the divine serpent
                    Yamata-no-Orochi, the sword may have been formed from or transformed by the
                    serpent's essence</li>
                    <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Described as having a distinctive appearance
                    worthy of divine craftsmanship, though detailed descriptions are rarely given
                    in classical sources</li>
                    <li><strong>Blade:</strong> Straight, double-edged blade capable of cutting
                    anything, from grass to enemies to the forces of nature itself</li>
                    <li><strong>Length:</strong> Traditional tsurugi length, suitable for both
                    ceremonial and combat use</li>
                    <li><strong>Current Form:</strong> The exact appearance of the modern relic is
                    unknown, as it is kept hidden from public view within multiple wrapped
                    containers at Atsuta Shrine</li>
                    <li><strong>Sacredness:</strong> Considered so holy that even the emperor
                    typically uses a replica, with the genuine article reserved for the most
                    sacred ceremonies</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="content-text">
                <p>
                    The sword's physical form has been the subject of much speculation and some
                    historical investigation. Medieval accounts describe the sword being briefly
                    glimpsed during moments of temple damage or theft, with witnesses reporting
                    a blade of unusual shape or material. However, these accounts are inconsistent
                    and potentially influenced by the expectations of observers who knew the
                    myths surrounding the weapon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1185, during the naval Battle of Dan-no-ura that concluded the Genpei War,
                    Kusanagi was reportedly lost when the child Emperor Antoku drowned along with
                    his grandmother and many court treasures. Whether the sword was recovered (as
                    some accounts claim) or whether the current relic is a replacement has been
                    debated for centuries. The Shinto priests at Atsuta maintain that the original
                    sword was never truly lost but merely went through trials that proved its
                    divine nature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What remains consistent across all accounts is the sword's numinous quality,
                    the sense that it is more than merely an object but a vessel of divine power.
                    The sword does not derive its significance from exceptional craftsmanship or
                    precious materials but from its mythological history and its role in legitimizing
                    the imperial succession. In Shinto understanding, such sacred objects (shintai)
                    serve as vessels through which kami (divine spirits) can interact with the
                    physical world.

        <!-- ORIGIN AND ACQUISITION -->
        <div class="glass-card">
            <h3 class="section-title">Origin and Mythological History</h3>
            <div class="content-text">
                <p>
                    The origin of Kusanagi is recounted in the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, the oldest
                    chronicles of Japanese history and mythology. The sword's discovery occurs during
                    one of the most dramatic episodes in Japanese mythology: the storm god Susanoo's
                    battle with the eight-headed, eight-tailed serpent Yamata-no-Orochi.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Susanoo's Exile</h4>
                <p>
                    The story begins with Susanoo-no-Mikoto, the storm god, one of the three noble
                    children born from Izanagi when he purified himself after visiting the underworld.
                    Susanoo's siblings were Amaterasu, the sun goddess, and Tsukuyomi, the moon god.
                    While his siblings took their places in heaven, Susanoo's violent and chaotic
                    nature caused trouble.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After committing various offenses against Amaterasu, including destroying her
                    rice paddies, defiling her sacred halls, and frightening her weaving maidens so
                    badly that one died, Susanoo was expelled from the heavenly realm. He descended
                    to the province of Izumo in what is now Shimane Prefecture. There, his fortunes
                    and the sword's story would intertwine.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">The Eight-Headed Serpent</h4>
                <p>
                    Wandering in Izumo, Susanoo encountered an elderly couple, Ashinazuchi and Tenazuchi,
                    weeping beside a beautiful young woman. They explained that they had originally had
                    eight daughters, but each year the terrible serpent Yamata-no-Orochi had come and
                    devoured one. Now only Kushinadahime, the youngest, remained, and the serpent would
                    soon come for her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yamata-no-Orochi was a monster of terrible power. Its body stretched across eight
                    valleys and eight hills. Its eight heads and eight tails were covered with moss
                    and trees growing from its scales. Its eyes glowed red like winter cherries. Wherever
                    it traveled, storm clouds gathered, and its body dripped with blood and corruption.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Susanoo, struck by Kushinadahime's beauty, offered to slay the serpent in exchange
                    for her hand in marriage. The parents agreed. Susanoo transformed the maiden into
                    a comb, which he placed in his hair for safekeeping. Then he set his trap.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">The Battle and Discovery</h4>
                <p>
                    Susanoo commanded the elderly couple to brew sake, refined eight times, and to
                    build a fence with eight gates, each with a platform holding a vat of the potent
                    liquor. When Yamata-no-Orochi arrived, it thrust each of its eight heads through
                    the gates and drank deeply from the vats. The serpent became drunk and fell asleep.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Susanoo attacked, using his divine sword to hack the serpent apart piece by piece.
                    The river ran red with the monster's blood. When Susanoo reached one of the tails,
                    his sword struck something hard and notched. Cutting open the tail, he discovered
                    a magnificent sword hidden within the serpent's body.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recognizing the sword's unusual nature, Susanoo named it Ame-no-Murakumo-no-Tsurugi
                    (Sword of the Gathering Clouds of Heaven), referring to the clouds that always
                    hovered over the serpent. He presented the sword to his sister Amaterasu as a
                    peace offering, reconciling their long enmity. The sword would remain in heaven
                    until given to Amaterasu's descendant who would rule the earthly realm.

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Descent to Earth</h4>
                <p>
                    When Amaterasu sent her grandson Ninigi-no-Mikoto to rule the earthly realm of
                    Japan, she gave him three treasures: the Yata no Kagami (mirror), the Yasakani
                    no Magatama (jewel), and Ame-no-Murakumo-no-Tsurugi (sword). These became the
                    Imperial Regalia, symbols of the divine mandate to rule Japan that would pass
                    to each subsequent emperor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The mirror represented Amaterasu herself and the virtue of wisdom. The jewel
                    represented benevolence. The sword represented valor and martial authority.
                    Together, the three treasures embodied the complete nature of sovereignty,
                    combining spiritual insight, compassion, and the courage to act. No emperor
                    could legitimately rule without possessing all three.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ninigi descended to earth at Takachiho in Kyushu. His great-grandson would
                    become Emperor Jimmu, the legendary first Emperor of Japan, and from him the
                    sword passed through generations until it reached the hands of the hero Yamato
                    Takeru, who would give it its famous name.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Yamato Takeru and the Grass Fire</h4>
                <p>
                    Prince Yamato Takeru, son of Emperor Keiko, was a legendary warrior whose
                    exploits helped unify Japan under imperial rule. Before embarking on a campaign
                    to subdue the eastern barbarians, he visited his aunt Yamato-hime-no-mikoto,
                    the high priestess of Ise Grand Shrine, who gave him the sacred sword.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During his campaign, Yamato Takeru's enemies in Suruga Province lured him into
                    a grass-covered plain and set the field ablaze while simultaneously attacking
                    with superior numbers. Surrounded by fire with no escape, death seemed certain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In desperation, Yamato Takeru drew the sacred sword. As he did, he discovered
                    that it could control the wind. He used the sword to cut the burning grass
                    around him while redirecting the wind to turn the flames against his attackers.
                    The ambushers were consumed by their own fire, and Yamato Takeru emerged
                    victorious. From that day, the sword was called Kusanagi, "Grass-Cutter."

            <div class="content-text">
                <p>
                    Kusanagi possesses supernatural powers befitting its divine origin and its status
                    as one of the three objects connecting Japan's emperors to the kami. Unlike some
                    legendary weapons whose powers are primarily martial, Kusanagi's abilities
                    encompass elements of nature, spiritual authority, and symbolic governance.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="power-list">
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Wind Control</strong>
                    Kusanagi's most famous power is control over wind. Yamato Takeru used this
                    ability to redirect flames during his ambush. The sword can summon gusts,
                    control their direction, and potentially create more powerful wind phenomena.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Imperial Legitimacy</strong>
                    Possession of Kusanagi (along with the mirror and jewel) confirms the legitimate
                    right to rule Japan. This spiritual power is perhaps the sword's most significant
                    attribute, making it irreplaceable to the imperial institution.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Divine Protection</strong>
                    As a shintai (vessel of divine spirit), Kusanagi protects its rightful possessor.
                    Yamato Takeru survived numerous dangers while carrying the sword, suggesting it
                    provides divine favor and protection.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Cutting Power</strong>
                    The sword's basic function as a weapon is enhanced to supernatural levels. It
                    cut through the great serpent Orochi and can cut grass, fire, and presumably
                    any physical obstacle.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Connection to Amaterasu</strong>
                    As Amaterasu's gift to the imperial line, the sword maintains a connection to
                    the sun goddess. This link to the chief kami of Shinto reinforces the sacred
                    nature of imperial rule.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Serpent Nature</strong>
                    Having emerged from Yamata-no-Orochi's body, the sword may retain some connection
                    to serpent/dragon spirits and their associations with water, storms, and transformation.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Weather Influence</strong>
                    Beyond wind specifically, Kusanagi may influence weather more broadly. Its original
                    name references the gathering of clouds, and storms surrounded the serpent from
                    which it came.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Self-Preservation</strong>
                    Some traditions hold that the sword has the power to protect itself, returning
                    when stolen or surviving disasters that would destroy ordinary objects. Its
                    alleged recovery from the sea after Dan-no-ura supports this belief.

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Symbolic Functions</h4>
                <p>
                    Beyond its supernatural abilities, Kusanagi serves important symbolic functions:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Martial Virtue:</strong> Among the three regalia, the sword represents
                    the military aspect of rule, the emperor's role as commander and protector</li>
                    <li><strong>Valor:</strong> The sword symbolizes courage and the willingness to
                    defend the nation and its people from threats</li>
                    <li><strong>Divine Descent:</strong> As a gift from heaven passed down through
                    generations, the sword proves the emperor's descent from Amaterasu</li>
                    <li><strong>Unity:</strong> The sword's journey through Japan with Yamato Takeru
                    represents the unification of the nation under imperial rule</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Limitations and Conditions</h4>
                <p>
                    Kusanagi's power appears conditional on proper relationship with the imperial
                    line and the kami. When the sword was lost at Dan-no-ura, it was in the
                    possession of a child emperor fleeing defeat, not in active use by a legitimate
                    ruler on the throne. Some interpretations suggest the sword chose to return to
                    the sea (returning toward its serpent origins) rather than fall into rebel hands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The sword's powers also seem to require wielding by the worthy. Yamato Takeru
                    could use its wind power because of his heroic nature and imperial blood.
                    Whether others could access these powers remains unclear from the mythology.

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Susanoo-no-Mikoto</h4>
                <p>
                    Susanoo, the storm god, is Kusanagi's first known possessor. His character
                    combines violence with heroism: expelled from heaven for his destructive
                    behavior, he redeems himself by slaying Yamata-no-Orochi and presenting the
                    sword to Amaterasu. Susanoo represents the raw, chaotic forces of nature that
                    must be channeled toward protective rather than destructive ends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His discovery of the sword within the serpent's body suggests a theme of
                    treasure hidden within monsters, of good emerging from evil, of divine purpose
                    working through unlikely circumstances. The sword was always destined for the
                    imperial line, but it required Susanoo's violence to free it from its serpentine prison.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Amaterasu-Omikami</h4>
                <p>
                    The sun goddess Amaterasu is the chief kami of Shinto and the divine ancestor
                    of the Japanese imperial family. She received Kusanagi from her brother Susanoo
                    and later gave it to her grandson Ninigi when he descended to rule the earth.
                    The sword's passage through Amaterasu connects it to the highest divine authority.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Amaterasu's acceptance of the sword from Susanoo represented reconciliation
                    between the estranged siblings. The sword thus carries associations with peace
                    and reconciliation as well as martial valor. It is a gift that heals family
                    division and establishes proper order.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Yamato Takeru</h4>
                <p>
                    Yamato Takeru (meaning "Brave of Yamato") is the most famous human wielder of
                    Kusanagi. His story combines tragedy with heroism. Sent on dangerous campaigns
                    by a father who may have feared his abilities, Yamato Takeru conquered the
                    enemies of the imperial court across Japan but never received proper recognition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His relationship with Kusanagi reveals the sword's character. When he left the
                    sword with his wife Miyazu-hime before venturing to defeat a deity on Mount Ibuki,
                    he was struck down and eventually died. The sword that had protected him in so
                    many dangers could not save him when left behind. This suggests the sword rewards
                    those who trust in it but cannot help those who abandon it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Upon Yamato Takeru's death, he transformed into a white bird and flew away. The
                    legend captures Japanese cultural attitudes toward heroic sacrifice and the
                    transcendence available even to those who die tragically. Miyazu-hime enshrined
                    Kusanagi at Atsuta, where it has remained (with some interruptions) ever since.

                <p><strong>Discovery in Orochi</strong></p>
                <p>
                    When Susanoo's sword notched against something hard within the serpent's tail,
                    he knew he had found something extraordinary. The sword hidden within the monster
                    became the prize that redeemed Susanoo's exile from heaven.
                </p>

                <p><strong>The Gift to Amaterasu</strong></p>
                <p>
                    By presenting the sword to his sister, Susanoo transformed his act of violence
                    into an offering of peace. The sword became a token of reconciliation between
                    storm and sun, chaos and order.
                </p>

                <p><strong>The Descent with Ninigi</strong></p>
                <p>
                    When Ninigi descended to rule the land of Japan, he brought the three regalia
                    as proof of his divine mandate. The sword thus began its role as guarantor of
                    imperial legitimacy.
                </p>

                <p><strong>The Grass Fire</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Yamato Takeru's use of the sword to control wind and defeat his ambushers
                    revealed powers beyond mere cutting. The sword received its famous name
                    Kusanagi from this episode.

                <p>
                    Yamato Takeru's death without the sword demonstrated both the weapon's
                    protective power (which he lacked when he left it behind) and its limitations
                    (it could not save him across distance).

                    the regalia. The mirror and jewel were recovered, but Kusanagi was said to be
                    lost. Whether it was truly lost or secretly recovered remains debated.

            <div class="content-text">
                <h4 class="subsection-title">Imperial Legitimacy</h4>
                <p>
                    Kusanagi's primary significance lies in its role legitimizing the Japanese
                    emperor. The divine origin of the imperial family, descending from Amaterasu
                    through an unbroken line, is materially represented by the three regalia.
                    Without these objects, especially the sword representing martial authority,
                    an emperor's claim would lack its divine foundation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This symbolism has made Kusanagi politically significant throughout Japanese
                    history. During civil wars and succession disputes, control of the regalia
                    determined which claimant could legitimately be considered emperor. The Southern
                    Court during the Nanboku-cho period (1336-1392) claimed legitimacy partly through
                    possession of the regalia, while the Northern Court ruled with replicas.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Martial Virtue (Bu)</h4>
                <p>
                    Among the three regalia, Kusanagi specifically represents bu, martial virtue or
                    valor. Japanese culture has long balanced bu (martial) with bun (cultural/civil)
                    aspects of governance. The emperor must embody both, using force when necessary
                    to protect the nation but preferring peace and civilization when possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The sword's association with Yamato Takeru reinforces this martial symbolism.
                    Yamato Takeru's campaigns unified Japan under imperial rule, using violence in
                    service of order. The sword represents this necessary violence, the willingness
                    to fight for just causes.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Serpent and Storm</h4>
                <p>
                    Kusanagi's origin in Yamata-no-Orochi connects it to serpent/dragon symbolism
                    prevalent across East Asian cultures. Serpents and dragons represent water,
                    storms, natural power, and transformation. The sword emerging from the serpent
                    suggests the taming of chaotic natural forces for human benefit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The storm god Susanoo's role in the story reinforces these associations. Storm
                    destroys the destructive serpent, and from destruction emerges creation (the
                    sword). This pattern reflects natural cycles of destruction and renewal central
                    to Japanese spirituality.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Hidden Sacredness</h4>
                <p>
                    The fact that Kusanagi is never publicly displayed reflects important Shinto
                    concepts about sacred objects. The holiest things must be hidden, wrapped,
                    protected from profane sight. The mysterious, unseen nature of the sword
                    enhances rather than diminishes its power. Faith does not require visual
                    confirmation; indeed, the unseen is often more powerful than the seen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This hiddenness also protects the sacred mystery. If Kusanagi were displayed
                    and examined, it might prove to be merely an ancient sword, disappointing
                    those who expect supernatural radiance. By remaining hidden, it remains
                    whatever the faithful imagine it to be, transcending physical limitations.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">National Identity</h4>
                <p>
                    Kusanagi contributes to Japanese national identity by representing the mythological
                    foundation of the nation. The sword's journey across Japan with Yamato Takeru
                    mirrors the unification of diverse regions into a single nation. Its ultimate
                    home at Atsuta Shrine makes that location a center of national spiritual significance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During Japan's imperial period (especially 1868-1945), the regalia were heavily
                    emphasized as symbols of Japan's unique divine heritage. While post-war Japan
                    has deemphasized these aspects, the regalia remain important for imperial
                    ceremonies and for many Japanese as symbols of cultural continuity.
