            <div class="content-text">
                <p>
                    The Pashupatastra (Sanskrit: "Weapon of Pashupati") is considered the most devastating weapon
                    in Hindu mythology, surpassing even the Brahmastra in destructive potential. As the personal
                    weapon of Lord Shiva in his aspect as Pashupati ("Lord of Animals" or "Lord of All Beings"),
                    this astra embodies the god's role as the destroyer in the Hindu trinity. When unleashed, it
                    can annihilate anything in creation - gods, demons, humans, or the universe itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike other divine weapons that can be countered by equal or superior armaments, the
                    Pashupatastra has no defense. It cannot be stopped, recalled (by anyone except the original
                    user), or neutralized. Once invoked, it will fulfill its purpose absolutely. This makes it
                    not merely a powerful weapon but the ultimate expression of Shiva's authority over existence
                    and non-existence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The weapon exists in an unusual category among astras. While most divine missiles require
                    physical arrows or implements as carriers, the Pashupatastra can be invoked through the mind,
                    eyes, words, or a physical bow. It transcends the normal rules of astra deployment, reflecting
                    Shiva's nature as the god who transcends all limitations.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4 class="subsection-title">Deployment Methods:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>By Mind (Manas):</strong> Mental invocation, the most powerful form</li>
                    <li><strong>By Eye (Chakshu):</strong> Through divine gaze</li>
                    <li><strong>By Word (Vak):</strong> Through spoken mantra</li>
                    <li><strong>By Bow (Dhanush):</strong> Conventional arrow deployment</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>Note:</strong> Each successive method is less powerful than the previous, but all
                    are sufficient to destroy any target.

        <!-- ORIGIN MYTH -->
        <div class="glass-card">
            <h3 class="section-title">Origin and Mythology</h3>
            <div class="content-text">
                <h4 class="subsection-title">The Weapon of the Destroyer</h4>
                <p>
                    The Pashupatastra is intrinsically linked to Shiva's cosmic role as the destroyer. In Hindu
                    cosmology, the universe undergoes endless cycles of creation (by Brahma), preservation (by
                    Vishnu), and destruction (by Shiva). The Pashupatastra represents Shiva's destructive power
                    in weaponized form - the force that will ultimately dissolve all creation at the end of
                    each cosmic cycle (pralaya).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The name "Pashupati" carries multiple meanings. While commonly translated as "Lord of
                    Animals," it more accurately means "Lord of All Beings" (pashu = living beings, pati = lord).
                    In this context, it refers to Shiva's sovereignty over all souls. The weapon that bears this
                    name thus represents authority over life and death for all creatures.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Arjuna's Quest for the Pashupatastra</h4>
                <p>
                    The most detailed account of the Pashupatastra's transmission appears in the Mahabharata,
                    during the Pandavas' exile. Recognizing that the coming Kurukshetra War would require divine
                    weapons to defeat enemies like Bhishma, Drona, and Karna, Arjuna undertook a pilgrimage to
                    obtain celestial armaments from the gods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Arjuna traveled to the Himalayas and performed intense tapasya (austerities) to attract
                    Shiva's attention. During this period, a demon named Muka, in the form of a wild boar,
                    attacked Arjuna. Simultaneously, a Kirata (mountain hunter) appeared and also shot at the
                    boar. A dispute arose over who had killed the beast.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Kirata challenged Arjuna to combat. Despite being the greatest archer alive, Arjuna
                    found himself unable to defeat this mysterious hunter. His arrows had no effect; his bow
                    shattered; even hand-to-hand combat proved futile. Finally, Arjuna recognized his opponent
                    as Shiva himself and fell at his feet in worship.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "Pleased with your valor, O Partha, and your unwavering spirit in combat, I grant you the
                Pashupatastra. But know this - it must never be used against inferior foes. To deploy it
                against those unworthy would destroy the three worlds."
                <br><br>- Lord Shiva to Arjuna, Mahabharata
            </div>

            <div class="content-text">
                <p>
                    Pleased by Arjuna's courage (for fighting against what he suspected was a divine being)
                    and his devotion (for immediately recognizing and worshipping Shiva), the god revealed his
                    true form. Shiva restored Arjuna's weapons and healed his wounds before bestowing upon him
                    the Pashupatastra with strict instructions about its use.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">The Restrictions</h4>
                <p>
                    Shiva imposed crucial limitations on the weapon's use. The Pashupatastra could never be
                    employed against inferior enemies - those unworthy of such overwhelming force. To use it
                    disproportionately would be adharmic (against cosmic law) and might trigger catastrophic
                    consequences, potentially destroying the universe prematurely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Arjuna accepted these conditions and received the knowledge to invoke the weapon. However,
                    throughout the Kurukshetra War, he never actually used it. Even against the most formidable
                    enemies - Bhishma, Drona, Karna - Arjuna relied on other weapons. The Pashupatastra remained
                    the ultimate reserve, never deployed because no situation truly warranted universal
                    annihilation.

                    <strong>Universal Destruction</strong>
                    The Pashupatastra can destroy anything in creation - individual beings, armies, cities,
                    mountains, worlds, or the entire universe. No target is beyond its capacity.

                    divine missiles that can be countered, this weapon acknowledges no defense.

                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Multi-Modal Deployment</strong>
                    Can be invoked through mind, eyes, words, or conventional bow, giving the wielder
                    flexibility in combat situations.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Selective Destruction</strong>
                    Despite its overwhelming power, the weapon can be aimed at specific targets without
                    necessarily destroying everything in its path - though careless use could trigger
                    universal annihilation.

                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Anti-Divine Capability</strong>
                    Can destroy gods, demons, and other supernatural beings that might be immune to
                    lesser weapons. Even Vishnu or Brahma could theoretically be harmed by it.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Recall Limitation</strong>
                    Once released, only the person who deployed it can recall the Pashupatastra. If the
                    wielder dies or becomes incapacitated, the weapon will fulfill its programming
                    regardless of consequences.

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Indrajit (Meghnad)</h4>
                <p>
                    In the Ramayana, Indrajit (also called Meghnad), the son of Ravana, possessed the
                    Pashupatastra. He obtained it through intense devotion to Shiva and used it to devastating
                    effect against Rama's army. Indrajit's possession of this weapon made him one of the most
                    dangerous adversaries Rama ever faced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Indrajit used the Pashupatastra to apparently "kill" both Rama and Lakshmana during the
                    war for Lanka. They were only revived through divine intervention and the magical herb
                    Sanjeevani brought by Hanuman. This demonstrated both the weapon's power and its
                    limitations - even it could not permanently destroy avatars of Vishnu.

                    <li><strong>Bhishma:</strong> Some traditions suggest the grandsire possessed knowledge

                    invocation but chose not to teach it</li>
                    <li><strong>Various Asuras:</strong> Through devotion, certain demons gained this power,

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Shiva's Destructive Aspect</h4>
                <p>
                    The Pashupatastra symbolizes the necessary role of destruction in cosmic maintenance.
                    In Hindu philosophy, destruction is not evil but essential - old forms must be dissolved
                    to make way for new creation. The weapon represents this principle in its most concentrated
                    form.

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Power and Responsibility</h4>
                <p>
                    The strict limitations on the Pashupatastra's use emphasize that ultimate power carries
                    ultimate responsibility. Arjuna's possession of the weapon alongside his restraint in
                    using it illustrates the dharmic principle that true strength lies not in destruction
                    but in controlled power.

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Devotion and Grace</h4>
                <p>
                    Both Arjuna and Indrajit obtained the Pashupatastra through devotion to Shiva, demonstrating
                    that divine weapons are earned through spiritual merit, not merely martial skill. The
                    weapon becomes a symbol of the rewards that devoted worship can bring.
