                <p>
                    Fragarach (Old Irish: "The Answerer" or "The Retaliator"), also known as Freagarthach or the
                    Sword of Air, stands among the most legendary weapons in Celtic mythology. This magical blade
                    belonged to Manannan mac Lir, the sea god and ruler of the Otherworld island of Tir na nOg,
                    before being passed to Lugh Lamhfada, the master of all arts and champion of the Tuatha De Danann.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The sword's name derives from its most distinctive power: when pointed at someone's throat,
                    Fragarach compelled absolute truth from the victim. No lie could be spoken while under its
                    influence, and no question could be evaded. This made Fragarach not merely a weapon of war
                    but an instrument of divine justice, capable of settling disputes, uncovering treachery, and
                    ensuring that oaths were honored.

                    Fragarach was one of the Four Treasures of the Tuatha De Danann, the divine race that ruled
                    Ireland before the coming of the Milesians. These treasures - the Stone of Fal, the Spear of
                    Lugh, the Cauldron of the Dagda, and Fragarach - were brought from the four mystical cities
                    of the north: Falias, Gorias, Finias, and Murias. Each treasure embodied a fundamental aspect
                    of sovereignty and divine power.

        <div class="glass-card">
            <h3 class="section-title">Origin and History</h3>
            <div class="content-text">
                <h4 class="subsection-title">Forging in the Otherworld</h4>
                <p>
                    According to the oldest traditions, Fragarach was forged by the gods themselves in one of the
                    four mystical cities - specifically Findias (or Finias) - before the Tuatha De Danann descended
                    upon Ireland. The smith who created it was said to have captured the essence of the winds in
                    the blade, giving it power over the element of air itself. The metal was quenched in sacred
                    waters and blessed with enchantments that would never fade.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Manannan mac Lir, as lord of the Otherworld and guardian of the passages between realms,
                    became the sword's first wielder among the gods. He used Fragarach to defend the borders
                    between the mortal world and the realms beyond, ensuring that neither the living nor the
                    dead could pass without proper authority.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Transfer to Lugh</h4>
                <p>
                    When Lugh Lamhfada - the young god who mastered every art and craft - came to take his place
                    among the Tuatha De Danann, Manannan bestowed upon him several gifts essential for the coming
                    battle against the Fomorians. Among these was Fragarach, which Lugh would wield alongside
                    his famous spear in the Second Battle of Mag Tuired.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In that great conflict, Lugh used Fragarach to devastating effect against the Fomorian
                    champions. The sword's power to cut through any armor negated the magical protections that
                    many Fomorian warriors relied upon, while its truth-compelling properties helped Lugh
                    identify traitors and ensure the loyalty of his forces.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Legacy Through the Ages</h4>
                <p>
                    After the age of the Tuatha De Danann, Fragarach passed through various hands. Some
                    traditions claim it was eventually wielded by Conn of the Hundred Battles, the legendary
                    High King of Ireland, and later by his descendants. The sword became associated with
                    legitimate kingship - only a true ruler, chosen by the gods, could wield Fragarach
                    without being harmed by its power.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "No one could tell a lie with Fragarach at his throat, no armor could stand before its edge,
                and the wind itself obeyed the one who bore it."

            <div class="content-text">
                <p>
                    Fragarach possessed multiple magical abilities that made it one of the most formidable
                    weapons in all of Celtic mythology. Its powers combined martial supremacy with supernatural
                    authority over truth, wind, and the very nature of combat itself.

                    <strong>Truth Compulsion</strong>
                    The sword's signature ability - when Fragarach was placed against anyone's throat, they
                    were incapable of speaking falsehood. Every question had to be answered truthfully, making
                    the sword invaluable for interrogations, trials, and the settling of disputes. This power
                    worked on mortal, god, and spirit alike.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Armor Piercing</strong>
                    No shield, armor, or magical protection could withstand Fragarach's edge. The blade passed
                    through any defense as if it were not there, making its strikes absolutely lethal regardless
                    of what protections an enemy might possess.

                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Wind Command</strong>
                    As the "Sword of Air," Fragarach granted its wielder control over the winds. The bearer
                    could summon gales, redirect storms, or create zones of absolute stillness. In naval
                    combat, this made the sword's wielder virtually unstoppable.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>The Final Retort</strong>
                    The name "Answerer" also referred to the sword's ability to strike the killing blow in
                    any combat. When wielded righteously, Fragarach ensured that its bearer would always
                    have the "last word" in battle - the final, decisive strike that ended the conflict.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Wound Infliction</strong>
                    Wounds caused by Fragarach could not be healed through normal means or conventional
                    magic. Only the most powerful healing arts or the blessing of a god could close injuries
                    made by this blade.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Loyalty to Righteousness</strong>
                    Fragarach could not be used for unjust purposes. If its wielder attempted to use the
                    sword for evil or to enforce lies rather than truth, the blade would turn against them,
                    refusing to cut or even burning their hand with its touch.

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Manannan mac Lir</h4>
                <p>
                    The sea god and ruler of the Otherworld was Fragarach's original wielder. Manannan is one of
                    the most complex figures in Celtic mythology - simultaneously a god of the sea, a psychopomp
                    who guides souls to the afterlife, a trickster, and a guardian of the boundaries between
                    worlds. His possession of Fragarach symbolized his role as the keeper of cosmic order and
                    the one who ensures that truth prevails over deception.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Manannan's other famous possessions included his crane bag (containing magical treasures),
                    his horse Enbarr that could travel over sea as easily as land, and his ship Wave Sweeper
                    that needed no sails or oars. Together with Fragarach, these items marked him as master of
                    all the liminal spaces - sea, air, and the threshold between life and death.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Lugh Lamhfada</h4>
                <p>
                    Lugh "of the Long Arm" was the champion of the Tuatha De Danann and one of the greatest
                    figures in Irish mythology. He was the master of every skill and craft - warrior, king,
                    poet, harper, smith, sorcerer, and more. When Lugh arrived at the court of King Nuada to
                    join the Tuatha De Danann, he demonstrated mastery of every art, earning him the title
                    "Samildanach" (Equally Skilled in All Arts).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fragarach complemented Lugh's other weapons - his famous spear Gae Assail and his sling
                    with which he slew Balor of the Evil Eye. Together, these weapons made Lugh virtually
                    invincible and enabled him to lead the Tuatha De Danann to victory in their greatest battles.

            <div class="content-text">
                <h4 class="subsection-title">Symbol of Justice</h4>
                <p>
                    Fragarach's truth-compelling power made it a symbol of divine justice in Celtic thought.
                    The concept that truth could be enforced by divine power reflected the Celtic belief that
                    cosmic order depended on honesty and the keeping of oaths. In a society where verbal
                    contracts and sworn agreements formed the basis of law, a weapon that guaranteed truth
                    represented the ultimate legal authority.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">The Four Treasures</h4>
                <p>
                    As one of the Four Treasures of the Tuatha De Danann, Fragarach represented one of the
                    four essential aspects of legitimate rule:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Stone of Fal:</strong> Confirmed the true king by crying out</li>
                    <li><strong>The Spear of Lugh:</strong> Guaranteed victory in battle</li>
                    <li><strong>The Cauldron of the Dagda:</strong> Provided endless sustenance</li>
                    <li><strong>Fragarach:</strong> Ensured justice and truth</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Together, these treasures embodied the requirements of Celtic kingship: divine selection,
                    military prowess, abundance for the people, and just rule.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Elemental Association</h4>
                <p>
                    The Four Treasures were associated with the four classical elements, with Fragarach
                    representing Air. This connection to the element of air manifested in the sword's power
                    over wind but also in deeper symbolic meanings - air represents breath, speech, and truth.
                    The sword of air was thus naturally the sword of truth-telling.

                    <li><strong>Jim Butcher's "Dresden Files":</strong> Features Fragarach as a significant

                    <li><strong>Various RPGs:</strong> Celtic-themed games often include the Four Treasures</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Cultural Impact</h4>
                <p>
                    The concept of a "sword of truth" has influenced countless fantasy works, with Fragarach
                    serving as one of the primary mythological sources for truth-compelling magical weapons.
                    The idea that a blade could enforce honesty speaks to deep human desires for justice and
                    the exposure of deception.
