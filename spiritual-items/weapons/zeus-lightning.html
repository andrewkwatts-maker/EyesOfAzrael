            <div class="content-text">
                <p>
                    The lightning bolt of Zeus (called keraunos in Greek, fulmen in Latin) is the most iconic weapon
                    in Greek mythology and the supreme symbol of divine power. As the weapon of Zeus, king of the
                    gods and ruler of the sky, the thunderbolt represents the ultimate authority in the cosmos—the
                    power to destroy utterly, to judge from on high, and to enforce the will of the divine order
                    against all opposition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike earthly weapons forged from metal and wielded by mortal strength, Zeus's lightning bolt
                    is a manifestation of celestial power itself—the raw energy of the storm made tangible and
                    directed by divine will. It embodies the terrifying majesty of nature's most powerful force,
                    transformed into an instrument of justice, vengeance, and sovereign authority.

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Physical Characteristics:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Form:</strong> Typically depicted as a zigzag shaft of brilliant light, often with
                    a central rod and radiating prongs or flames, though some ancient art shows it as a spear or
                    javelin with flame-like projections</li>
                    <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Blazing with blinding white or golden light, crackling with
                    electrical energy, sometimes wreathed in flames or dark storm clouds</li>
                    <li><strong>Sound:</strong> Accompanied by deafening thunder when thrown or wielded, the very
                    sound of Zeus's voice made manifest</li>
                    <li><strong>Variants:</strong> Zeus possessed multiple thunderbolts, not just one, stored in
                    his armory on Mount Olympus and carried to him by his eagle when needed</li>
                    <li><strong>Weight:</strong> Weightless to Zeus but impossibly heavy to others; only the king
                    of gods could wield it without being destroyed by its power</li>
                    <li><strong>Artistic Depictions:</strong> Ancient Greek art shows various forms—sometimes a
                    three-pronged or four-pronged fork of lightning, other times a flaming spear, occasionally a
                    diamond-shaped double-ended weapon</li>
                    <li><strong>Aftermath:</strong> Where Zeus's thunderbolt strikes, it leaves scorched earth,
                    shattered stone, and sometimes a permanently charged or cursed site</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="content-text">
                <p>
                    The visual representation of Zeus's lightning bolt evolved throughout Greek and Roman periods.
                    Early archaic art often showed it as a simple forked bolt or as a bundle of flames. Classical
                    period art refined it into the distinctive zigzag form familiar today. Roman depictions under
                    the name of Jupiter sometimes emphasized its spear-like qualities, associating it with military
                    authority and imperial power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ancient texts describe the thunderbolt as having different types or intensities. Some struck
                    with pure destruction, annihilating the target completely. Others served as warnings, striking
                    near but not upon the intended recipient. Still others possessed the power to transform or
                    immortalize, as when Zeus used lightning to bring Semele's premature child (Dionysus) to term
                    in his own thigh after she was burned to death by his divine radiance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The weapon's dual nature—both destroyer and symbol of sovereignty—made it essential to
                    understanding Zeus's character. He was not merely a warrior god but the embodiment of cosmic
                    order, and his lightning bolt served as both executioner's axe and king's scepter, punishing
                    those who violated natural law while establishing and maintaining the hierarchy of the universe.

            <div class="content-text">
                <p>
                    The creation of Zeus's thunderbolt is intimately tied to the Titanomachy—the great war between
                    the Olympian gods led by Zeus and the Titans led by Kronos (Saturn). This conflict determined
                    who would rule the cosmos, and the thunderbolt was the weapon that ultimately secured Zeus's
                    victory and established the Olympian order.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">The Cyclopes - Master Craftsmen</h4>
                <p>
                    The thunderbolt was forged by the Cyclopes—three one-eyed giant brothers named Brontes (Thunder),
                    Steropes (Lightning), and Arges (Bright). These primordial beings were sons of Uranus (Sky) and
                    Gaia (Earth), making them members of the earliest generation of divine entities, older even than
                    the Titans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Cyclopes possessed unique knowledge of metalworking and elemental forces. Their single eye,
                    according to some interpretations, allowed them to see into the heart of matter itself, to
                    understand the fundamental forces of nature and bend them to creative purposes. They were not
                    merely smiths but cosmic engineers, capable of working with forces that would destroy lesser
                    beings even to approach.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kronos, fearing the power of the Cyclopes, had imprisoned them in Tartarus—the deepest pit of
                    the underworld, far below even Hades' realm. There they remained for ages, chained in darkness,
                    their creative genius wasted in confinement.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Liberation and the Forging</h4>
                <p>
                    When Zeus and his siblings (Poseidon, Hades, Hera, Demeter, and Hestia) rose in rebellion
                    against their father Kronos, they faced a dire military situation. The Titans were powerful,
                    experienced in war, and had ruled the cosmos for ages. The young Olympians needed weapons
                    capable of challenging such overwhelming force.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gaia, the Earth herself, advised Zeus to descend into Tartarus and free the Cyclopes. Zeus,
                    demonstrating the wisdom that would characterize his rule, recognized that mercy and alliance
                    would serve him better than cruelty and domination. He broke the chains that bound the Cyclopes,
                    liberating them from their long torment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In gratitude and recognition of Zeus's kingship-to-be, the Cyclopes set to work creating weapons
                    for the three brothers who would divide rulership of the cosmos. They labored in their cosmic
                    forge, working with materials and forces beyond mortal comprehension.

                <h4 class="subsection-title">The Three Divine Weapons</h4>
                <p>
                    The Cyclopes forged three supreme weapons, one for each of the three brothers who would rule
                    the divided cosmos:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>For Zeus:</strong> The thunderbolt, representing mastery of the sky and the ultimate
                    destructive power, marking him as king of gods and men</li>
                    <li><strong>For Poseidon:</strong> The trident, granting control over earthquakes and all waters,
                    establishing his dominion over the seas</li>
                    <li><strong>For Hades:</strong> The helm of darkness (Kunee Aïdos), which granted invisibility,
                    appropriate for the lord of the unseen realm of death</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These three weapons formed a complete set of cosmic authority—Zeus commanded the heavens and
                    air, Poseidon the seas and earth, Hades the underworld and death. Together, they represented
                    total dominion over all aspects of existence.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">The Nature of the Forging</h4>
                <p>
                    The exact process of creating the thunderbolt remains mysterious even in ancient sources. Some
                    traditions suggest the Cyclopes gathered the raw power of celestial fire from the upper
                    atmosphere, condensing and shaping it into weaponized form. Others propose they forged it from
                    metals found only in meteorites—sky-metal fallen from the heavens themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Still other accounts suggest the thunderbolt was not created ex nihilo but rather captured and
                    refined from the primordial chaos that existed before the ordered cosmos. The Cyclopes would
                    have channeled this pre-cosmic energy into a stable form that Zeus could wield without being
                    consumed by it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What seems certain is that the thunderbolt represents raw cosmic power given shape and purpose.
                    It is not merely a weapon but the authority to unmake what has been made, to reduce order to
                    chaos, and thereby to enforce the will of the supreme deity. In this sense, the thunderbolt is
                    the ultimate trump card in any conflict—the option of complete destruction that makes all other
                    powers subordinate to Zeus.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Victory in the Titanomachy</h4>
                <p>
                    Armed with the thunderbolt, Zeus led the Olympians to victory over the Titans. The weapon proved
                    decisive in battle after battle, as no Titan could withstand its power. Zeus hurled thunderbolts
                    that shook the foundations of the world, split mountains, and hurled enemies into Tartarus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The war lasted ten years, but with the thunderbolt, Zeus ultimately prevailed. He cast down
                    Kronos and most of the Titans into Tartarus, established the Olympian order, and took his place
                    as king of gods and mortals. The thunderbolt thus became not just a weapon but the symbol of
                    legitimate divine authority—the tool by which the current cosmic order was established and would
                    be maintained.

            <div class="content-text">
                <p>
                    Zeus's thunderbolt is perhaps the most straightforwardly destructive weapon in any mythology.
                    While other divine weapons possess subtlety or multiple functions, the lightning bolt's primary
                    purpose is absolute annihilation. However, its powers extend beyond mere destruction to encompass
                    authority, judgment, and control over natural forces.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="power-list">
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Complete Destruction</strong>
                    The thunderbolt can utterly annihilate any target, reducing gods, monsters, or mortals to ash
                    in an instant. Nothing can withstand a direct strike from Zeus's full power. Even immortal
                    beings can be cast down or grievously wounded by its force.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Infinite Range</strong>
                    Zeus can hurl his thunderbolt from Mount Olympus and strike any target anywhere in the world,
                    or even in the underworld or on the edge of the cosmos. Distance provides no protection from
                    the Sky Father's wrath.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Perfect Accuracy</strong>
                    Like other supreme divine weapons, Zeus's thunderbolt never misses its intended target. Whether
                    aimed at a specific person in a crowd or a ship on the distant sea, the bolt strikes precisely
                    where Zeus wills it.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Weather Control</strong>
                    The thunderbolt serves as the focus and symbol of Zeus's authority over weather and storms.
                    Through it, he commands thunder, lightning, rain, wind, and all atmospheric phenomena. The
                    weapon doesn't just create isolated strikes but can generate entire tempests.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Divine Judgment</strong>
                    When Zeus uses the thunderbolt to strike someone down, it serves as both execution and verdict.
                    The bolt's strike declares divine judgment on the target, marking them as guilty of offending
                    cosmic order. This makes the weapon an instrument of justice, not mere violence.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Fear and Awe</strong>
                    The mere sight of Zeus wielding the thunderbolt, or the sound of thunder announcing his
                    presence, strikes terror into hearts and compels submission. Even other gods show deference
                    when Zeus raises the bolt in warning.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Immortal-Slaying</strong>
                    While gods cannot truly die, Zeus's thunderbolt can incapacitate, wound, or cast them into
                    imprisonment. It can strip immortals of their divine positions or hurl them from Olympus. In
                    this way, it represents power over even divine beings.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Transformative Power</strong>
                    In rare cases, the thunderbolt's power can transform rather than destroy. Zeus has used
                    lightning to immortalize mortals, to alter forms, or to burn away mortal elements leaving only
                    the divine essence (as with Dionysus after Semele's death).
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Earthquake Generation</strong>
                    When Zeus strikes the earth with his thunderbolt, it can create earthquakes and split the
                    ground, though this overlaps with Poseidon's domain as the Earth-Shaker. The weapon's impact
                    affects not just the immediate target but the surrounding landscape.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Light and Revelation</strong>
                    The thunderbolt's brilliant flash can illuminate hidden things, revealing truth and exposing
                    secrets. Zeus used this aspect when judging between gods or mortals, as nothing can remain
                    concealed in the lightning's glare.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Sacred Sites</strong>
                    Places struck by Zeus's thunderbolt became sacred, often marked with shrines or temples.
                    The Greeks believed such spots retained divine power and were connected to Zeus himself. They
                    were considered both blessed and dangerous.
                </div>
                <div class="power-item">
                    <strong>Inexhaustible Supply</strong>
                    Zeus never runs out of thunderbolts. His eagle continually brings him fresh bolts from his
                    armory on Olympus, and he can generate new ones from the storm itself. This endless arsenal
                    means Zeus can rain destruction without limit if sufficiently provoked.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="content-text">
                <h4 class="subsection-title">Limitations and Restraint</h4>
                <p>
                    Despite its overwhelming power, Zeus does not use the thunderbolt casually or without thought.
                    The weapon represents ultimate force, and its use carries implications for cosmic order. Zeus
                    learned, sometimes through hard experience, that absolute power must be tempered with wisdom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Certain beings and objects could provide limited protection against the thunderbolt. The aegis
                    (Zeus's shield, sometimes borne by Athena) could deflect or absorb some of its power. Heroes
                    under divine protection might survive indirect strikes, though direct hits remained invariably
                    fatal to mortals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, Zeus's use of the thunderbolt was constrained by fate (Moira) and by political
                    considerations among the gods. Striking down other Olympians would create diplomatic crises and
                    potential rebellion. The thunderbolt gave Zeus supremacy but not unlimited license—even the
                    mightiest weapon cannot overturn fundamental cosmic law or destiny.

            <div class="content-text">
                <h4 class="subsection-title">Zeus - King of the Gods</h4>
                <p>
                    Zeus (Roman name: Jupiter, Jove) is the supreme deity of the Greek pantheon, ruler of Mount
                    Olympus, god of the sky, thunder, lightning, law, order, and justice. As king of the gods, Zeus
                    governs both the divine and mortal realms, arbitrating disputes, enforcing oaths, protecting
                    guests and suppliants, and maintaining cosmic order against the forces of chaos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike some supreme deities who remain distant and inscrutable, Zeus actively intervened in both
                    divine politics and mortal affairs. He fathered numerous children with goddesses, nymphs, and
                    mortal women—many of whom became great heroes, kings, or founders of dynasties. This prolific
                    parentage established Zeus as the progenitor of much of Greek civilization, both divine and
                    human.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Zeus's character combined majesty with accessibility, justice with passion, wisdom with
                    sometimes questionable personal behavior. He could be merciful to suppliants and terrible to
                    those who violated sacred laws. His moods affected the weather and the fate of nations. When
                    pleased, he sent favorable signs; when angry, storms and disasters followed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The thunderbolt epitomized Zeus's dual nature—both protector and punisher, lawgiver and
                    executioner. It represented his authority made visible and his judgment made irrevocable. To
                    face Zeus wielding the thunderbolt was to face divine power in its most absolute and terrifying
                    form.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Major Myths Involving the Thunderbolt</h4>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>The Casting Down of Phaethon</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Phaethon, son of the sun god Helios, convinced his father to let him drive the solar chariot
                        for one day. Unable to control the powerful horses, Phaethon drove too close to the earth,
                        scorching it and threatening to set the entire world ablaze. Rivers dried up, forests burned,
                        and deserts were created where green lands had been.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Gaia (Earth) cried out to Zeus to stop the destruction. Reluctantly, knowing that Phaethon's
                        death would grieve Helios, Zeus nevertheless hurled his thunderbolt. The bolt struck Phaethon
                        from the chariot, sending him plummeting to earth like a falling star. This myth demonstrated
                        that Zeus would use his ultimate weapon even against the innocent when necessary to prevent
                        greater catastrophe—a terrible burden of kingship.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>The Death of Asclepius</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Asclepius, son of Apollo and the greatest physician who ever lived, became so skilled in
                        healing that he could resurrect the dead. While a blessing to mortals, this ability threatened
                        the natural order and Hades' realm. The boundary between life and death, fundamental to
                        cosmic structure, was being violated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hades complained to Zeus that his kingdom was being depopulated, and the Moirae (Fates)
                        protested that Asclepius was interfering with destiny itself. Zeus, seeing that even beneficial
                        powers must respect cosmic boundaries, struck Asclepius down with a thunderbolt. Apollo,
                        grieving and enraged, killed the Cyclopes in revenge—an act for which Zeus nearly cast him
                        into Tartarus, relenting only to sentence him to a year of servitude to mortals.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>The Punishment of Salmoneus</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Salmoneus, a mortal king, grew so proud that he declared himself equal to Zeus. He built a
                        bronze bridge and rode over it in a chariot, dragging bronze pots to simulate thunder, while
                        hurling torches to imitate lightning. He demanded that people worship him as they would Zeus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This impious mockery could not be tolerated. Zeus hurled a real thunderbolt, destroying
                        Salmoneus, his chariot, and his entire city in a single strike. The myth served as a warning
                        against hubris—no mortal could claim equality with the gods, and any who tried to imitate
                        divine powers without divine sanction would face annihilation.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>The Typhonomachy</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Typhon, the most terrible monster ever born—a serpentine giant whose head touched the stars,
                        with a hundred dragon heads growing from his shoulders—rose to challenge Zeus for rulership
                        of the cosmos. Gaia, still angry about the defeat of the Titans, had produced this ultimate
                        weapon to destroy the Olympian order.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In their first encounter, Typhon actually defeated Zeus, cutting the sinews from his hands
                        and feet and imprisoning him. The gods fled in terror, some disguising themselves as animals
                        to hide. Only through the help of Hermes and Pan was Zeus restored and able to continue the
                        fight.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the final battle, Zeus unleashed the full power of the thunderbolt, hurling bolt after
                        bolt at Typhon. The sky blazed with lightning, the earth shook, the seas boiled, and the
                        underworld trembled. Finally, Zeus's thunderbolts prevailed, and he buried the monster beneath
                        Mount Etna in Sicily. The volcano's eruptions are said to be Typhon's fiery breath still
                        trying to escape. This battle demonstrated that even Zeus's ultimate weapon could be challenged,
                        but in the end, no force could overcome it.

                    <p><strong>The Flood of Deucalion</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        When humanity of the Bronze Age became wicked and violent, particularly after the impious
                        king Lycaon tried to trick Zeus into eating human flesh, the king of gods decided to destroy
                        all mortals and start fresh. He used both flood (with Poseidon's help) and thunderbolts to
                        accomplish this apocalypse.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Only Deucalion (son of Prometheus) and his wife Pyrrha survived, warned by Prometheus to
                        build an ark. When the flood subsided, they repopulated the earth by throwing stones over
                        their shoulders, which became new men and women. This myth shows Zeus using the thunderbolt
                        not just against individuals but as an instrument of cosmic reset, destroying an entire age
                        of humanity for their collective crimes.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>The Warning to Hera</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        On several occasions, Hera plotted against Zeus or acted against his will, particularly
                        regarding his mortal paramours and illegitimate children. Once, she went too far, organizing
                        other gods (including Poseidon and Apollo) in a conspiracy to bind Zeus while he slept.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Though rescued by the Hecatoncheires (hundred-handed giants), Zeus was furious at this
                        rebellion. He hung Hera from the sky with golden chains and suspended anvils from her feet.
                        When the other gods begged for her release, Zeus agreed—but warned that if any ever rebelled
                        again, he would hurl them into Tartarus with his thunderbolt. He challenged them to try
                        pulling him from Olympus with a rope, demonstrating that even all the gods together could
                        not overcome him when he wielded the thunderbolt.

        <!-- SYMBOLISM -->
        <div class="glass-card">
            <h3 class="section-title">Symbolism and Spiritual Meaning</h3>
            <div class="content-text">
                <h4 class="subsection-title">Divine Authority and Sovereignty</h4>
                <p>
                    The thunderbolt serves as the ultimate symbol of divine kingship and legitimate authority. In
                    ancient Greek and Roman thought, Zeus/Jupiter's possession of the lightning represented the
                    right to rule—not just through military might but through cosmic sanction. Kings and emperors
                    associated themselves with Jupiter to claim legitimacy, suggesting their earthly rule reflected
                    the heavenly order.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The eagle that carries Zeus's thunderbolts became similarly symbolic of authority, later adopted
                    by Rome as its imperial standard and subsequently by countless nations and empires. The image of
                    eagle clutching lightning bolts remains a powerful heraldic symbol of sovereign power.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Justice and Judgment</h4>
                <p>
                    The thunderbolt represents divine justice—swift, terrible, and final. When Zeus struck with
                    lightning, it served as both verdict and execution. Ancient Greeks saw lightning strikes as
                    divine judgment on specific individuals or places, marking them as guilty of offending the gods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This made Zeus the cosmic judge, maintaining moral order through the threat of ultimate
                    punishment. Oath-breakers, those who violated guest-host relationships, murderers of kin, and
                    the impiously proud all risked Zeus's thunderbolt. The weapon thus enforced not just physical
                    but moral and social order.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">The Awful Majesty of Nature</h4>
                <p>
                    Before scientific understanding of weather, lightning was perhaps nature's most terrifying
                    phenomenon—unpredictable, lethal, accompanied by deafening thunder, capable of splitting trees
                    and igniting fires. Zeus's thunderbolt symbolized humanity's awe before nature's power and the
                    attempt to understand catastrophic forces as expressions of divine will.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The personification of lightning as a divine weapon made the chaos of storms comprehensible. It
                    was not random destruction but Zeus's purposeful action. This provided psychological comfort—
                    the universe was governed by an intelligence, even if that intelligence was dangerous and not
                    always comprehensible to mortals.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Sudden Transformation and Revelation</h4>
                <p>
                    Lightning illuminates darkness in a brilliant flash, revealing what was hidden. The thunderbolt
                    thus symbolizes sudden enlightenment, revelation, or transformation. In an instant, everything
                    changes—what was is no more, and new reality is established in its place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This transformative aspect appears in various myths where Zeus's lightning changes mortals into
                    gods, burns away earthly elements leaving only divine essence, or marks individuals for special
                    destiny. The thunderbolt represents the moment of crisis that fundamentally alters existence.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">The Price of Approaching the Divine</h4>
                <p>
                    Several myths feature mortals destroyed by proximity to Zeus's full divine nature, which
                    manifests as lightning. Semele, desiring to see Zeus in his true form, was burned to ash by the
                    sight of his glory. This symbolizes the danger of approaching ultimate reality—the divine is so
                    far beyond mortal capacity that direct encounter means destruction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The thunderbolt thus represents the unbridgeable gap between divine and mortal, the awesome
                    otherness of deity that cannot be domesticated or made safe. It warns against presumption and
                    excessive pride, reminding mortals of their proper place in the cosmic hierarchy.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Masculine Power and Fertility</h4>
                <p>
                    The phallic symbolism of the lightning bolt—a shaft of energy penetrating from sky to earth—
                    was not lost on ancient observers. Zeus's thunderbolts striking the earth paralleled his
                    numerous sexual conquests, making the weapon a symbol of masculine generative power as well as
                    destructive force.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rain following thunderstorms fertilized the earth, and Zeus was associated with both the storm
                    and the life-giving rain. The thunderbolt thus represented the violent but ultimately creative
                    power of the sky father impregnating the earth mother—a fundamental pattern in Indo-European
                    mythology.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Modern Symbolic Usage</h4>
                <p>
                    The lightning bolt remains one of the most recognizable and versatile symbols in modern culture:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Electricity and electrical power (appearing on warning signs worldwide)</li>
                    <li>Sudden insight or inspiration (the "lightning bolt moment" or "bolt from the blue")</li>
                    <li>Speed and energy (used by sports teams, energy drink brands, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Military and imperial authority (in heraldry and insignia)</li>
                    <li>Divine power and supernatural abilities (in countless fantasy and superhero contexts)</li>
                    <li>Danger and warning (particularly regarding electrical hazards)</li>

                <p>
                    Zeus's thunderbolt features prominently in modern adaptations of Greek mythology:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rick Riordan's "Percy Jackson" series:</strong> The theft of Zeus's master bolt
                    drives the plot of "The Lightning Thief," treating it as the most powerful weapon in existence,
                    capable of vaporizing anything it touches. The series emphasizes both its destructive power and
                    its political significance—without it, Zeus's authority is compromised.</li>
                    <li><strong>"Clash of the Titans" (1981 and 2010):</strong> Zeus uses thunderbolts throughout
                    both versions, though the remake emphasizes more spectacular visual effects with Zeus hurling
                    multiple bolts in battle.</li>
                    <li><strong>"Immortals" (2011):</strong> Depicts Zeus and other gods wielding lightning in
                    stylized combat against Titans, with emphasis on the devastating power of divine weapons.</li>
                    <li><strong>"Wrath of the Titans" (2012):</strong> Features Zeus's lightning as central to
                    maintaining cosmic order, with its power fading as fewer mortals worship the gods.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Video Games</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>God of War Series:</strong> Zeus wields lightning extensively in combat against
                    Kratos, using it both as projectile attacks and to enhance physical strikes. The final
                    confrontation features Zeus channeling massive amounts of lightning.</li>
                    <li><strong>Smite:</strong> Zeus's abilities all involve lightning—chain lightning between
                    enemies, electric shields, and an ultimate that calls down bolts on marked targets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Age of Mythology:</strong> Zeus faction gains powerful lightning bolt abilities
                    as divine powers, able to strike down enemy units.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hades:</strong> Zeus appears as a supporting character offering boons related to
                    lightning and chain lightning effects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Assassin's Creed Odyssey:</strong> Features legendary spear tips said to contain
                    Zeus's lightning, granting electrical damage.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Comics and Superheroes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>DC Comics:</strong> Shazam (Captain Marvel) calls down lightning from Zeus (among
                    other gods) as part of his power set, transforming him from mortal to superhero.</li>
                    <li><strong>Marvel Comics:</strong> Zeus appears occasionally as an immensely powerful deity,
                    with lightning abilities rivaling Thor's thunder. Crossovers between Greek and Norse gods often
                    compare Mjolnir and the thunderbolt.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wonder Woman:</strong> As daughter of Zeus in current continuity, Diana can
                    sometimes channel lightning, manifesting her divine heritage.</li>

                    to suggest speed and power</li>
                    <li><strong>Gatorade:</strong> The sports drink's original logo featured a lightning bolt,

                    <li><strong>AC/DC:</strong> The rock band's logo features a lightning bolt between letters,

                    <li><strong>Flash/Quicksilver:</strong> Speedster superheroes often use lightning bolt emblems
                    to represent super-speed</li>
                    <li><strong>Electricity companies:</strong> Many power utilities incorporate lightning bolts in

                <p>
                    The lightning bolt's association with Zeus/Jupiter made it attractive to political powers:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Roman legions carried eagle standards, associating imperial authority with Jupiter</li>
                    <li>Various military units worldwide use lightning bolt insignia to suggest striking power</li>
                    <li>The United States Army Signal Corps uses crossed flags with lightning bolt to represent
                    communications</li>
                    <li>Fascist Italy heavily emphasized Roman imagery including Jupiter's lightning</li>
                    <li>The Nazi SS unfortunately appropriated lightning bolt imagery (their symbol was stylized
                    double lightning), forever tainting what had been a widespread Indo-European symbol</li>
                </ul>
