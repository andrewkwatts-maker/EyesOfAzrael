                <p>1. It is true, certain, and without falsehood, that whatever is below is like that which is above; and that which is above is like that which is below: to accomplish the one wonderful work.</p>
                <p>2. As all things are derived from the One Only Thing, by the will and by the word of the One Only One who created it in His Mind, so all things owe their existence to this Unity by the order of Nature, and can be improved by Adaptation to that Mind.</p>
                <p>3. Its Father is the Sun; its Mother is the Moon; the Wind carries it in its womb; and its nurse is the Earth.</p>
                <p>4. This Thing is the Father of all perfect things in the world.</p>
                <p>5. Its power is most perfect when it has again been changed into Earth.</p>
                <p>6. Separate the Earth from the Fire, the subtle from the gross, gently and with great prudence.</p>
                <p>7. It ascends from Earth to Heaven, and descends again, new-born, to the Earth, taking unto itself thereby the power of the Above and the Below.</p>
                <p>8. Thus the splendor of the whole world will be thine, and all darkness shall flee from thee.</p>
                <p>9. This is the strongest of all powers, the Force of all forces, for it overcometh all subtle things and can penetrate all that is solid.</p>
                <p>10. For thus was the world created, and rare combinations, and wonders of many kinds are wrought.</p>
                <p>11. Hence I am called Hermes Trismegistus, having the three parts of the philosophy of the whole world.</p>

                    The Emerald Tablet (Latin: Tabula Smaragdina, Arabic: Lawh al-Zumurrudh) is a compact cryptic text
                    that has served as the foundational document of Western alchemy and Hermetic philosophy for over a
                    thousand years. Attributed to the legendary sage Hermes Trismegistus ("Thrice-Great Hermes"), it
                    claims to contain the secret of the prima materia and the process for creating the Philosopher's
                    Stone in veiled, allegorical language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to legend, the text was originally inscribed on a tablet made of emerald (or a green
                    crystalline substance) using the Phoenician alphabet. The physical tablet was reportedly discovered
                    by various figures across different traditions: Alexander the Great finding it in the hands of
                    Hermes's mummified body in a cave near Hebron, Sarah (wife of Abraham) discovering it in Hermes's
                    tomb, or Apollonius of Tyana extracting it from Hermes's crypt. These discovery narratives
                    emphasize the text's antiquity and sacred transmission.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In reality, the earliest surviving text appears in Arabic works from the 6th to 8th centuries CE,
                    likely composed in Hellenistic Egypt where Greek philosophy, Egyptian religion, and Jewish mysticism
                    merged to create the Hermetic tradition. The text synthesizes cosmological, alchemical, and spiritual
                    principles into a dense formula that has been interpreted and reinterpreted for centuries.

            <h3 class="section-title">Hermes Trismegistus - The Thrice-Great</h3>
            <div class="content-text">
                <p>
                    The Emerald Tablet is attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, a legendary figure who represents the
                    syncretism of the Greek god Hermes (messenger of the gods, inventor of writing) with the Egyptian
                    god Thoth (ibis-headed deity of wisdom, writing, and magic). This composite figure emerged in
                    Hellenistic Egypt, where Greek and Egyptian cultures merged under Ptolemaic rule.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Trismegistus" means "Thrice-Great" or "Three Times Greatest," a title perhaps referring to Hermes's
                    mastery of three wisdoms: alchemy (operation of the Sun), astrology (operation of the Moon), and
                    theurgy (operation of the Stars). Alternative interpretations connect the three to body, mind, and
                    spirit, or to the three worlds (celestial, terrestrial, and subterranean) that Hermes rules as
                    psychopomp.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">The Hermetic Corpus</h4>
                <p>
                    Beyond the Emerald Tablet, Hermes Trismegistus is credited with an enormous body of writings
                    collectively called the Hermetica. The philosophical Hermetica, particularly the Corpus Hermeticum
                    and the Asclepius, present dialogues on cosmology, theology, and the nature of the divine mind.
                    The technical Hermetica include works on alchemy, astrology, and magic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the Renaissance, when the Corpus Hermeticum was translated into Latin by Marsilio Ficino
                    (1463), European scholars believed these texts predated Plato and Moses, representing prisca
                    theologia (ancient theology) from which all later wisdom derived. This belief elevated Hermes
                    Trismegistus to supreme importance in Western esotericism, though scholars now date most
                    Hermetic texts to the early centuries CE.

                    The opening declaration - "whatever is below is like that which is above; and that which is above
                    is like that which is below" - has become the most famous expression of Hermetic philosophy. This
                    principle of correspondence asserts that the macrocosm (universe, heavens, divine realm) and
                    microcosm (human being, earth, material realm) mirror each other. Understanding one reveals
                    understanding of the other.

                <p>
                    This correspondence operates in multiple directions. The human being is a miniature universe,
                    containing within themselves all cosmic principles. Conversely, the universe operates according
                    to the same laws visible in human psychology and physiology. The alchemist works simultaneously
                    on external matter and internal spirit, each transformation reflecting and enabling the other.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">The One Thing</h4>
                <p>
                    The tablet speaks of "the One Only Thing" from which all things derive and the process by which
                    it can be refined. This One Thing has been interpreted as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Prima Materia:</strong> The first matter from which all substances derive, unformed
                    potential waiting to be shaped by the Great Work</li>
                    <li><strong>The Philosopher's Stone:</strong> The perfected substance that can transmute other
                    materials to their highest form</li>
                    <li><strong>Divine Mind:</strong> The unified consciousness from which creation emerges and to
                    which enlightened minds return</li>
                    <li><strong>The Self:</strong> The unified personality that emerges from psychological
                    integration (in Jungian interpretation)</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Sun, Moon, Wind, and Earth</h4>
                <p>
                    The tablet describes the One Thing's genealogy through elemental and celestial parents. The Sun
                    (solar, masculine, active principle) is its father; the Moon (lunar, feminine, receptive
                    principle) is its mother. The Wind (spirit, breath, mediating principle) carries it, and Earth
                    (material realm, body) nurtures it. This quaternary framework maps onto numerous symbolic systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alchemically, these correspond to Sulfur (Sun), Mercury (Moon), and Salt (Earth), with Wind/Air
                    representing the volatile spirit that must be fixed. The process described - ascending to heaven
                    and descending to earth - mirrors the alchemical operations of sublimation and condensation, as
                    well as the spiritual journey of enlightenment and incarnation.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Separation and Conjunction</h4>
                <p>
                    "Separate the Earth from the Fire, the subtle from the gross" describes the analytical phase of
                    the Work - discrimination between pure and impure, essential and accidental, spiritual and
                    material. This separation must be performed "gently and with great prudence," suggesting that
                    violent or hasty approaches destroy what they seek to purify.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The subsequent ascending and descending describes conjunction - the reunification of separated
                    elements at a higher level of integration. Having been separated and purified, the elements
                    recombine with enhanced power, uniting the virtues of Above and Below in a single perfected
                    substance or state of being.

            <div class="content-text">
                <h4 class="subsection-title">Medieval Alchemy</h4>
                <p>
                    When Arabic alchemical texts containing the Emerald Tablet were translated into Latin in the 12th
                    century, they sparked intense interest in Western Europe. The tablet became the authoritative
                    statement of alchemical principles, cited and commented upon by virtually every subsequent
                    alchemical writer. Its cryptic nature invited endless interpretation, with each commentator
                    finding their own system encoded in its verses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Major alchemists including Albertus Magnus, Roger Bacon, and Thomas Aquinas (or pseudo-Aquinas)
                    produced commentaries on the tablet. These interpretations connected its cosmology to Aristotelian
                    natural philosophy, creating a synthesis that dominated late medieval and Renaissance thought
                    about matter, transformation, and the relationship between physical and spiritual realms.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Renaissance Revival</h4>
                <p>
                    The Renaissance saw a dramatic revival of interest in Hermetic literature. Marsilio Ficino's
                    translation of the Corpus Hermeticum, commissioned by Cosimo de' Medici, placed Hermetic thought
                    at the center of Renaissance intellectual culture. The Emerald Tablet's principles of correspondence
                    and unity influenced artists, philosophers, and scientists alike.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The principle "as above, so below" provided theoretical grounding for astrology, supporting the
                    belief that celestial events corresponded to terrestrial ones. It also supported the idea that
                    humans, as microcosms, could understand and even influence the macrocosm through knowledge and
                    practice. This empowering vision contributed to the Renaissance sense of human potential.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Isaac Newton's Translation</h4>
                <p>
                    Among the many prominent figures who studied the Emerald Tablet, Isaac Newton devoted considerable
                    attention to both alchemy and Hermetic philosophy. Newton produced his own translation of the
                    tablet from Latin, preserved among his alchemical papers. While he published nothing on alchemy
                    during his lifetime, these private writings show that the founder of modern physics took Hermetic
                    principles seriously.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some historians argue that Newton's concept of gravity as action at a distance, and his vision
                    of a universe governed by universal laws, owes something to Hermetic ideas of cosmic correspondence
                    and unified causation. The relationship between Newton's public science and private alchemy
                    remains a subject of scholarly debate.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Modern Esotericism</h4>
                <p>
                    The Emerald Tablet continues to influence modern esoteric movements. The Hermetic Order of the
                    Golden Dawn, Theosophy, and various New Age traditions draw on its principles. "As above, so below"
                    has become a widely recognized phrase beyond specifically esoteric contexts, entering popular
                    culture as a general principle of correspondence and reflection.

                    <strong>Key Commentators and Interpreters</strong>
                    Notable figures who wrote on the Emerald Tablet include: Albertus Magnus, Roger Bacon, Arnaldus
                    de Villa Nova, Hortulanus, Michael Maier, Heinrich Khunrath, and Isaac Newton, each bringing
                    their own perspective to its mysteries.

                    <strong>Arabic Transmission</strong>
                    The Arabic version appears in several texts attributed to Jabir ibn Hayyan (Geber) and in the
                    "Sirr al-Khaliqa" (Secret of Creation) attributed to Apollonius of Tyana (Balinas). These texts
                    preserved and transmitted the tablet to medieval Europe.

                    <strong>The Twelve Verses</strong>
                    While different versions vary in exact wording, the structure of twelve (or sometimes thirteen)
                    verses remained consistent. This number connects to zodiacal symbolism and the stages of the
                    alchemical work.

                <p>
                    The tablet's emerald material connects to the color green's rich symbolic associations. Green
                    represents life, growth, and nature; Venus, the planet of love and harmony; the heart chakra in
                    some systems; and the "green lion" of alchemy - the corrosive yet vivifying substance that
                    dissolves gold. The emerald's clarity suggests truth seen purely, wisdom crystallized into
                    permanent form.

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Vertical Circulation</h4>
                <p>
                    The described motion - ascending to heaven and descending to earth - represents the circulation
                    of spiritual energy through levels of being. What rises is purified by contact with the Above;
                    what descends brings spiritual power into material manifestation. This vertical exchange unites
                    the worlds and enables transformation.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">The Three Parts</h4>
                <p>
                    Hermes claims "the three parts of the philosophy of the whole world." These have been interpreted
                    as the three traditional occult arts (alchemy, astrology, theurgy), the three levels of reality
                    (physical, psychological, spiritual), or the three stages of the alchemical work (nigredo, albedo,
                    rubedo). The triangular structure suggests completeness and stability.
                </p>

                <h4 class="subsection-title">Unity in Multiplicity</h4>
                <p>
                    The tablet's central message concerns the underlying unity behind apparent multiplicity. All
                    things derive from the One Thing; diversity is appearance, unity is reality. This non-dual
                    philosophy connects Hermeticism to mystical traditions worldwide that teach the ultimate oneness
                    of existence. The alchemist who realizes this unity gains power over transformation.
