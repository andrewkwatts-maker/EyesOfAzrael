Accompanied by his nephew <a class=\"corpus-link\" data-term=\"Iolaus\" data-tradition=\"greek\" href=\"../../../mythos/greek/corpus-search.html?term=iolaus\" title=\"Search corpus for 'Iolaus'\">Iolaus</a> as his charioteer, Heracles traveled to Lerna. Finding the Hydra's lair, he shot flaming arrows into the swamp to force the beast out into the open.</p>\n\n<p>When the Hydra emerged, Heracles attacked with his club and sword, but quickly discovered the monster's terrible secret: for every head he severed, two more would grow back in its place. The Hydra's regenerative power seemed to make it truly invincible. As Heracles struggled, <a class=\"corpus-link\" data-term=\"Hera\" data-tradition=\"greek\" href=\"../../../mythos/greek/corpus-search.html?term=hera\" title=\"Search corpus for 'Hera'\">Hera</a> sent a giant crab to aid the Hydra by biting at the hero's feet, but Heracles crushed it underfoot. (In some versions, <a class=\"corpus-link\" data-term=\"Hera\" data-tradition=\"greek\" href=\"../../../mythos/greek/corpus-search.html?term=hera\" title=\"Search corpus for 'Hera'\">Hera</a> later placed this crab among the stars as the constellation Cancer.)</p>\n\n<p>Realizing that brute force alone would not suffice, Heracles called upon <a class=\"corpus-link\" data-term=\"Iolaus\" data-tradition=\"greek\" href=\"../../../mythos/greek/corpus-search.html?term=iolaus\" title=\"Search corpus for 'Iolaus'\">Iolaus</a> for assistance. As Heracles severed each head, Iolaus immediately cauterized the bleeding stump with a burning torch or brand, searing the wound and preventing new heads from regenerating. One by one, the Hydra's heads fell until only the immortal head remained.</p>\n\n<p>The central head of the Hydra was immortal and could not be killed by any means. Unable to destroy it, Heracles severed it with a golden sword (given to him by <a class=\"corpus-link\" data-term=\"Athena\" data-tradition=\"greek\" href=\"../../../mythos/greek/corpus-search.html?term=athena\" title=\"Search corpus for 'Athena'\">Athena</a> in some versions) and buried it beneath a massive boulder on the road from Lerna to Elaius.

Heracles shot him with one of his Hydra-poisoned arrows. As he lay dying, Nessus deceived Deianira, telling her that his blood-soaked tunic would serve as a love charm to ensure Heracles' faithfulness. When Deianira later sent the robe to Heracles, fearing he had taken another lover, the Hydra's venom burned into his flesh. Unable to remove the garment without tearing away his own skin, and unable to bear the agony, Heracles built his own funeral pyre on Mount Oeta.
