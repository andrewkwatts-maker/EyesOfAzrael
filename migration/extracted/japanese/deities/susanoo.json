        "title": "Birth from Izanagi's Nose",
        "summary": "<li> When Izanagi purified himself after fleeing Yomi, Susanoo was born from his nose - fitting origin for a god of howling winds. Unlike his siblings who accepted their celestial domains, Susanoo wept and raged, longing for his mother Izanami in the underworld. His uncontrollable grief caused mountains to wither and seas to dry up, prompting Izanagi to exile him from heaven before he ever properly ruled.</li>"
      },
      {
        "title": "The Destruction in Heaven",
        "summary": "<li> Before his exile, Susanoo visited Amaterasu in Takamagahara, claiming peaceful intentions. Initially Amaterasu was suspicious, but after a divine contest of creation seemed to prove his sincerity, she lowered her guard. Susanoo then went on a destructive rampage: he broke down the ridges between Amaterasu's celestial rice paddies, defiled her sacred halls with excrement, and horrifically threw a flayed piebald horse through the roof of her weaving hall, killing one of her maidens. This violence drove Amaterasu into her cave, plunging the world into darkness.</li>"

        "title": "Exile and the Slaying of Yamata-no-Orochi",
        "summary": "<li> Cast down from heaven with his beard cut off and nails torn out (symbolic mutilation), Susanoo wandered to Izumo Province. There he encountered an elderly couple weeping over their daughter Kushinadahime - their eighth and last child, as the eight-headed, eight-tailed dragon Yamata-no-Orochi had devoured the others. Susanoo agreed to slay the monster in exchange for Kushinadahime's hand. He transformed her into a comb (kushinada means \"wondrous comb\") for safety, then prepared eight vats of sake. The dragon, lured by the alcohol, stuck its eight heads into the vats and became drunk. Susanoo then hacked it to pieces with his sword. In the dragon's tail, he discovered the legendary sword Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi (\"Grass-Cutting Sword\"), which he presented to Amaterasu as a peace offering. This sword became one of the Three Imperial Regalia.</li>"
      },
      {
        "title": "Marriage and the Palace of Suga",
        "summary": "<li> After slaying Orochi, Susanoo married Kushinadahime and built a palace at Suga in Izumo. Looking upon the rising clouds over his new home, he composed what is considered Japan's first waka poem: \"Yakumo tatsu / Izumo yaegaki / Tsuma-gomi ni / Yaegaki tsukuru / Sono yaegaki wo\" - \"Many clouds arise / The clouds of Izumo / For the dwelling of husband and wife / I build a many-layered fence / Oh, that many-layered fence!\" This moment marks his transformation from chaos-bringer to civilized being capable of beauty and creation.</li>"

      {
        "title": "Lord of Ne-no-Kuni",

There he later tested and eventually blessed the hero Okuninushi, who sought refuge with him, eventually giving Okuninushi his daughter and magical items to help him establish rule over Izumo.</li>"
