Their creative union produced the divine framework of nature itself. However, when Izanami gave birth to Kagutsuchi, the fire god, his flames burned her. Despite Izanagi's grief and care, she died from her injuries - the first death among the kami. In his rage and sorrow, Izanagi beheaded Kagutsuchi with his sword Totsuka, and from the fire god's blood and body sprang yet more kami, including thunder gods and mountain deities.</p>"

As he stripped off his garments and ornaments, various kami were born from each item. As he washed in the water, deities of pollution and purification arose. Finally, washing his face produced the three most noble kami: <a href=\"amaterasu.html\">Amaterasu</a> from his left eye, <a href=\"tsukuyomi.html\">Tsukuyomi</a> from his right eye, and <a href=\"susanoo.html\">Susanoo</a> from his nose. This misogi ritual established the fundamental Shinto practice of purification through water.</p>"
