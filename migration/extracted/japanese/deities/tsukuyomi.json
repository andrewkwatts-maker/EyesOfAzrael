        "summary": "<li> During the purification rite (misogi) at the river mouth of Tachibana in Himuka, Izanagi washed his face to cleanse the pollution of Yomi. As he washed his right eye, the luminous Tsukuyomi was born, complementing Amaterasu who emerged from the left eye. Izanagi assigned him to rule the realms of night, making him co-regent of the heavens with his sister. In some versions, he was born equal in beauty and brightness to Amaterasu, differing only in the coolness of his silver light.</li>"

      {
        "title": "The Murder of Uke Mochi (The Goddess of Food)",
        "summary": "<li> This myth explains the eternal separation of sun and moon. Amaterasu sent Tsukuyomi to visit Uke Mochi, the goddess of food, on her behalf. When Tsukuyomi arrived, Uke Mochi prepared a feast for him using her divine power: she faced the sea and spat out fish, faced the forest and expelled game from her mouth, and facing the rice paddies, coughed up bowls of rice. Though the food was divine and pure, Tsukuyomi was so disgusted by the manner of its creation that he drew his sword and killed her. From Uke Mochi's corpse sprang the five grains (rice, wheat, millet, beans, and hemp) as well as silkworms and cattle - blessings for humanity born from divine death. When Amaterasu learned of this killing, she was so horrified by his violence against a fellow kami that she declared she would never look upon his face again. From that moment, sun and moon have been separated - Amaterasu ruling day, Tsukuyomi banished to eternal night, forever chasing his sister across the sky but never catching her.</li>"

      {
        "title": "The Counting of Time",
        "summary": "<li> As the \"Moon-Reader,\" Tsukuyomi's passage across the night sky became the basis for the lunar calendar. His waxing and waning mark the months, his cycles determining the timing of festivals, plantings, and ceremonies. This role as cosmic timekeeper makes him essential to the order of the world despite his isolation - even in exile, he serves a vital function in maintaining the rhythm of existence.</li>"

The rabbit seen \"pounding mochi in the moon\" represents the kami's celestial court, companions to the lonely moon god in his eternal journey through the night.</li>"
