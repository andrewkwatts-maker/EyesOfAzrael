While Khnum released the flood waters, Satis personified the swift, powerful current itself—shooting forth like an arrow from the south. Her daughter <a class=\"corpus-link\" data-term=\"Anuket\" data-tradition=\"egyptian\" href=\"../corpus-search.html?term=anuket\" title=\"Search corpus for 'Anuket'\">Anuket</a> embraced the waters once they arrived, but Satis represented the initial surge, the unstoppable force that could not be turned back.</p>\n\n<p>Satis was also a warrior goddess who guarded Egypt's southern border. In this role, she was depicted with bow and arrow, ready to strike down any who threatened Egypt from Nubia or beyond. Her arrows were said to be as swift and deadly as the flood waters were life-giving—two sides of the same unstoppable force.</p>"
