        "summary": "<li> Erlang Shen (Yang Jian) was born from the union of a mortal man, Yang Tianyou, and the Jade Emperor's sister, the goddess Yaoji. This forbidden marriage enraged the Jade Emperor, who imprisoned Yaoji beneath Mount Tao. Young Erlang Shen eventually grew powerful enough to cleave the mountain with his axe and free his mother, only to witness her die from the Jade Emperor's punishment.</li>"

        "title": "Splitting the Mountain",
        "summary": "<li> The tale of Erlang Shen splitting Mount Tao to save his mother (or in some versions, Mount Hua) became one of the most beloved stories in Chinese folklore, symbolizing filial devotion and the willingness to defy heaven itself for family. This story inspired later tales of similar heroic rescues.</li>"

        "title": "Taming the Floods",
        "summary": "<li> In some traditions, Erlang Shen is credited with controlling devastating floods by channeling rivers and defeating water demons.

The two engaged in an epic battle of transformations - Sun Wukong transformed into a sparrow, Erlang became a hawk; the monkey became a fish, the god became a cormorant. Erlang Shen's third eye could see through each disguise, making him the only warrior who could match Sun Wukong in combat.</li>"

He often acts independently, is said to \"listen to the celestial decrees but not the celestial summons\" (听调不听宣), and dwells at Guankou rather than in the celestial court. This independence reflects his resentment over his mother's fate.</li>"
