        "summary": "<li> The most popular origin story tells of Zhang Lang, a mortal man who abandoned his faithful wife Guo Dingxiang to marry a younger woman. His new wife was cruel and wasteful, and eventually left him. Zhang Lang became a beggar, wandering until he arrived by chance at the door of his former wife, who had remarried and prospered. She recognized him and kindly gave him food. Overcome with shame, Zhang Lang threw himself into her kitchen fire. The Jade Emperor, moved by this act of remorse, appointed him Kitchen God - condemned forever to watch over the domestic realm he had once betrayed.</li>"

        "title": "The Sweet Bribe",

One family, anxious about their misbehavior throughout the year, smeared honey on Zao Jun's lips so he would only speak sweet words to the Jade Emperor - or so his lips would stick together and he could not report at all! This custom became universal.</li>"
