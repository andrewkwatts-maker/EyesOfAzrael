## Conclusion

This comprehensive historical metadata enhancement provides rigorous scholarly grounding for Celtic mythology in the Eyes of Azrael database. By documenting evidence sources, scholarly consensus, archaeological findings, and modern applications, the enhancement supports multiple user communities: historians, practitioners, educators, and enthusiasts.

The metadata demonstrates that Celtic deities have varying levels of historical attestation, with some (like Lugh and Ogma) having multiple independent evidence sources, while others (like Danu) rely primarily on literary preservation. Understanding these distinctions enables more informed engagement with Celtic mythology, whether for historical research, spiritual practice, or educational purposes.
