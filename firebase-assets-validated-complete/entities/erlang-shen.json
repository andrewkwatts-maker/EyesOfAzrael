        "name": "Divine Birth and Family Tragedy",
        "description": "Erlang Shen (Yang Jian) was born from the union of a mortal man, Yang Tianyou, and the Jade Emperor's sister, the goddess Yaoji. This forbidden marriage enraged the Jade Emperor, who imprisoned Yaoji beneath Mount Tao.

        "name": "Splitting the Mountain",
        "description": "The tale of Erlang Shen splitting Mount Tao to save his mother (or in some versions, Mount Hua) became one of the most beloved stories in Chinese folklore, symbolizing filial devotion and the willingness to defy heaven itself for family.

        "description": "In <em>Journey to the West</em>, when all other celestial warriors failed to capture the rebellious Monkey King, Erlang Shen was dispatched. The two engaged in an epic battle of transformations - Sun Wukong transformed into a sparrow, Erlang became a hawk; the monkey became a fish, the god became a cormorant.

        "name": "Conflict with the Jade Emperor",
        "description": "Despite being the Jade Emperor's nephew, Erlang Shen maintains a complicated relationship with heaven.

This independence reflects his resentment over his mother's fate."
