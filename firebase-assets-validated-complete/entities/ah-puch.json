  "description": "The terrifying god of death, decay, and the underworld, Ah Puch rules over <span class=\"mayan-term\">Xibalba</span>,\n                the Maya realm of the dead. Depicted as a skeletal figure with protruding ribs, exposed spine, and\n                a bloated belly of corruption, he embodies the horror and inevitability of death. Yet the Maya\n                understood death not as an end but as a transformation - and Ah Puch, however fearsome, was part\n                of the cosmic cycle that made rebirth possible. His defeat by the Hero Twins established the\n                pattern of death and resurrection at the heart of Maya religion.",
