    "festivals": "The annual <strong>Ogun Festival</strong> in Ondo State, Nigeria, features processions of blacksmiths, hunters, and warriors. Dogs are sacrificed, palm wine flows, and devotees dance with machetes. In the diaspora, Ogun's day (usually Tuesday or Wednesday) is observed with offerings and prayers by those in his service.",
    "sacred places": "Ogun's shrines are found at forges, along roads and paths, at the entrance to compounds, and in the wilderness.
