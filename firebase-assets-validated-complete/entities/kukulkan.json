  "description": "The great feathered serpent is one of the most important deities of Mesoamerica, worshipped from the\n                earliest Olmec civilizations through the Maya and Aztec empires. As K'uk'ulkan among the Yucatec Maya\n                and Q'uq'umatz among the K'iche', this winged serpent god brought knowledge, civilization, and the\n                sacred calendar to humanity. His descent as a serpent of light at Chichen Itza each equinox remains\n                one of the world's most spectacular archaeoastronomical phenomena.",
