    "the osun festival": "The annual festival begins with the lighting of the sixteen-point lamp and proceeds through several days of rituals culminating in a procession to the river. The Arugba (virgin votary) carries the sacred calabash on her head to the river, where it is offered to Oshun. Devotees wade into the river to receive blessings, and the waters are believed to heal illness and grant fertility.",
    "sacred site - the osun-osogbo sacred grove": "The <strong>Osun-Osogbo Sacred Grove</strong> along the Osun River in Osun State, Nigeria, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the most important shrine to Oshun. The grove contains shrines, sculptures, and sacred spaces dating back centuries. The annual <strong>Osun-Osogbo Festival</strong> in August draws hundreds of thousands of devotees who come to honor Oshun, make offerings to the river, and receive her blessings for fertility and prosperity."
