    "festivals": "The <strong>Yemoja Festival</strong> in Abeokuta, Nigeria, is a major annual celebration featuring processions to the river, offerings of food and flowers, and prayers for fertility and protection. In Brazil, <strong>Festa de Iemanja</strong> on February 2nd sees millions of people at beaches offering flowers, perfume, and mirrors to the sea. In Rio, boats carry offerings to be thrown into the ocean.",
    "sacred sites": "In Nigeria, Yemoja's primary sacred site is the <strong>Ogun River</strong> in Ogun State, where an annual festival is held. The river's source at the hills is considered especially sacred. In the diaspora, the ocean itself is her shrine - devotees make offerings at the beach, especially at sunset or during the full moon."

  "description": "The universal mother who gave birth to many of the Orisha, Yemoja is the great nurturer and protector. Her realm is the ocean and the Ogun River in Nigeria. She embodies the deep, mysterious, life-giving power of the waters. Yemoja fiercely protects women, especially pregnant women and mothers, and all who dwell near the sea. Her embrace is like the ocean - vast, nurturing, and capable of tremendous power when her children are threatened.",
