    "the ch'a chaak ceremony": "This ancient rain-calling ceremony survived Spanish colonization and continues among modern Maya\n                communities. Conducted by a <span class=\"mayan-term\">h-men</span> (ritual specialist), the ceremony\n                typically involves an altar representing the cosmos, offerings of food and drink, and prayers to\n                the four Chaacs at the cardinal directions. Young boys often participate, croaking like frogs to\n                call the rain - frogs being considered Chaac's messengers and heralds.",

  "description": "Among the oldest and most widely worshipped deities of the Maya, Chaac is the god of rain, thunder,\n                and lightning. With his distinctive long nose and jade ornaments, he wields a great lightning axe\n                to split the clouds and release the waters that sustain all life. As the lord of agriculture and\n                fertility, Chaac was essential to Maya survival, his favor bringing bountiful harvests and his\n                anger devastating droughts. His goggle-eyed visage adorns countless temples across the Maya world.",
