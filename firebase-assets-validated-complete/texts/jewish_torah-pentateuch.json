These five books - Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy - contain the creation narrative, patriarchal history, exodus from Egypt, Sinai covenant and law, wilderness wanderings, and Moses' final addresses. Matthew's Gospel is structured around five major discourses that deliberately mirror the Torah's fivefold structure, presenting Jesus as the new and greater Moses who gives authoritative interpretation of the Law.",
