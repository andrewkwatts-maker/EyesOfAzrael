  "description": "The Descent of Inanna is one of the oldest recorded myths in human history, preserved on cuneiform tablets from ancient Sumer. The goddess Inanna, Queen of Heaven and Earth, descends to the underworld realm of Kur to visit her sister Ereshkigal, Queen of the Dead. At each of seven gates, she is stripped of her divine powers and regalia, arriving naked and powerless before the throne of death itself.",
