  "longDescription": "This theory proposes that Revelation's architectural descriptions encode dimensional physics: 12 gates as 12 spatial dimensions of the (12,1) signature shadow brane, 144 cubits as χ_total = 144 Euler characteristic with Z₂ symmetry, 12,000 stadia cube as 12D hypercube geometry, and the 'eye of a needle' as dimensional compression portal from 4D to 13D. The theory acknowledges that 12 is symbolically ubiquitous in ancient Near Eastern literature, making retrofitting physics concepts highly questionable.",
