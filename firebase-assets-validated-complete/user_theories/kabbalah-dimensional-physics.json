  "longDescription": "This theory proposes remarkable structural correspondences between Kabbalistic cosmology and modern theoretical physics. The analysis explores connections between the 10 Sefirot and 10-dimensional M-theory, the 72 Names of God and Euler characteristic χ=72 in Calabi-Yau manifolds, and the 4 Worlds as dimensional hierarchies. The theory presents these as hypotheses for investigation, with explicit confidence ratings and intellectual honesty warnings about apophenia risks.",
