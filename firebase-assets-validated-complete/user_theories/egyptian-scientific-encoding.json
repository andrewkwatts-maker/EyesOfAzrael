  "longDescription": "This theory proposes linguistic and symbolic correspondences between Egyptian deity names and modern chemical elements. Ra matches the element symbol Ra (Radium) and is associated with light/glow (radioluminescence). Thoth contains 'Th' (Thorium) and mythology describes Thoth creating Ra, mirroring Thorium's decay to Radium in nuclear physics. The theory acknowledges severe limitations: apophenia risk, anachronism (modern chemistry postdates mythology), and lack of archaeological evidence.",
