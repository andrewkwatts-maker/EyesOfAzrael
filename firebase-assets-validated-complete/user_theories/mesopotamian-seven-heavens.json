  "longDescription": "This theory proposes that Mesopotamian cosmology's 8-level structure (7 visible planets as heavens + Earth) encodes 8-brane physics: two stacks of 4 branes each with Z₂ mirror symmetry. The 7 planetary heavens (Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn) correspond to 7 shadow/hidden branes, while Earth is the 1 observable brane. Ziggurat architecture with 7 levels may represent physical models. Base-60 mathematics potentially encodes dimensional ratios. The theory acknowledges this likely reflects observational astronomy (7 visible wandering stars) rather than encoded physics.",
