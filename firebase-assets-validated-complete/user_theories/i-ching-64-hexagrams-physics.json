  "longDescription": "This theory proposes that the I Ching's 64 hexagrams, DNA's 64 codons, and theoretical physics' 64-component spinor fields all use the same 2⁶ = 64 binary information architecture. The correlation extends to the 72 transformations of Sun Wukong matching Euler characteristic χ=72, and the 3 Realms (Heaven-Earth-Underworld) matching 3 particle generations. The theory acknowledges this likely reflects mathematical universality rather than encoded physics knowledge.",
