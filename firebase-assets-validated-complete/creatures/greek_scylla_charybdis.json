  "importance": 80,
  "popularity": 85,
  "summary": "Scylla and Charybdis are the twin terrors of the strait in Homer's Odyssey, embodying the impossible choice. Scylla is a six-headed monster dwelling in a cliff, snatching sailors from passing ships. Charybdis is a whirlpool that swallows the sea three times daily. Circe advises Odysseus to sail closer to Scylla - losing six men is better than losing the entire ship to Charybdis. The phrase 'between Scylla and Charybdis' has become proverbial for any dilemma with no good option.",
  "description": "Scylla, the six-headed monster, and Charybdis, the deadly whirlpool, guard opposite sides of a narrow strait in Homer's Odyssey. Odysseus must choose between them: sailing near Scylla costs six men to her jaws, while Charybdis would swallow the entire ship. This impossible choice has become proverbial.",
