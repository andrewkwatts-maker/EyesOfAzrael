When Odysseus and his men became trapped in his cave, the giant ate several of them before Odysseus devised his escape. By blinding the Cyclops with a heated stake and calling himself 'Nobody,' Odysseus escaped - but his boast of his true name earned Poseidon's curse that delayed his homecoming for years.",

A shepherd living in a cave, he trapped and devoured Odysseus's men until the hero blinded him with a heated stake.
