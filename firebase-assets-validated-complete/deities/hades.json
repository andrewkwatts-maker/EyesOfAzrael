  "worship": {
    "sacred_sites": "Hades had few temples as Greeks feared to invoke his name. Most worship occurred at necropolises (cities of the dead) or at sites associated with entrances to the underworld , such as caves and deep chasms. The oracle at Epirus consulted the dead through rituals to Hades .",
    "prayers": "Greeks rarely spoke Hades ' name, using epithets like \" Pluto \" (The Wealthy One) to avoid attracting his attention. Prayers typically sought to keep him at bay or to ensure safe passage for the deceased. The dead themselves were invoked through Hades in necromantic rituals.",
    "offerings": "Black animals (sheep, cattle) were sacrificed with their blood poured into the earth. Unlike offerings to Olympian gods, sacrifices to Hades were completely burned or buried rather than shared in feasts. Libations of water, wine, milk, and honey were poured for the dead. Worshippers would avert their faces during Hades ' rituals."
