  "description": "The Sumerian view of the afterlife is stark and sobering. Unlike Egyptian paradise or Greek rewards,\n                Kur (the underworld) offers no hope for joy or reward. All humans—righteous and wicked, rich and\n                poor, king and slave—descend to the same dark realm where they exist as shadows, eating dust and\n                drinking clay water. Death is the great equalizer, and the afterlife is not about judgment or\n                redemption but simply the continuation of diminished existence. Only proper burial and regular\n                offerings from living descendants provide any comfort.",
