  "description": "The Babylonian creation epic describes how the ordered cosmos emerged from primordial waters through\n                divine conflict. Young Marduk defeated the chaos dragon Tiamat, creating heaven and earth from her\n                corpse and humanity from her consort's blood. This mythic battle established Marduk's kingship and\n                the eternal principle: order must be violently wrested from chaos and constantly defended.",
