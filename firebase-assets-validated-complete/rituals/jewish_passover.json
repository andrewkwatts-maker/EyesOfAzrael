  "shortDescription": "Israel's foundational feast commemorating the Exodus - fulfilled in Jesus as the Lamb of God whose blood delivers from death",
  "fullDescription": "Passover (Hebrew: Pesach) is the foundational festival of Jewish identity, commemorating God's deliverance of Israel from Egyptian slavery. The original Passover involved the slaughter of a lamb, the application of its blood to the doorposts so the destroyer would 'pass over' that house, and the eating of the lamb with bitter herbs and unleavened bread. John's Gospel presents Jesus as the ultimate Passover Lamb - slain at the very hour when the Temple lambs were being sacrificed, his bones unbroken according to Passover law, and his blood bringing deliverance not merely from physical slavery but from sin and death. The Last Supper, in John's chronology, occurs before Passover, making Jesus' death the true Passover sacrifice.",

  "content": "# Passover: From Exodus to the Lamb of God\n\n## The Original Passover (Exodus 12)\n\n### The Divine Command\n\n> \"Tell all the congregation of Israel that on the tenth day of this month every man shall take a lamb according to their fathers' houses, a lamb for a household... Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male a year old.\" (Exodus 12:3, 5)\n\n### The Blood Applied\n\n> \"Then they shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses in which they eat it... The blood shall be a sign for you, on the houses where you are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no plague will befall you to destroy you.\" (Exodus 12:7, 13)\n\n### The Meal\n\n> \"They shall eat the flesh that night, roasted on the fire; with unleavened bread and bitter herbs they shall eat it... you shall eat it in haste. It is the LORD's Passover.\" (Exodus 12:8, 11)\n\n## Passover Elements and Symbolism\n\n| Element | Meaning | Johannine Fulfillment |\n|---------|---------|----------------------|\n| Lamb without blemish | Perfect sacrifice | Jesus - the sinless one |\n| Blood on doorposts | Protection from death | Jesus' blood delivers from judgment |\n| Unleavened bread | Haste, purity | Jesus - the bread of life |\n| Bitter herbs | Suffering of slavery | Jesus tastes humanity's bitterness |\n| Hyssop | Application of blood | Hyssop at crucifixion (John 19:29) |\n| Bones unbroken | Integrity of sacrifice | \"Not one bone broken\" (John 19:36) |\n| Eaten in haste | Ready for journey | Faith as immediate response |\n\n## John's Passover Theology\n\n### Three Passovers in John\n\n1. **First Passover** (John 2:13) - Temple cleansing, \"Destroy this temple\"\n2. **Second Passover** (John 6:4) - Feeding 5,000, Bread of Life discourse\n3. **Third Passover** (John 11:55-19:42) - The Passion\n\n### The Lamb of God (John 1:29, 36)\n\n> \"The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, 'Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!'\" (John 1:29)\n\nJohn the Baptist's declaration frames the entire Gospel.\n\n### The Bread of Life (John 6)\n\n> \"I am the bread of life; whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst.\" (John 6:35)\n\nAt Passover time, Jesus:\n- Feeds 5,000 (greater than manna in wilderness)\n- Identifies himself as the true bread from heaven\n- Speaks of eating his flesh and drinking his blood\n- Many disciples leave, unable to accept this teaching\n\n### The True Passover Lamb (John 19)\n\n| Passover Law | Fulfillment in Jesus |\n|--------------|---------------------|\n| Lamb slain on 14 Nisan | Jesus dies on preparation day (19:14) |\n| Slaughtered at 3pm | Jesus dies at the ninth hour |\n| No bones broken (Ex 12:46) | Soldiers don't break his legs (19:33, 36) |\n| Hyssop used | Wine offered on hyssop branch (19:29) |\n| Blood poured out | Blood and water from his side (19:34) |\n\n### \"It is Finished\" (John 19:30)\n\n> \"When Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, 'It is finished,' and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.\"\n\nThe Passover is complete. The final sacrifice has been offered.\n\n## The Seder and Christian Interpretation\n\n### The Four Cups\n\n1. **Cup of Sanctification** - \"I will bring you out\"\n2. **Cup of Deliverance** - \"I will rescue you\"\n3. **Cup of Redemption** - \"I will redeem you\"\n4. **Cup of Praise** - \"I will take you as my people\"\n\nJesus possibly blessed the third cup at the Last Supper: \"This cup is the new covenant in my blood.\"\n\n### The Afikomen\n\nA piece of unleavened bread:\n- Broken\n- Hidden\n- Found and redeemed\n- Shared by all\n\nChristian interpretation: Christ's body broken, buried, risen, shared in communion.\n\n## Typological Connections\n\n### From Egypt to the Cross\n\n```\nEgyptian Slavery → Liberation → Wilderness → Promised Land\n        ↓              ↓           ↓            ↓\nSin & Death    → Redemption → Sanctification → Glory\n```\n\n### The New Exodus\n\nJesus leads a new exodus:\n- Not from Egypt but from sin\n- Not through Red Sea but through death\n- Not to earthly Canaan but to eternal life\n- Not with Moses but with the Son of God\n\n## Liturgical Connections\n\n### The Eucharist as New Passover\n\n> \"For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. Let us therefore celebrate the festival.\" (1 Corinthians 5:7-8)\n\nThe Lord's Supper:\n- Continues Passover themes\n- Celebrates Christ's sacrifice\n- Anticipates the marriage supper of the Lamb\n\n### Easter and Passover\n\nThe resurrection occurs during Passover week:\n- Death on Friday (Passover preparation)\n- Resurrection on Sunday (Firstfruits)\n- The paschal character of Christianity",
