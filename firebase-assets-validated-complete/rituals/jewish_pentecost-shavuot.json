  "fullDescription": "Shavuot (Hebrew: 'Weeks'), known in Greek as Pentecost ('Fiftieth'), is one of the three pilgrimage festivals of ancient Israel. Occurring fifty days after Passover, it originally celebrated the wheat harvest but became associated with the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai. In Acts 2, on the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit descended on the gathered disciples with tongues of fire, and Peter delivered his powerful sermon quoting Joel's prophecy: 'I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh.' This moment marks the birth of the Church and demonstrates how God's Spirit now fulfills what the written Torah pointed toward.",
