  "mythology": "jewish",
  "type": "ritual",
  "description": "The mikveh is a ritual immersion bath used in Judaism for spiritual purification and transformation. Rooted in Torah commandments regarding ritual purity (tumah and taharah), the mikveh requires 'living water' (mayim chayyim) - either a natural body of water or a specially constructed pool connected to rainwater. Immersion in the mikveh marks transitions: from impurity to purity, from single to married, from Gentile to Jew. This ancient practice formed the foundation for Jewish proselyte baptism and influenced John the Baptist's baptism of repentance at the Jordan River.",
