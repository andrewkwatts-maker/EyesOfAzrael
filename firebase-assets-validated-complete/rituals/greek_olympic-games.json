  "description": "The Olympic Games\nwere far more than athletic competitions - they were a sacred festival honoring Zeus, king of the gods,\nheld every four years at his great sanctuary in Olympia. For five days, the Greek world paused in sacred truce (ekecheiria) as athletes,\nspectators, and pilgrims gathered to witness human excellence dedicated to divine glory. The games combined religious ritual, artistic\nperformance, and physical contests, embodying the Greek ideal of kalokagathia\n(beauty and goodness united).",
