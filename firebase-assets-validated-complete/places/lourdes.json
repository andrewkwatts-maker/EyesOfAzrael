  "longDescription": "Lourdes is the second most visited Christian pilgrimage site in the world, after the Vatican. This small town in the French Pyrenees became a global destination after a 14-year-old peasant girl named Bernadette Soubirous reported eighteen apparitions of the Virgin Mary in a grotto called Massabielle. The apparitions occurred between February 11 and July 16, 1858. During the ninth apparition, Bernadette was instructed to dig in the ground, revealing a spring that has since been associated with miraculous healings. The Catholic Church officially recognized the apparitions in 1862, and Bernadette was canonized as Saint Bernadette in 1933.",
