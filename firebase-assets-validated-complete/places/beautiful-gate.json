  "shortDescription": "The magnificent bronze gate of the Jerusalem Temple where Peter and John healed a man lame from birth, declaring 'Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.'",
  "description": "The Beautiful Gate (Greek: hora pulchro, also known as the Gate of Nicanor) was one of the magnificent gates of the Second Temple in Jerusalem, likely located between the Court of the Gentiles and the Court of Women. According to Jewish tradition, this gate was made of Corinthian bronze and exceeded in glory all the other Temple gates. It is most famous in Christian tradition as the site where Peter and John healed a man who had been lame from birth (Acts 3:1-10). This miracle became the occasion for Peter's sermon in Solomon's Porch, where he proclaimed Jesus as the Prophet Moses foretold and the fulfillment of Abraham's blessing.",
  "longDescription": "The Beautiful Gate was one of the most impressive architectural features of Herod's Temple in Jerusalem. According to Josephus, this gate was made of Corinthian bronze and was so heavy that twenty men were needed to open and close it each day. It exceeded all the other Temple gates in splendor - while the other gates were plated with gold and silver, this one's bronze work was considered more valuable.\n\nThe gate stood approximately 75 feet high and 60 feet wide, serving as the main entrance from the Court of the Gentiles into the inner Temple precincts. Some scholars identify it with the Gate of Nicanor, named after a wealthy Jew from Alexandria who donated the bronze doors.\n\nIn Acts 3, Peter and John encountered a man lame from birth who was being carried daily to the Beautiful Gate to beg alms from those entering the Temple. When Peter said, 'Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk,' the man was instantly healed and went into the Temple walking, leaping, and praising God.\n\nThis miracle drew crowds to Solomon's Porch, where Peter preached his second major sermon (after Pentecost). In this sermon, Peter quoted Deuteronomy 18:15-19, identifying Jesus as the Prophet Moses foretold, and connected Jesus to the Abrahamic promise that through Abraham's seed all families of the earth would be blessed.\n\nThe Beautiful Gate thus became a symbol of the continuity between Judaism and the early Church - the Jewish apostles continued worshiping at the Temple while proclaiming Jesus as the fulfillment of Jewish messianic hope. The healing at the gate demonstrated that the power once associated with the Temple now resided in the name of Jesus Christ.",
