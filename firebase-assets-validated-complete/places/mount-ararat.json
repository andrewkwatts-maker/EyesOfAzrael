  "longDescription": "Eastern Turkey (visible from Armenia) Mount Ararat (Turkish: Agri Dagi, Armenian: Masis) is a snow-capped dormant volcano and the highest\n                peak in Turkey, rising 5,137 meters (16,854 feet) near the border with Armenia and Iran. For thousands\n                of years, this majestic twin-peaked mountain has been identified as the resting place of Noah's Ark\n                after the Great Flood - the place where humanity began anew. While the Bible speaks only of the\n                \"mountains of Ararat\" (a region, not a specific peak), tradition has fixed this particular mountain\n                as the site where Noah, his family, and the animals disembarked to repopulate the earth. This\n                identification has made Ararat one of the most symbolically powerful mountains in the Abrahamic traditions.",
