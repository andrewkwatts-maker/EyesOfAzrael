  "summary": "Troy, also called Ilion or Ilium, was the great walled city in Asia Minor whose ten-year siege by the Greeks forms the subject of Homer's Iliad. Founded by the gods and ruled by King Priam, it fell through the stratagem of the Trojan Horse. The city's walls were built by Poseidon and Apollo, making them virtually impregnable - only Odysseus's cunning could breach them. The fall of Troy has resonated through Western literature for three thousand years.",
  "description": "Troy, sacred Ilion, was the great walled city in Asia Minor (modern Turkey) besieged for ten years by the Greeks in the Trojan War. Homer's Iliad takes place during the final year of this siege. The city's walls, built by Poseidon and Apollo, fell only through the deception of the Trojan Horse.",
