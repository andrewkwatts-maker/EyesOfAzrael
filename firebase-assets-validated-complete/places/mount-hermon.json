  "description": "Mount Hermon is the highest peak in the region, rising 2,814 meters (9,232 feet) at the intersection of modern Israel, Syria, and Lebanon. Some scholars identify this as the 'high mountain' of the Transfiguration, as Jesus was near Caesarea Philippi (at Hermon's base) when Peter confessed him as the Christ, just six days before the event.",
  "longDescription": "Mount Hermon (Hebrew: Har Hermon) is the highest mountain in the Anti-Lebanon range, its snow-capped peak visible throughout much of ancient Israel. The mountain was associated with divine presence in ancient Near Eastern traditions and is mentioned numerous times in Scripture. Some scholars argue that Mount Hermon, rather than Mount Tabor, was the actual site of Jesus' Transfiguration, since the Gospels place the event 'six days' after Peter's confession at Caesarea Philippi, which lies at Hermon's southern base. The mountain's great height and proximity to this location support this identification.",

    "arguments": [
      "Jesus was at Caesarea Philippi (at Hermon's base) when Peter confessed him as Christ (Matthew 16:13-20)",
      "The Transfiguration occurred 'six days later' (Matthew 17:1), making nearby Hermon geographically logical",
      "Mount Hermon is genuinely a 'high mountain' (2,814m vs. Tabor's 575m)",
      "The mountain's remote location matches 'apart by themselves'",
      "Ancient pagan associations would make the Transfiguration a dramatic statement of Christ's supremacy"

    "counterArguments": [
      "Mount Tabor has stronger early church tradition (from 4th century)",
      "Tabor's distinctive isolated shape makes it a natural sacred site",
      "The phrase 'high mountain' is relative and could apply to Tabor"
