  "description": "The Jordan River is one of the most sacred waterways in the Abrahamic traditions, flowing from Mount Hermon through the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea. It served as the boundary between wilderness wandering and the Promised Land, parted by God for Joshua and the Israelites to cross. The prophets Elijah and Elisha performed miracles at its waters. Most significantly, John the Baptist conducted his ministry of repentance here, and Jesus was baptized in its waters, making it the site of Christianity's foundational sacrament. The name 'Jordan' (Yarden) means 'the descender' - it drops from 1,800 feet above sea level to 1,400 feet below.",
