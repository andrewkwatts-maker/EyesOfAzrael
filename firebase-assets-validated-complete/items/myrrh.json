  "longDescription": "Myrrh (Hebrew: מֹר mor, meaning 'bitter') is an aromatic gum resin obtained from Commiphora trees native to Arabia and East Africa. In Jewish tradition, myrrh was a primary component of the holy anointing oil (shemen ha-mishchah) used to consecrate priests, kings, and sacred objects. It was also included in the Temple incense (Ketoret). Unlike frankincense's sweet purity, myrrh's bitterness represents self-sacrifice, mortality, and the price of devotion. Myrrh was used in burial preparations, symbolizing death, and in perfumes for celebration, representing the bittersweet nature of human existence before God.",

When used in anointing oil, myrrh marks the person or object as dedicated to God, separate from ordinary use. In Kabbalah, myrrh corresponds to Gevurah (strength/severity) and represents necessary limitation and discipline in spiritual growth. The combination of myrrh with sweet spices in both anointing oil and incense teaches that bitterness and sweetness must be balanced in spiritual life.",

The Egyptians imported myrrh from the Land of Punt (modern-day Somalia/Eritrea region), considering it a divine substance.

The sweet-bitter aroma when burned symbolized the transformation from mortal flesh to divine, eternal spirit. Myrrh's tears (resin drops) were seen as tears of the gods, particularly Ra weeping for humanity, making it sacred and powerful for connecting mortal and divine realms.",
      "culturalSignificance": "The famous Punt expeditions under Queen Hatshepsut (c. 1479-1458 BCE) demonstrated myrrh's extreme value - entire naval expeditions were organized to obtain myrrh trees. Egyptian demand for myrrh drove ancient trade routes connecting Africa to the Mediterranean. The substance was so valuable it was stored in temple treasuries alongside gold. Egyptian embalming techniques using myrrh influenced burial practices throughout the ancient Near East and continue to fascinate modern archaeology.",
