Like other\n                    named swords in Germanic heroic literature, Hrunting possessed its own identity\n                    and reputation, accumulated through generations of martial service.\n                \n                \n                    Hrunting's failure against Grendel's mother is one of the key moments in Beowulf,\n                    demonstrating that even the most proven mortal weapons cannot always prevail\n                    against supernatural evil. Only the giant-forged sword Beowulf finds in the\n                    monster's lair can defeat her.",

Beowulf volunteered to\n                    pursue her to her underwater lair. Before he departed, Unferth - who had earlier\n                    mocked Beowulf's swimming contest with Breca - offered him Hrunting.\n                \n                \n                    This gesture marked a significant character moment for Unferth. By offering his\n                    prized weapon, he acknowledged Beowulf's superiority and sought to contribute\n                    to the hero's success. The poem notes that Unferth had forgotten his earlier\n                    boasts, recognizing now that he himself lacked the courage to face the monster.\n                \n\n                The Failure\n                \n                    In the underwater hall of Grendel's mother, Hrunting failed for the first time\n                    in its long history. Despite its proven edge and venerable reputation, the blade\n                    could not bite into the monster's flesh. The poem suggests that some form of\n                    supernatural protection rendered her invulnerable to mortal weapons.",
