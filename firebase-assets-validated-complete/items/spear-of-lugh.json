When he came to Tara seeking admission to the court, he claimed to\n                    practice every skill, and proved it against all challengers.\n                \n\n                The Second Battle of Mag Tuired\n                \n                    The spear's most famous use was in the Second Battle of Mag Tuired, where the Tuatha De\n                    Danann fought the Fomorians, a race of demonic giants. Lugh led the Tuatha De Danann\n                    forces and, wielding his flaming spear, struck down Balor of the Evil Eye, the terrible\n                    Fomorian king whose gaze could kill armies. With Balor's death, the Fomorians were\n                    broken and driven from Ireland."
