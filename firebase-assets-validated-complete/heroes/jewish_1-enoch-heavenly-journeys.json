  "description": "1 Enoch (Ethiopic Enoch) is a collection of five apocalyptic books attributed to Enoch, the seventh from Adam. The Book of the Watchers (chapters 1-36) describes Enoch's journeys through the cosmos - seeing the ends of earth, the places of punishment and reward, the Tree of Life, and the divine throne. Most significantly, Jude 14-15 directly quotes 1 Enoch 1:9: 'Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of his holy ones, to execute judgment on all.' This New Testament quotation treats 1 Enoch as prophetic scripture. The text also underlies Jude 6's reference to angels 'kept in chains of darkness' - the Watchers whom Enoch condemned. The Astronomical Book (chapters 72-82) reveals the 364-day solar calendar. These heavenly journeys establish Enoch as the archetypal visionary whose cosmic secrets shaped Jewish apocalypticism.",
