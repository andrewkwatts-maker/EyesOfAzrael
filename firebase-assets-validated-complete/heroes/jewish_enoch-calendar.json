  "description": "According to 1 Enoch 72-82 (the Astronomical Book, oldest section of 1 Enoch from 3rd-4th century BCE), the angel Uriel revealed to Enoch the true calendar ordained by God: a 364-day solar year of perfect symmetry. This created profound conflict with the mainstream rabbinic 354-day lunar calendar. The stakes were high: wrong calendar meant celebrating Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles on the wrong days - essentially worshiping God incorrectly. The Dead Sea Scroll community at Qumran followed Enoch's 364-day calendar, separating themselves from the Jerusalem Temple partly over this issue. The Enochic calendar offered perfection: 52 exact weeks, festivals always on the same weekday, priestly courses rotating perfectly. But it required rejecting mainstream Jewish practice. This astronomical controversy reveals that 'walking with God' (as Enoch did) could lead to conflict with established religious authority over seemingly mundane matters - though for the ancients, proper worship timing was anything but mundane.",

  "whyItMatters": "The calendar controversy shows that Enochic tradition represented a competing priestly vision claiming direct heavenly revelation over rabbinic tradition. The 364-day calendar offered order, symmetry, and Sabbath perfection, but required rejecting mainstream Jewish practice. Ultimately, the lunar calendar prevailed in Judaism; the solar calendar survives only in Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity (which preserves 1 Enoch as scripture). The dispute reminds us that 'walking with God' can lead to conflicts with established religion - especially over matters as foundational as when to worship.",
