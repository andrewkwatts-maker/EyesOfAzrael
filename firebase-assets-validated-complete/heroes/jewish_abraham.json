  "description": "Abraham (Avraham Avinu - 'Our Father Abraham') is the foundational patriarch of Israel and the father of the covenant people. God called him from Ur of the Chaldeans to journey to an unknown land, establishing through him an everlasting covenant marked by circumcision and sealed with unconditional promises. Through Abraham's seed, all nations of the earth would be blessed - a promise Matthew's Gospel shows fulfilled in Jesus Christ. Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac (the Akedah) on Mount Moriah prefigures God's sacrifice of His own Son. Matthew opens his Gospel with 'The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham' (Matthew 1:1), placing Jesus squarely within Abraham's covenant line. Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness - establishing the pattern of justification by faith that runs through Scripture from Genesis to Revelation.",
