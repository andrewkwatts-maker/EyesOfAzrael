  "shortDescription": "A minor prophet whose prophecy about the Spirit being 'poured out on all flesh' was quoted by Peter at Pentecost (Acts 2:16-21), marking the birth of the Church.",
  "description": "Joel son of Pethuel was a Jewish prophet whose exact dates are debated, with scholars placing him anywhere from the 9th to the 4th century BCE. His book, though short, contains one of the most significant prophecies in Scripture: the promise that God would pour out His Spirit 'upon all flesh' in the last days. This prophecy from Joel 2:28-32 became central to Peter's Pentecost sermon (Acts 2:16-21), where Peter declared 'This is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel.' Joel's words about sons and daughters prophesying, young men seeing visions, and old men dreaming dreams, with the Spirit poured out even on servants and handmaidens, established the universal and inclusive nature of the Spirit's work in the new covenant era.",
  "longDescription": "Joel son of Pethuel is counted among the twelve Minor Prophets of the Hebrew Bible. Little is known of his personal life beyond his name and his father's name. The Book of Joel uses a devastating locust plague as both historical event and prophetic symbol, calling Israel to repentance and announcing 'the Day of the LORD' - a time of both judgment and salvation.\n\nThe structure of Joel's prophecy moves from crisis (the locust plague) to call (return to the LORD with fasting and weeping) to promise (restoration and the Spirit). The climax of Joel's prophecy is the famous passage in Joel 2:28-32:\n\n'And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions: And also upon the servants and upon the handmaidens in those days will I pour out my spirit. And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke. The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the LORD come. And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD shall be delivered.'\n\nThis prophecy is remarkable for several reasons:\n\n1. **Universality**: The Spirit would come upon 'all flesh' - not just prophets, priests, and kings\n2. **Inclusivity**: Sons AND daughters, young AND old, servants AND handmaidens\n3. **Democratization of Prophecy**: All who receive the Spirit would prophesy, see visions, dream dreams\n4. **Salvation Offer**: 'Whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD shall be delivered'\n\nAt Pentecost, when the disciples received the Holy Spirit and began speaking in tongues, some in the crowd mocked them as drunk. Peter stood up and declared: 'These are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day. But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel' (Acts 2:15-16).\n\nPeter's quotation of Joel established several crucial theological points:\n\n- The 'last days' had begun with the coming of the Messiah and the Spirit\n- The Spirit's outpouring fulfilled ancient prophecy\n- The Gospel invitation was universal: 'whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved' (Acts 2:21)\n- The strange phenomena (tongues, prophecy) were not drunkenness but divine fulfillment\n\nJoel's prophecy also includes imagery that Peter applies to the present age: 'wonders in the heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke: The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and notable day of the Lord come' (Acts 2:19-20). While the ultimate Day of the LORD awaits Christ's return, its preliminary signs have begun.\n\nBeyond the Spirit passage, Joel's book contains other significant themes:\n\n- The locust plague as judgment and symbol of enemy armies\n- The call to genuine repentance ('Rend your heart, and not your garments' - Joel 2:13)\n- The promise of restoration and blessing after repentance\n- The final judgment in the Valley of Jehoshaphat\n- The eternal establishment of Zion\n\nJoel's prophecy demonstrates the continuity between the Jewish prophetic tradition and the birth of the Christian Church. Peter, a Jewish fisherman from Galilee, stood in the Temple precincts on the Jewish festival of Shavuot and declared that the promises given to Israel through the prophets were now being fulfilled in Jesus Christ and the Spirit's coming.",
