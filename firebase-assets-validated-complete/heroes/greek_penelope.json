  "summary": "Penelope, wife of Odysseus and queen of Ithaca, is the archetype of marital fidelity in Western literature. For twenty years - ten of war, ten of wandering - she waited for her husband's return, fending off 108 suitors with cunning to match his own. Her famous stratagem of weaving and unweaving a shroud for Laertes bought her years of time. Her recognition scene with Odysseus, testing him with the secret of their marriage bed, is one of Homer's most moving passages.",
  "description": "Penelope, wise daughter of Icarius, waited twenty years for Odysseus to return from Troy. She held off 108 suitors through her famous trick of weaving by day and unraveling by night. Her cunning matches her husband's, and their reunion after testing each other's identity culminates Homer's Odyssey.",
