  "summary": "Agamemnon, King of Men, led the Greek expedition against Troy as supreme commander. Son of Atreus and brother of Menelaus, his quarrel with Achilles over the war-prize Briseis sets the Iliad's plot in motion. Though powerful and wealthy, Homer portrays him as often foolish and arrogant, sacrificing his daughter Iphigenia for favorable winds and returning home only to be murdered by his wife Clytemnestra.",
  "description": "Agamemnon, wide-ruling King of Mycenae and son of Atreus, commands the Greek forces at Troy. His demand for Achilles' war-prize Briseis ignites the wrath that drives Homer's Iliad. Though 'king of men,' Homer portrays him as prone to error, from sacrificing Iphigenia to dishonoring Achilles.",
