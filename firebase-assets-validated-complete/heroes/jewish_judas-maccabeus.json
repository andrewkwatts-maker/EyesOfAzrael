  "description": "Judas Maccabeus (Hebrew: Yehudah HaMakabi, 'Judah the Hammer') was the third son of the priest Mattathias who led the Jewish revolt against the Seleucid Empire (167-160 BCE). When Antiochus IV Epiphanes desecrated the Temple by sacrificing pigs and erecting a statue of Zeus, Mattathias and his sons ignited a rebellion that combined guerrilla warfare with unwavering zeal for the Torah. Judas emerged as the military commander after his father's death, winning a series of stunning victories against vastly superior Seleucid forces. His recapture and rededication of the Temple in 164 BCE is commemorated in the festival of Hanukkah. For the Zealots of Jesus' time, Judas Maccabeus represented the ideal of armed resistance in defense of God's law - the model they hoped Jesus would follow. Yet Jesus, though called 'Son of David,' proclaimed a kingdom not of this world and conquered through the cross rather than the sword.",
