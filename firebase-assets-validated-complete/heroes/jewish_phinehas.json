  "description": "Phinehas (Hebrew: Pinchas) was the grandson of Aaron the High Priest who became the paradigm of zealous action for God's honor. When Israelite men began worshipping Baal of Peor and taking Midianite women, bringing a plague upon Israel, Phinehas took a spear and killed an Israelite man and his Midianite consort in the very act of their sin. God praised this act, stating that Phinehas 'was zealous with my jealousy among them' and turned back divine wrath from Israel. For this, Phinehas received the 'covenant of peace' and an everlasting priesthood. The Zealots of Jesus' time explicitly claimed Phinehas as their spiritual ancestor, believing that violent action against those who compromised Israel's covenant with God was not merely permitted but praiseworthy. Simon the Zealot would have been raised on this tradition - yet in following Jesus, he had to learn that the new covenant would overcome evil not with the spear but with the cross.",
