  "summary": "Odysseus, man of many ways (polytropos), is the cunning hero of Homer's Odyssey and a key figure in the Iliad. Known for his intelligence rather than brute strength, he devised the Trojan Horse that ended the war. His ten-year journey home to Ithaca - battling monsters, resisting temptations, and longing for wife and homeland - has made 'odyssey' synonymous with epic journey. His reunion with faithful Penelope and slaughter of the suitors culminates the greatest homecoming story ever told.",
  "description": "Odysseus, man of many ways, is the protagonist of Homer's Odyssey. Renowned for his cunning (metis) rather than strength, he devised the Trojan Horse and navigated ten years of adventures returning home. His encounters with Cyclops, Circe, Scylla, Sirens, and Calypso have become archetypal. His faithful return to Penelope embodies the Greek value of nostos (homecoming).",
