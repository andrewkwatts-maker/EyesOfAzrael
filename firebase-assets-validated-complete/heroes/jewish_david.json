  "description": "David, whose name means 'Beloved,' is the greatest king of Israel and the founder of the royal dynasty through which the Messiah would come. Anointed by Samuel while still a shepherd boy in Bethlehem, David rose from slaying Goliath to uniting Israel and establishing Jerusalem as the holy city. God made an unconditional covenant with David (2 Samuel 7) promising that his throne would be established forever - a promise Matthew's Gospel identifies as fulfilled in Jesus Christ. Matthew opens with 'Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham' (1:1), and emphasizes Jesus' Davidic lineage throughout. Jesus is called 'Son of David' more times in Matthew than any other Gospel. The blind men cry out 'Son of David, have mercy on us' (Matthew 9:27, 20:30-31). Jesus enters Jerusalem as the Davidic king on a donkey (Matthew 21:9). David the shepherd-king prefigures Christ the Good Shepherd who lays down his life for the sheep.",
