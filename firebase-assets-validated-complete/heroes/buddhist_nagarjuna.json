His revolutionary teachings on emptiness (shunyata) and his masterwork, the Mulamadhyamakakarika , profoundly influenced all subsequent Buddhist thought. Considered an emanation of Manjushri , he is revered as the \"Second Buddha\" for reviving and clarifying the Buddha 's teachings.

I prostrate to the Perfect Buddha, the supreme among teachers, who taught dependent origination: no cessation, no arising; no annihilation, no permanence; no coming, no going; no distinction, no unity; peaceful of fabrications, at peace.\" Source: Mulamadhyamakakarika by Nagarjuna, opening dedication, c. 2nd century CE Mulamadhyamakakarika:Chapter 24:Verses 18-19 \"Whatever is dependently co-arisen, that is explained to be emptiness. That, being a dependent designation, is itself the middle way. Something that is not dependently arisen, such a thing does not exist. Therefore a non-empty thing does not exist.\" Source: MMK, Chapter 24, defining emptiness as dependent origination Mulamadhyamakakarika:Chapter 25:Verse 24 \"The nature of the Tathagata is the nature of the world. The Tathagata has no intrinsic nature; the world has no intrinsic nature.\" Source: MMK, Chapter 25, on the emptiness of nirvana and samsara Vigrahavyavartani (Dispeller of Objections) Vigrahavyavartani:Verses 1-4 \"If all things are empty, there is no arising and no passing away. The Four Noble Truths do not exist. If the Noble Truths do not exist, then understanding, abandoning, realizing, and practicing do not exist. This is the opponent's objection. My response: You do not understand the purpose of emptiness, emptiness itself, and the meaning of emptiness. Therefore you create this objection.\" Source: Vigrahavyavartani by Nagarjuna, refuting objections to emptiness teaching Ratnavali (Precious Garland) Ratnavali:Chapter 1:Verses 47-49 \"Just as 'chariot' is labeled depending on a collection of parts, so conventionally a 'being' exists depending on the aggregates. The aggregates are not the self, nor do they belong to a self. Yet the self is not separate from them. This is the inexpressible nature. Not permanent, not annihilated, not the same, not different—this is the Buddha 's teaching to those who are receptive.\" Source: Ratnavali (Precious Garland) by Nagarjuna, letter to King Gautamiputra, c. 2nd century CE Ratnavali:Chapter 2:Verses 1-4 \"O King, as long as the aggregates are grasped, so long does the idea of 'I' prevail. When the idea of 'I' prevails, there is action, and from action comes rebirth. With cessation of the conception of 'I' through the knowledge that it is without basis, action ceases and there is liberation.\" Source: Ratnavali, Chapter 2, on liberation through understanding emptiness of self Sutrasamuccaya (Compendium of Sutras) Sutrasamuccaya:Opening Statement \"The Perfection of Wisdom is called 'mother of the Buddhas' because it gives birth to all Buddhas of the three times. Without understanding emptiness, there is no path to enlightenment. Yet emptiness wrongly understood becomes poison rather than medicine—those who grasp at emptiness as an absolute fall into a deeper abyss than those who grasp at existence.\" Source: Sutrasamuccaya by Nagarjuna, compilation of Mahayana sutra passages Traditional Biographies Nagarjuna's Life:Taranatha's History:Chapter 7 \"The nagas , recognizing Nagarjuna's realization, brought him to their underwater palace where countless volumes of the Prajnaparamita sutras were preserved. The naga king said: 'These teachings are too profound for ordinary beings. The Buddha entrusted them to us until one arose with the capacity to understand and teach them.' Nagarjuna studied the hundred thousand, twenty thousand, and eight thousand line versions of the Perfection of Wisdom, then returned to teach humanity.\" Source: History of Buddhism in India by Taranatha, Tibet, 17th century CE",
