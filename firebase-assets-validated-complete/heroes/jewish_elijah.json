  "description": "Elijah the Prophet was one of the greatest prophets of Israel, known for his fiery zeal for YHWH and his miraculous ministry during the reign of King Ahab. He confronted the prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel, was fed by ravens, raised the dead, and was taken to heaven in a chariot of fire without experiencing death. According to Malachi 4:5-6, Elijah would return before 'the great and dreadful day of the LORD' to turn the hearts of fathers to children. Jewish tradition sees him as the herald of the Messiah, and he appears at every Passover seder and circumcision. Jesus identified John the Baptist as Elijah who was to come.",
