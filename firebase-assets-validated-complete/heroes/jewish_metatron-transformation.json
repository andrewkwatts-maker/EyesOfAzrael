  "description": "3 Enoch (Sefer Hekhalot) describes Rabbi Ishmael's ascent through seven heavenly halls where he meets Metatron, who reveals: 'I am Enoch, son of Jared.' The text describes Enoch's complete transformation from mortal human to the greatest of all angels. God enlarged his body to cosmic proportions, gave him 72 wings and 365,000 eyes, transformed his flesh into blazing fire, enthroned him at the entrance to the seventh heaven, and crowned him with the Divine Name itself. Metatron is called 'Lesser YHWH' - bearing God's own name - based on Exodus 23:21. This radical claim of a human becoming divine-like sparked the 'two powers in heaven' controversy: when Aher (Elisha ben Abuyah) saw Metatron seated, he concluded there were two divine powers, becoming an apostate. Metatron was punished with 60 fiery lashes to demonstrate his subordination. The Metatron tradition represents the extreme limit of human transformation while carefully maintaining monotheism - he is 'Lesser YHWH,' not YHWH himself.",

  "theologicalSignificance": "Metatron represents the ultimate human potential - complete theosis (deification) within Jewish mystical thought. A mortal becomes cosmic, fiery, enthroned, bearing God's very Name. Yet the tradition carefully maintains his subordination: he can be punished, he serves rather than rules, he is 'Lesser YHWH' not YHWH himself. This tension reflects Judaism's struggle to express mystical experience within strict monotheism. Enoch-Metatron becomes the bridge between human and divine - proof that 'walking with God' can lead to transformation beyond imagination, yet without collapsing the Creator-creature distinction.",
