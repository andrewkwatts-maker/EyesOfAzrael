  "summary": "Achilles, swift-footed son of Peleus and the sea-nymph Thetis, stands as the greatest warrior of the Trojan War and central figure of Homer's Iliad. His wrath (menis) against Agamemnon drives the epic's plot, and his choice of a short, glorious life over a long, obscure one embodies the Greek heroic ideal. The Iliad begins with his anger and ends with the funeral of his enemy Hector, whom he slew in vengeance for Patroclus.",
  "description": "Swift-footed Achilles, son of Peleus and Thetis, is the central hero of Homer's Iliad. His divine mother dipped him in the River Styx to make him invulnerable, but held him by the heel - his one mortal weakness. His wrath against Agamemnon and grief for Patroclus drive the action of the greatest Greek epic.",
