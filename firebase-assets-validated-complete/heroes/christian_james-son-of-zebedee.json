Along with his brother John, Jesus gave him the Aramaic nickname 'Boanerges' (Sons of Thunder), perhaps reflecting his zealous temperament. James was the first of the Twelve Apostles to be martyred, killed by King Herod Agrippa I around 44 CE - fulfilling Jesus' prophecy that James would 'drink his cup.' His witness to the Transfiguration prepared him for martyrdom: having seen Christ's divine glory, he could face death with confidence.",
