  "summary": "Hector, tamer of horses, eldest son of Priam and Hecuba, stands as Troy's greatest champion and the noblest figure in Homer's Iliad. Unlike the wrathful Achilles, Hector embodies civic duty, fighting not for glory but for his city, his parents, and his family. His farewell to Andromache and infant Astyanax remains one of literature's most poignant scenes. His death at Achilles' hands and Priam's ransom of his body conclude the Iliad.",
  "description": "Hector, tamer of horses, is the greatest warrior of Troy and son of King Priam. In Homer's Iliad, he defends his city against the Greek invasion, kills Patroclus, and falls to Achilles in their final duel. His nobility, love for family, and sense of duty make him the most sympathetic figure on either side of the war.",
