  "summary": "Paris, also called Alexander, is the Trojan prince whose abduction of Helen sparked the Trojan War. Son of Priam and Hecuba, he was chosen by Zeus to judge which goddess - Hera, Athena, or Aphrodite - was fairest. He chose Aphrodite, who promised him the most beautiful woman in the world. In Homer's Iliad, he appears as a skilled archer but reluctant warrior, scorned by Hector yet protected by Aphrodite. He ultimately slays Achilles with an arrow guided by Apollo.",
  "description": "Paris, prince of Troy and son of Priam, judged the beauty contest between Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite, choosing Aphrodite and winning Helen of Sparta. In Homer's Iliad, he is portrayed as more lover than warrior, skilled with the bow but avoiding close combat. Apollo guides his arrow to slay the invincible Achilles.",
