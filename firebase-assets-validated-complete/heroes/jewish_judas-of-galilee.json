  "description": "Judas of Galilee (also called Judas the Gaulonite) was the founder of what the Jewish historian Josephus called the 'Fourth Philosophy' - a revolutionary movement that later became known as the Zealots. In 6 CE, when the Romans conducted a census under Quirinius to assess taxation, Judas led a revolt declaring that paying tribute to Rome was apostasy since it acknowledged Caesar rather than God as Israel's true Lord. His rallying cry 'No lord but God' encapsulated a theology of radical resistance that would eventually lead to the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE. Gamaliel mentions Judas in Acts 5:37 as an example of failed messianic movements. The Zealot movement that Simon the Zealot joined traced its ideological roots directly to Judas. Jesus' ministry took place in this same Galilean context of revolutionary fervor, yet he proclaimed a radically different kind of kingdom.",
