  "description": "John the Baptist was a Jewish prophet who emerged from the Judean wilderness proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. As the son of the priest Zechariah and Elizabeth, he was consecrated as a Nazirite from birth. He came 'in the spirit and power of Elijah' to prepare the way for the Messiah, calling Israel to repentance at the Jordan River. His prophetic innovation of immersion baptism drew upon Jewish mikveh traditions while adding an eschatological dimension of preparation for the coming Kingdom. Andrew was among John's disciples before following Jesus.",
