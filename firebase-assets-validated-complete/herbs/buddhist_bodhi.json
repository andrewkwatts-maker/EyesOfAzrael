Under this sacred fig tree (Ficus religiosa) in Bodh Gaya, India, the Buddha sat in meditation for 49 days, achieved perfect enlightenment, and comprehended the Four Noble Truths and the path to liberation from suffering. Sanskrit Names: Bodhi Vriksha (बोधि वृक्ष), Bodhidruma, Pippala Scientific Name: Ficus religiosa L. (Sacred Fig, Peepal Tree) Symbol: Enlightenment, awakening, spiritual refuge, Buddhist path The Great Enlightenment (Bodhi) The Buddha's Awakening Under the Tree In approximately 528 BCE, at the age of 35, Prince Siddhartha Gautama sat beneath a large Ficus religiosa tree in what is now Bodh Gaya, Bihar, India. After six years of extreme ascetic practices and finding the Middle Way, he made a momentous vow: \"I will not rise from this seat until I have attained the supreme and absolute wisdom.\" — Traditional account of the Buddha's vow The 49 Days of Meditation The Seat: Sat cross-legged on a grass mat facing east First Watch (Evening): Attained knowledge of his previous lives Second Watch (Midnight): Attained divine eye, saw the cycle of death and rebirth Third Watch (Pre-Dawn): Comprehended the Four Noble Truths Dawn of Full Moon: Achieved complete enlightenment (Bodhi) Mara's Assault: Defeated the demon Mara's temptations and attacks Earth Witness: Called Earth Goddess to witness his right to enlightenment Seven Weeks After: Remained near the tree contemplating his realization What Was Realized Four Noble Truths: The truth of suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path Dependent Origination: The twelve links of causation binding beings to samsara Three Marks of Existence: Impermanence (anicca), suffering (dukkha), non-self (anatta) Eightfold Path: The practical way to end suffering Nirvana: The state beyond suffering, the unconditioned reality Universal Liberation: All beings can achieve enlightenment Transformation of the Tree The moment of Buddha's enlightenment transformed an ordinary Ficus religiosa into the eternal Bodhi Tree , making it the axis mundi of Buddhism—the center of the spiritual universe where ultimate truth was revealed. From that moment, every Ficus religiosa became sacred, and cuttings from the original tree became objects of veneration. Sacred Texts and Scriptural References Jataka Tales (Previous Lives of Buddha) \"In former births, when I was a Bodhisattva pursuing the path, I made offerings to this very tree, knowing that beneath it I would one day achieve supreme enlightenment.\" Buddhavamsa (Chronicle of Buddhas) \"Each of the 28 Buddhas before me attained enlightenment under a Bodhi tree. This sacred tree witnesses the awakening of all who reach perfect wisdom.\" Key Buddhist Texts Mentioning the Bodhi Tree Pali Canon: Extensive accounts in Vinaya and Sutta Pitaka Nidana Katha: Detailed story of the Buddha's enlightenment Buddhacarita: Ashvaghosha's epic poem of Buddha's life Mahavamsa: Sri Lankan chronicle describing Bodhi tree sapling's journey Lalitavistara Sutra: Mahayana account of Buddha's life and awakening Jataka Commentary: Stories connecting Buddha to the tree in past lives The Seven Weeks After Enlightenment Buddhist texts describe Buddha's activities in the seven weeks following his awakening: Week One: Sat under Bodhi tree in meditation bliss Week Two: Stood gazing at tree with unwinking eyes for a week (Animisa stupa marks this spot) Week Three: Walked back and forth between tree and meditation spot (Jewel Walk) Week Four: Meditated in jeweled chamber created by gods Week Five: Sat under Ajapala Nigrodha tree where Mara's daughters tempted him Week Six: Sat beneath Mucalinda tree where serpent king protected him from storm Week Seven: Sat under Rajayatana tree where merchants made first offerings Mahayana and Vajrayana Perspectives Pure Land Texts: Amitabha's Pure Land contains wish-fulfilling Bodhi trees Avatamsaka Sutra: Describes cosmic Bodhi tree reaching all realms Tibetan Traditions: Bodhi tree appears in many thangka paintings and mandalas Zen/Chan: \"The Bodhi tree doesn't exist, where can dust alight?\" (Huineng's poem) Pilgrimage Sites and Sacred Trees The Original Bodhi Tree - Bodh Gaya, India Location: Bodh Gaya, Bihar, India (UNESCO World Heritage Site) The original tree witnessed the Buddha's enlightenment around 528 BCE. Though the current tree is not the original (which was destroyed multiple times throughout history), it is believed to be a direct descendant through continuous replanting from cuttings.
