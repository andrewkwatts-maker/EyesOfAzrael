  "longDescription": "Chaos Magic is a contemporary magical practice that emerged in England in the 1970s, emphasizing pragmatic techniques over specific traditions or belief systems. Chaos magicians treat belief itself as a tool, adopting and discarding belief systems as needed. The practice focuses on achieving tangible results through sigilization, servitor creation, and gnosis states.",
