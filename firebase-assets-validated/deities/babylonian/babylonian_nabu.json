    "htmlTextContent": "Babylonian - Nabu 📜 Nabu Home → Babylonian → Deities → Nabu 📜 Nabu Divine Scribe, God of Wisdom and Writing Patron deity of scribes, scholars, and wisdom. Keeper of the Tablet of Destinies , recorder of divine decrees , and son of Marduk . Nabu embodies knowledge, prophecy, and the power of the written word to shape reality and preserve truth across time. Attributes &amp; Domains Loading attributes from Firebase... Mythology &amp; Stories Nabu 's prominence grew throughout the first millennium BCE, eventually rivaling his father Marduk in some periods. His cult emphasized literacy, learning, and the preservation of knowledge as sacred acts. Key Myths : Loading myths from Firebase... Sources: Nabu hymns from Borsippa, references in Enuma Elish , Akitu festival texts, astronomical diaries invoking Nabu , colophons (scribal notes) on cuneiform tablets praising Nabu Relationships Family Parents: Marduk (king of gods) and Sarpanit Consort(s): Tašmetu (also called Tašmētum), goddess of hearing and favor Children: Various minor deities in later traditions Siblings: Various divine offspring of Marduk Allies &amp; Enemies Allies: Marduk (father and king), Shamash (god of justice - both value truth), the entire scribal profession Enemies: Forces of chaos and ignorance, those who would destroy written records Worship &amp; Rituals Sacred Sites Nabu 's primary temple was the Ezida (\"True House\") at Borsippa, near Babylon. The temple complex included a major ziggurat and extensive libraries where cuneiform tablets were copied, studied, and preserved. He also had temples in Nineveh, Nimrud, and throughout Mesopotamia. These temples functioned as scribal schools where young men learned the complex art of cuneiform writing under Nabu 's patronage. Every temple library was considered under Nabu 's protection. Festivals Akitu Procession: During the New Year festival , Nabu 's statue journeyed from Borsippa to Babylon in an elaborate river procession. Crowds lined the route, and upon arrival, Nabu \"inscribed\" the fates for the coming year. This ritual emphasized the renewal of cosmic order through divine writing. Scribal Graduation Ceremonies: When apprentice scribes completed their training, they made offerings to Nabu , dedicating their first independent work to the god. This initiated them into the professional scribal class under divine patronage. Offerings Offerings to Nabu included fresh water (for mixing clay), styluses and writing tools, clay tablets inscribed with prayers, grain and dates (connecting writing to agriculture), incense (especially cedar), and the firstfruits of scribal work. Scholars dedicated copied texts to Nabu , with colophons praising the god and requesting his blessing on the work. Kings who commissioned libraries or renovated scribal schools made grand offerings to Nabu . Prayers &amp; Invocations Scribes invoked Nabu daily before beginning work: \"O Nabu , lord of the stylus, open my understanding, guide my hand, grant me precision!\" Students prayed for clarity of mind and retention of lessons. Diviners sought Nabu 's aid in correctly interpreting omens. Typical prayer structure praised Nabu 's wisdom, requested specific assistance, and promised faithful service in return. Many cuneiform tablets end with \"Praise to Nabu !\" as a scribal signature. The Scribal Profession To be a scribe in ancient Mesopotamia was to serve Nabu directly. The profession was hereditary and highly respected, as literacy was rare and powerful. Scribes underwent years of rigorous training in the \"tablet house\" (edubba), learning thousands of cuneiform signs, mathematical calculations, legal formulas, medical texts, and religious hymns. They were essential to administration, commerce, law, religion, and the preservation of culture itself. Royal scribes recorded kings' deeds, temple scribes maintained ritual calendars and divination records, merchant scribes tracked trade, and scholarly scribes copied ancient texts . All worked under Nabu 's patronage, and the god's favor was seen as essential to accurate, clear writing. Scribal colophons often invoked curses (through Nabu ) on anyone who would damage or steal tablets.
