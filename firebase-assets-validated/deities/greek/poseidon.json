    "prayers": "Poseidon was invoked as \" Ennosigaios \" ( Earth-Shaker ) when seeking protection from earthquakes and as \"Soter\" (Savior) for safe sea travel. Prayers were typically offered at the shore or from ship decks, with outstretched arms toward the sea. Before major voyages, captains sacrificed at his temples and promised greater offerings upon successful return. Coastal peoples prayed for protection from tsunamis and sea raiders, while horse-tamers and charioteers sought his blessing at hippodromes.",
    "sacred_sites": "Poseidon was worshipped throughout the Greek world, especially in coastal cities and islands. His most famous temple stood at Cape Sounion , perched dramatically on cliffs overlooking the Aegean Sea, where sailors offered prayers for safe voyages. The sanctuary at Corinth (Isthmia) hosted the Isthmian Games in his honor. Other major cult centers included Helike (destroyed by earthquake and tsunami in 373 BCE, seen as divine punishment), Onchestos, Tainaron (with a legendary entrance to the underworld ), and temples throughout the Peloponnese.",
    "offerings": "Sailors poured libations of wine into the sea before voyages and offered thanksgiving sacrifices upon safe return. Black bulls and stallions were particularly sacred offerings to Poseidon , sometimes drowned in the sea rather than burned on altars. Fishermen offered first catches, and coastal cities held regular processions to his shrines. Pine branches, sea salt, and water were used in purification rituals. After safe voyages, sailors dedicated votive anchors, ship models, and oars at his temples.",
    "festivals": [
      "Isthmian Games: Held every two years at the Isthmus of Corinth in honor of Poseidon . One of the four pan-Hellenic games, athletes competed for crowns of pine (later wild celery). The games featured chariot racing, reflecting Poseidon 's association with horses, alongside athletic contests and musical competitions.",
      "Poseidonia: Festivals celebrated throughout Greek cities, particularly in winter when seafaring was most dangerous. Sacrifices ensured calm seas for the coming sailing season.",
      "Poseideion: The month named after Poseidon (roughly December), when rites were performed seeking his favor for the year ahead."
