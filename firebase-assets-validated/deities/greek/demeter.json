  "worship": {
    "offerings": "First fruits of the harvest were always dedicated to Demeter . Offerings included grain, barley cakes, honey cakes, and libations of milk, honey, and wine. Pigs were her primary sacrificial animal, especially at the Thesmophoria (piglets were thrown into sacred pits and later retrieved, their remains mixed with seeds). Torches featured prominently in her rites, recalling her search for Persephone . Poppies were offered both for their connection to sleep/death and their growth among grain fields.",
    "festivals": [
      "Eleusinian Mysteries: The greatest and most secret religious rites of ancient Greece, held annually in autumn. Lesser Mysteries in spring prepared initiates; Greater Mysteries in fall revealed sacred knowledge about death, rebirth, and the afterlife. Initiates processed from Athens to Eleusis, fasted, drank the kykeon (ritual drink), and witnessed sacred dramas revealing divine secrets.",
      "Thesmophoria: Women-only autumn festival celebrating Demeter Thesmophoros (Lawgiver). Women left their homes, built temporary shelters, performed purification rites, and celebrated female solidarity while ensuring agricultural fertility for the coming year.",
      "Haloa: Winter festival celebrating the threshing of grain, featuring ribald humor, cakes shaped like genitals, and women-only feasting, honoring Demeter , Persephone , and Dionysus .",
      "Proerosia: Pre-plowing festival in autumn, asking Demeter 's blessing before sowing the year's grain crop."
    ],
    "prayers": "Farmers invoked Demeter before plowing and sowing, and gave thanks at harvest. Prayers emphasized her role as sustainer of life and protector of social order. Women called upon her in matters of fertility, childbirth, and family welfare. Initiates of the Mysteries invoked her for spiritual understanding and hope for a blessed afterlife. The kykeon ritual drink was prepared and consumed in her honor during the Mysteries.",
    "sacred_sites": "Eleusis, near Athens, was Demeter 's primary cult center and home of the Eleusinian Mysteries. The sanctuary complex included the Telesterion (hall of initiation) where the secret rites were performed. Major temples also existed on Sicily (where Persephone was said to have been abducted), Hermione, Thebes, and throughout the Greek world. Rural shrines marked the boundaries of cultivated fields."
