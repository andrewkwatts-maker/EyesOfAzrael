Hewasalso worshipped at necropolis sites throughout Egypt, particularly atAbydos, Memphis, and Thebes. Every tomb and embalming workshopwasconsidered sacred toAnubis, and his priests (called \"Imy-ut\" or \"He who is in the place of embalming\") performed funerary rites. The Festival of Wag:Celebrated during the first month of the flood season, honoring the dead with offerings and processionals to tombs.Anubisreceived special offerings as guardian of the necropolis. Opening of the Mouth Ceremony:Performed on mummies and tomb statues, this ritual reanimated the deceased's senses.Anubispriests presided, using ritual instruments to symbolically open the mouth, eyes, and ears of the dead. Offerings toAnubisincluded: myrrh and frankincense (embalming materials), natron (purification salt), linen bandages, black dogs or jackals (symbolic), bread and beer, ox meat, incense. Offerings were placed at tomb entrances and in funerary temples, asking forAnubis's protection of the deceased and safe passage through theunderworld. Prayers toAnubisemphasized his protective role:\"Homage to you,Anubis, who dwells in the embalming chamber. Grant that I may enter the Hall of Two Truths with a pure heart. Guard my body in the sacred land. Lead me safely through the passages of theDuat. Let your hand be upon me in the hour of judgment. May I stand justified beforeOsiris, my heart lighter than the feather ofMa'at.\" Embalmers invoked:\"Anubis, Lord of Secrets, guide my hands in this sacred work. Preserve this flesh that thebamay return. Purify this body that it may be worthy of eternallife. As you preservedOsiris, so preserve this servant of the gods.\"",
    "mythology": "Anubis's mythology centers on death, preservation, and judgment. As one of the oldest gods in the Egyptian pantheon, his role evolved from lord of the dead to psychopomp and guardian of mummification secrets."
