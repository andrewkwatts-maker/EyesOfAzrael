    "Apollo and Daphne: When Apollo mocked Cupid's archery, the god of love took revenge. He shot Apollo with a golden arrow, causing him to fall desperately in love with the nymph Daphne. He shot Daphne with a lead arrow, filling her with aversion. Daphne fled and was transformed into a laurel tree to escape Apollo's pursuit (Ovid, Metamorphoses I).",
    "The Arrows of Love: Cupid possesses two types of arrows: golden-tipped arrows kindle irresistible passion, while lead-tipped arrows cause disgust and flight from love. Even Jupiter is not immune to Cupid's power—many of his famous affairs were sparked by Cupid's intervention.",
    "The Blindfolded God: Later traditions depicted Cupid blindfolded, representing that love is blind and strikes without regard for social standing, wisdom, or consequence. This image influenced the Renaissance and modern depictions of \"blind love.\"",
    "Venus's Weapon: As Venus 's son and constant companion, Cupid often acted as her instrument, inflaming passion to reward devotees or punish those who offended her.",
    "Mother: Venus (most common tradition)",
    "Father: Mars (most common tradition), or Mercury , or Vulcan (various accounts)",
    "Wife: Psyche (Soul), the mortal princess made divine",
    "Daughter: Voluptas (Pleasure), born to Cupid and Psyche",
    "Siblings: Anteros (Requited Love), Himeros (Longing), Pothos (Yearning) - the Erotes",
    "Weddings: Cupid blessed marriages and was invoked at wedding ceremonies for lasting love",
    "Lupercalia (February 15): This fertility festival, later associated with Valentine's Day, had connections to love's divine power",
    "Venus Festivals: Cupid was honored alongside his mother during the Veneralia (April 1) and other Venus celebrations",
    "Dual Arrows: The Roman tradition of golden and leaden arrows (love and aversion) is more developed than in Greek sources",
    "Psyche Tale: The elaborate Cupid and Psyche narrative is a Roman literary creation (Apuleius), not found in Greek myth",
    "Mischievous Child: Roman art and poetry often emphasized Cupid as a playful, naughty child-god, while Greek Eros could be a powerful primordial force",
    "Venus's Agent: Roman sources frequently depict Cupid as Venus's obedient (or disobedient) son and tool, less as an independent cosmic power",
    "Blindfolded Love: The image of blind Cupid became particularly prominent in Roman and later European tradition",
    "Elegiac Poetry: Roman love poets (Ovid, Propertius, Tibullus) made Cupid a central figure in their amatory verse"
