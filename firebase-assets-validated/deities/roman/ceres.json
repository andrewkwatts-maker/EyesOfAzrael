    "Fox Statues (Komainu): Pairs of fox statues flank Inari shrine entrances, typically holding symbolic objects - rice sheaves, keys, jewels, or scrolls in their mouths or under their paws.",
    "Rice Granary Guardians: Foxes were historically seen as protectors of rice granaries because they hunt rats and mice that would otherwise eat stored grain, making them practical as well as symbolic guardians.",
    "Intelligence   Magic: Kitsune represent cleverness, wisdom, and supernatural power. The longer a fox lives, the more tails it grows and the more powerful it becomes (up to nine tails).",
    "Shapeshifters: Fox spirits can transform into human form, especially beautiful women, and this shapeshifting ability links them to transformation and change - essential agricultural concepts (seed to plant, harvest to food).",
    "Agricultural Deity: Likely originated as a local agricultural kami worshipped by farming communities dependent on rice cultivation. The name \"Inari\" directly relates to rice growing/ripening.",
    "Syncretism: May be a syncretic fusion of multiple earlier rice and fertility deities including Uke-Mochi (killed by Tsukuyomi, from whose body came rice), Toyouke-Hime, or Ukanomitama-no-Kami.",
    "Hata Clan Origins: Tradition associates Inari worship with the Hata clan, Korean immigrants who brought advanced agricultural and silk production techniques to Japan in the 5th-6th centuries.",
    "Mountain Deity: Fushimi Inari (the head shrine) sits on Mount Inari, suggesting possible origins as a mountain kami who descended to bless the rice fields in the valleys.",
    "Buddhist Influence: During the medieval period, Inari was sometimes identified with Buddhist figures, especially Dakini-ten (a tantric deity), adding layers of complexity and esoteric meaning.",
    "Red Torii Gates: Vermillion torii gates (often in long tunnels or rows) mark Inari shrines. Donors contribute these gates as offerings when wishes are granted.",
    "Fox Statues: Pairs of fox guardians (sometimes holding rice, keys, or jewels) flank shrine entrances and dot the grounds.",
    "Mountain Location: Many Inari shrines sit on or near mountains, with pilgrimage paths marked by countless torii gates.",
    "Business Shrines: Small Inari shrines appear on rooftops and in businesses, especially in merchant districts, seeking prosperity.",
    "Hatsu-Uma Festival (First Horse Day): Held on the first horse day of February (Inari's traditional descent date), this is the most important Inari festival celebrating the kami's blessing of crops.",
    "Inari Matsuri: Various local festivals throughout the year, especially at planting and harvest times.",
