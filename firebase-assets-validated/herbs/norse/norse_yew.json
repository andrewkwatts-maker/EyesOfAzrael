Contains taxine alkaloids that cause cardiac arrest. As little as 50-100g of needles can kill an adult human. Death can occur within 2-5 hours of ingestion with minimal symptoms beforehand. There is NO ANTIDOTE. TOXIC PARTS: Needles, bark, seeds, wood. Only the red aril (berry flesh) is non-toxic, but the seed inside is deadly. SYMPTOMS: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, difficulty breathing, irregular heartbeat, sudden cardiac arrest. This page is for HISTORICAL and MYTHOLOGICAL study ONLY. Yew - Guardian of the Threshold The yew tree (Taxus baccata) stands as one of the most paradoxical plants in Norse tradition - simultaneously the wood of life (bows, rune staves) and the harbinger of death (deadly poison). Sacred to Ullr the archer-god and Odin the death-walker, the yew bridges the worlds of the living and the dead, embodying transformation, protection, and the eternal cycle of death and rebirth. Norse Name: Ýr (Old Norse) | Rune Association: Eihwaz (ᛇ) - Yew rune Botanical: Taxus baccata (European Yew), Taxus brevifolia (Pacific Yew) Mythological Connections Sacred to Ullr - The Archer God Ullr (Old Norse: \"Glory\"), the god of archery, skiing, hunting, and single combat, is intimately connected with the yew tree. Yew wood was the premium material for crafting powerful longbows throughout Northern Europe. Divine Craftsmanship: Ullr's legendary bow was said to be made of yew, never missing its mark Oath Ring: Ullr's sacred oath ring was possibly made of yew wood Winter God: Ullr ruled during winter months when Odin wandered - yew being evergreen symbolized continuity Shield-God: Yew wood shields were favored for their flexibility and strength Invocation: Warriors would invoke Ullr before archery contests and hunts → Learn more about Ullr Sacred to Odin - The Death-Walker Odin , the All-Father, god of wisdom, death, and magic, held the yew sacred as a threshold plant - a guardian between life and death, this world and the next. Death & Resurrection: Yew's toxicity connects to Odin's shamanic death experiences Rune Magic: Yew wood was the preferred material for crafting rune staves Yggdrasil Connection: Some scholars suggest yew may have been one of Yggdrasil's forms Otherworld Gateway: Yew groves were sites for seiðr (Norse shamanic practice) Wisdom Through Death: Odin's hanged sacrifice parallels the yew's death symbolism → Learn more about Odin The Eihwaz Rune (ᛇ) The thirteenth rune of the Elder Futhark, Eihwaz (also Ihwaz, Eoh), directly represents the yew tree and embodies its paradoxical nature. Meaning: Yew tree, endurance, death/rebirth, defense, protection Symbolism: Vertical axis connecting worlds, spine of the cosmos Magical Use: Protection, banishing, initiation, shamanic journeying Divination: Transformation through crisis, necessary endings, spiritual death/rebirth Shape Significance: Vertical line suggesting World Tree axis, or bow stave Yew in Norse Cosmology Immortality Symbol: Yew trees can live 2,000+ years, symbolizing eternal life Regeneration: Yew branches can root and become new trunks, suggesting rebirth Cemetery Guardian: Yews planted in graveyards protected the dead and purified the ground Threshold Guardian: Yew marked sacred boundaries and liminal spaces World Tree Candidate: Some theories suggest Yggdrasil may have been a yew, not ash Viking Age Warfare Longbows: English longbows (used against Vikings) were made from yew Norse Bows: Archaeological finds show Vikings used yew for composite and self bows Tactical Value: Yew's elasticity and compression strength made it ideal for bows Sacred Weapon: Bows were not just tools but sacred objects blessed by Ullr Ritual Significance: Breaking a yew bow signified dishonor or oath-breaking Historical Uses in Norse Tradition Rune Stave Crafting Traditional Method: Wood Selection: Choose yew branch during specific moon phase (waning moon for banishing, waxing for growth) Ritual Cutting: Cut with intention, leave offering (mead, bread, silver) Seasoning: Dry wood for full lunar cycle (28 days minimum) Carving: Carve runes with iron or bronze tool, never steel Coloring: Traditional sources mention coloring runes with blood (symbolic or actual) Activation: \"Wake\" the runes through breath, chanting, or galdr (rune songs) Uses: Divination, spell casting, protection talismans, bind runes Bow and Weapon Crafting Longbow Construction: 6-foot staves from straight-grained yew heartwood Seasoning Time: Minimum 1-2 years of drying required Blessing Ritual: Bows consecrated to Ullr with offerings and oaths Naming: Important bows given names (kennings), treated as living allies Burial Practice: Warriors sometimes buried with their yew bows Shamanic and Magical Practices (Seiðr) Yew Groves: Sacred sites for seiðr practitioners and völvas (seeresses) Staff Making: Seiðr staffs (völr/gandr) sometimes made from yew Death Walking: Yew facilitated trance states for journeying to Hel Protective Barriers: Yew branches placed around sacred spaces during rituals WARNING: Historical sources suggest burning or inhaling yew smoke - NEVER do this, it's deadly Funeral and Death Rites Cemetery Planting: Yew trees planted at burial sites across Northern Europe Corpse Preservation: Yew's antimicrobial properties may have influenced this practice Soul Protection: Yew guarded the dead from disturbance Resurrection Symbol: Evergreen nature symbolized life continuing after death Ancestral Connection: Ancient yews became ancestor spirits themselves Sacred Texts and References Poetic Edda: Mentions yew wood in weapon kennings Anglo-Saxon Rune Poem: \"Eoh (yew) is a tree with rough bark, hard and fast in the earth, supported by its roots, a guardian of flame and a joy upon an estate.\" Old Norse Rune Poem: \"Ýr er vetrgreennstr viða; vant er, er brennr, at sviða.\" (Yew is the greenest of trees in winter; it is wont to crackle when it burns.) Icelandic Rune Poem: \"Ýr er bendr bogi ok brotgjarnt járn ok fífu fárbauti.\" (Yew is a bent bow and brittle iron and giant of the arrow.) Saga References: Multiple sagas mention yew bows and their legendary accuracy Traditional Preparation Methods CRITICAL WARNING The preparation methods below are listed for HISTORICAL and ACADEMIC purposes ONLY. NEVER attempt to prepare yew for internal use. Even external preparations can be absorbed through skin and cause poisoning. Modern practice focuses on non-toxic uses only. Rune Stave Preparation (Safe) Materials: Yew branch, saw, knife, sandpaper, natural oil Safety: Wear gloves when cutting. Do not inhale sawdust. Wash hands thoroughly. Select straight-grained branch 1-2 inches diameter Cut to desired length with saw (outdoors, upwind of sawdust) Remove bark (bark is highly toxic - dispose safely) Season wood in dry place for 4-12 weeks Sand smooth (wear dust mask) Carve runes with sharp tool Seal with linseed oil or beeswax Historical Toxic Preparations (DO NOT ATTEMPT) Listed for academic knowledge only - these are LETHAL: Arrow Poison: Historical sources mention yew sap used to poison arrows (Germanic tribes) \"Death Brew\": Yew needles steeped in mead - used for ritual suicide or execution (Julius Caesar documented this among Gauls) Shamanic Trance: Some sources suggest micro-dosing yew for altered states - EXTREMELY dangerous and often fatal Ordeal Poison: Trial by yew - accused would drink yew tea; survival indicated innocence (most died) Modern Understanding: There are NO safe doses of yew for internal use. Historical \"survivors\" were likely given placebos or different plants. Modern Pharmaceutical Use ONLY by medical professionals in controlled settings: Taxol/Paclitaxel: Chemotherapy drug derived from Pacific Yew (Taxus brevifolia) Cancer Treatment: Used for ovarian, breast, lung, and other cancers Professional Only: Requires precise dosing, medical supervision Side Effects: Even medicinal use has severe side effects Never DIY: Attempting to extract or use yew for cancer is suicide Safety Information Toxicity Profile Toxic Compounds: Taxine alkaloids (taxine A and B), taxol Lethal Dose: 50-100g of needles (adult), far less for children Mechanism: Cardiac depression, conduction blockade, sudden cardiac arrest Onset: 1-5 hours after ingestion, often with minimal warning symptoms No Antidote: Treatment is supportive only (gastric lavage, activated charcoal, cardiac monitoring) Survival Rate: Very low if significant amount ingested All Toxic Parts Needles: Extremely toxic, even when dried Bark: Highly toxic, especially inner bark Seeds: Deadly - even one seed can harm a child Wood: Contains toxins, sawdust is dangerous Roots: Toxic, contaminate groundwater Red Aril (Berry Flesh): Only non-toxic part, but seed inside is deadly Exposure Risks Ingestion: Most dangerous - often fatal Inhalation: Sawdust or smoke inhalation can cause poisoning Skin Absorption: Possible with prolonged contact, especially with broken skin Children & Pets: Extremely vulnerable - single berry (with seed) can kill Livestock: Horses and cattle highly susceptible - deaths common from browsing yew Safe Handling Practices Gloves: Always wear gloves when handling yew Dust Mask: Wear when cutting, carving, or sanding Ventilation: Work outdoors or in well-ventilated area Clean Up: Dispose of all trimmings safely (deep burial or municipal waste) Wash Thoroughly: Hands, tools, work area after handling No Burning: NEVER burn yew - smoke is toxic No Composting: Don't compost yew - toxins persist Child Safety: Keep children and pets away from yew trees Emergency Response If yew ingestion suspected: Call Emergency Services Immediately: 911 (US), 999 (UK), 112 (EU) Poison Control: 1-800-222-1222 (US) Do NOT induce vomiting Do NOT give activated charcoal unless instructed by medical professional Bring plant sample to hospital for identification Monitor cardiac function - death usually from heart failure Legal and Ethical Considerations Not Regulated: Yew trees are legal to grow (common ornamental) Liability: Property owners liable if yew poisoning occurs on their land Warning Signs: Consider posting warnings near yew trees Ethical Responsibility: Never give or recommend yew for any internal use Cultural Respect: Study historical uses but don't romanticize deadly practices Modern Practice and Usage Contemporary Norse Paganism (Heathenry) Rune Crafting: Yew remains popular for rune staves (with proper safety) Altar Decoration: Small yew branches (handled safely) on Ullr altars Offerings: Planting yew trees as living offerings to Ullr or Odin Cemetery Rituals: Visiting ancient yew trees in graveyards for ancestral connection Meditation: Sitting beneath ancient yews for contemplation of death/rebirth Archery Practice: Modern Heathens may practice archery in honor of Ullr Non-Toxic Modern Uses Woodworking: Furniture, decorative items (with proper safety equipment) Bow Making: Traditional archery enthusiasts still use yew for longbows Ornamental: Hedge plants, topiary, garden specimens Conservation: Ancient yew preservation projects across Europe Photography: Ancient yews as spiritual art subjects Spiritual Symbolism (Non-Physical Use) Meditation Symbol: Contemplate yew's paradox without physical use Death Work: Yew as symbol when processing grief, endings, transitions Transformation: Invoke yew's energy for major life changes Protection Magic: Visualize yew's strength without physical contact Ancestor Work: Visit ancient yews to connect with deep time Academic and Educational Use Dendrochronology: Ancient yews provide climate data spanning millennia Archaeology: Yew artifacts reveal ancient crafting techniques Mythology Studies: Understanding Norse worldview through sacred plants Ethnobotany: Human-plant relationships across cultures Toxicology: Studying plant toxins for medical knowledge Substitutions for Safe Practice For those who want yew's spiritual energy without the danger: Oak: Similar longevity and strength symbolism Pine: Evergreen, easier to work with, far less toxic Rowan: Protective qualities, Norse tradition, safer Ash: Direct Yggdrasil connection, strong wood for staves Juniper: Evergreen, protective, can be burned safely for purification Cross-References Related Deities Ullr -
