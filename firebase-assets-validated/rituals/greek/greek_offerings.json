  "description": "At the heart of Greek religious practice\nstood the offering - the fundamental transaction between mortals and immortals. Through animal sacrifice,\nlibations, dedications, and votive gifts, worshippers honored the gods, sought divine favor, fulfilled vows, and maintained the reciprocal\nrelationship (\"I give so that you may give\")\nthat sustained cosmic and social order.",
