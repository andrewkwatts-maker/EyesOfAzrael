  "longDescription": "Yarrow (Achillea millefolium) is one of the most magically and medicinally significant herbs in Norse and Germanic tradition, known for its powerful healing properties, protective qualities, and use in divination. The herb's name Achillea derives from the Greek hero Achilles, who used yarrow to staunch his warriors' wounds during the Trojan War, but yarrow was equally important in Northern European cultures. In Norse tradition, yarrow was associated with warriors, healing magic, and divination. The herb's ability to stop bleeding made it essential in Viking medical kits, earning names like 'soldier's woundwort' and 'bloodwort.' Yarrow was used by völvas (Norse seeresses) in divination rituals, and warriors carried it for protection and courage. The feathery leaves and sturdy stem made yarrow ideal for casting lots and reading omens. Beyond medicine and magic, yarrow had extensive use in Norse folk practices for love divination, weather magic, and blessing rituals.",

The plant's ability to grow in harsh conditions mirrors the Norse ideal of thriving despite hardship. Yarrow's use in divination connects it to the Norns and wyrd (fate), representing the human desire to glimpse destiny while accepting its immutable nature."
