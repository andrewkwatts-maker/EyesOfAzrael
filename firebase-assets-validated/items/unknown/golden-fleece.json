The ram flew the children away from Boeotia, but Helle\n                    fell into the sea (thereafter called the Hellespont) while Phrixus safely reached Colchis.\n                \n                \n                    In gratitude for his deliverance, Phrixus sacrificed the ram to Zeus and gave its golden\n                    fleece to King Aeetes of Colchis, who hung it in a sacred grove dedicated to Ares.

With the help of Medea,\n                    Aeetes' daughter and a powerful sorceress who fell in love with Jason, the hero completed\n                    these trials and claimed the Fleece."
