This legendary weapon is depicted as a razor-sharp, spinning disc\n                    with 108 serrated edges, capable of pursuing any target across the universe and\n                    destroying anything in its path. It is one of the most iconic symbols of Vishnu\n                    and appears in virtually every depiction of the god.\n                \n                \n                    The name \"Sudarshana\" combines \"su\" (auspicious/beautiful) and \"darshana\" (vision/\n                    sight), suggesting that to behold this weapon is auspicious - though for Vishnu's\n                    enemies, it is the last sight they will ever see. The discus represents both the\n                    sun (as a spinning disc of light) and the cosmic order that Vishnu maintains.\n                \n                \n                    In Vaishnava tradition, the Sudarshana Chakra is personified as a deity in its\n                    own right - Sudarshana Chakra can take human form and is worshipped independently\n                    in certain temples. This personification emphasizes that Vishnu's weapons are not\n                    mere objects but conscious entities serving the divine will.",

Her father Vishvakarma, the\n                    divine architect, placed Surya on his lathe and shaved off the excess radiance.\n                    From this celestial material, Vishvakarma fashioned three divine weapons: the\n                    Sudarshana Chakra for Vishnu, the Trishula (trident) for Shiva, and the\n                    Pushpaka Vimana (flying chariot) for Kubera.\n                \n\n                Gift from Shiva\n                \n                    Another tradition holds that Vishnu obtained the Sudarshana Chakra from Shiva\n                    as a reward for devoted worship. In this version, Vishnu performed intense\n                    tapasya (austerities) to Shiva, offering a thousand lotus flowers daily. When\n                    Shiva tested him by hiding one lotus, Vishnu plucked out his own eye (which is\n                    lotus-shaped) to complete the offering. Pleased by this devotion, Shiva\n                    granted him the Sudarshana Chakra.\n                \n\n                Primordial Existence\n                \n                    Some Vaishnava texts maintain that the Sudarshana Chakra has existed eternally\n                    with Vishnu, being an inseparable aspect of the god rather than a created object.\n                    In this view, the chakra is a manifestation of Vishnu's cosmic power to maintain\n                    order and destroy evil.",

This spinning disc possesses 108 serrated edges that can cut through anything, both material and spiritual. The Chakra represents the wheel of time (kala-chakra), the cycle of creation and destruction, and Vishnu's role as the preserver of cosmic order. It is said to be self-powered, eternally spinning, and possessing unlimited energy. When thrown, the Sudarshana Chakra pursues its target with unfailing accuracy, can multiply itself to attack multiple enemies simultaneously, and returns to Vishnu's hand after completing its mission. The weapon is personified as a deity and considered an extension of Vishnu's will.",
