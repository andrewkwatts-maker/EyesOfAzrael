  "longDescription": "The Trident (Greek: τρίαινα triaina) is the three-pronged spear wielded by Poseidon, god of the sea. Like Zeus's thunderbolt and Hades's helm, it was forged by the Cyclopes as a gift after their liberation from Tartarus. The trident grants Poseidon complete dominion over all waters—he can calm or raise storms, create springs by striking rock, cause earthquakes (earning him the epithet 'Earthshaker'), and command all sea creatures. The three prongs have been interpreted as symbolizing Poseidon's threefold dominion over seas, rivers, and springs, or his power over past, present, and future tides. As a symbol of marine sovereignty, the trident represents both the creative and destructive aspects of water.",
