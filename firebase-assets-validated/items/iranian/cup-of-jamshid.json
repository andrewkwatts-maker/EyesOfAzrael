Under his reign, which lasted 700 years, there was no disease, death, or\n                    suffering. He is credited with discovering medicine, dividing society into classes,\n                    teaching metalworking, and establishing Nowruz (the Persian New Year).\n                \n                \n                    However, Jamshid's downfall came through pride. After centuries of glorious rule, he\n                    began to believe his achievements were his own rather than gifts from Ahura Mazda\n                    (the supreme god). His divine farr (kingly glory) departed, and he was eventually\n                    overthrown and killed by the serpent-shouldered tyrant Zahhak.\n                \n\n                \n                    \"The cup of Jamshid wherein the world was reflected - seek it in the ruins of the heart.\"\n                    — Hafez, Persian Sufi poet\n                \n\n                Sufi Interpretation\n                \n                    In Sufi poetry, the Cup of Jamshid became a powerful mystical symbol. The cup represents\n                    the heart of the spiritual seeker, which when purified becomes a mirror reflecting\n                    divine truth. The world-revealing power of the cup symbolizes enlightenment and the\n                    direct perception of reality that comes through spiritual discipline.\n                \n                \n                    Poets like Hafez and Rumi used the Cup of Jamshid as a metaphor for the soul's journey\n                    toward God, suggesting that the true cup is not an external object but the polished\n                    heart of the mystic who has transcended ego and worldly attachments.",
