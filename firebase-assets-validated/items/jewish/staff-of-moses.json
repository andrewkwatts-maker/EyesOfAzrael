When Moses\n                    successfully pulled the staff from the ground, Jethro recognized him as the one destined\n                    to deliver Israel.\n                \n\n                \n                    \"And you shall take in your hand this staff, with which you shall do the signs.\"\n                    — Exodus 4:17\n                \n\n                The Name of God\n                \n                    Some traditions hold that the Ineffable Name of God (YHWH) was inscribed upon the staff,\n                    being the source of its miraculous power. This connection between the divine Name and\n                    supernatural ability appears throughout Jewish mystical literature.\n                \n\n                Islamic Tradition\n                \n                    In Islamic tradition, the staff (Asa Musa) features prominently in the Quran's account\n                    of Moses (Musa).
