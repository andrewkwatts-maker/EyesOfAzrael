In the Enuma Elish (the Babylonian creation epic), Tiamat, enraged by the death of her consort Apsu, creates eleven monsters to wage war against the gods: After Marduk defeated Tiamat and established the cosmic order, these creatures were not destroyed but reassigned to serve protective functions, guarding sacred places and boundaries. Thus the Scorpion-Men transformed from warriors of chaos to sentinels of divine order.",
