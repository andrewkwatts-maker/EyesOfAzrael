  "symbolism": "The traditional Sphinx combines all four Kerubim: the body of a bull, the paws of a lion, the wings of an eagle, and the head of a human. This composite creature represents the integration of all four elements and the mastery required to solve the riddle of existence. The Sphinx asks, \"What walks on four legs in the morning, two at noon, and three in the evening?\" The answer— humanity—points to the human (Aquarius) as the synthesizing principle that understands all stages of manifestation.",
