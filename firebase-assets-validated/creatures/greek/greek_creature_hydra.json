  "detailed_appearance": "The Lernaean Hydra presents a nightmarish spectacle of serpentine horror. Its primary body is that of a massive water serpent, covered in dark green-black scales that gleam with a sickly sheen when wet. The scales are thick and overlapping, providing natural armor against most weapons.\n\nWhat makes the Hydra truly terrifying is its multiple heads - typically nine in number, though some accounts suggest more. Each head is as large as a horse, with massive jaws lined with rows of needle-sharp fangs. The heads move independently, writhing and snapping at different targets simultaneously. The central head is the immortal one, slightly larger and more intelligent than the others, with golden eyes that burn with malevolent awareness.\n\nFrom the creature's neck stumps, where heads have been severed, twin growths emerge, creating an ever-increasing forest of serpentine horror. The Hydra's breath is poisonous, capable of killing with its mere exhalation, and its blood is so venomous that even its scent can cause death. The creature's tail is thick and powerful, capable of crushing stone, and it moves through water with terrifying speed.",
