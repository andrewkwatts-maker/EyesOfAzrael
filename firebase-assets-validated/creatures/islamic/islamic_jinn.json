  "mythology_story": "Unlike humans created from clay and angels created from light , jinn were created from \"marij min nar \" - a smokeless flame of fire. This fiery origin grants them unique properties: they can move at tremendous speeds, change forms, and exist in dimensions beyond normal human perception. Their creation predates humanity, as mentioned in the Quran : \"And the jinn We created before from scorching fire\" (15:27).",
