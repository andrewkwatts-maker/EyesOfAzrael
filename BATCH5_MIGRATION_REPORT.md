## Migration Strategy

Each migrated HTML file's content was stored in Firebase Firestore under a `batch5_migration` field within the corresponding Firebase document. The migration preserved:

1. **Original HTML content** (full raw HTML)
2. **Extracted text content** (HTML tags stripped)
3. **Metadata:**
   - Source file path
   - Migration timestamp
   - Original word count
   - Migration percentage
   - Content length

This allows future analysis and potential rollback if needed, while enabling the deletion of source HTML files to reduce repository size.
