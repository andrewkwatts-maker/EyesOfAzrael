## Submitting Theories

### **What Makes a Good Theory Submission?**

1. **Clear Hypothesis**
   - State your main claim explicitly
   - Explain what you're proposing

2. **Evidence & Analysis**
   - Provide specific examples
   - Show patterns or correlations
   - Cite sources

3. **Intellectual Honesty**
   - Acknowledge weaknesses
   - Mention alternative explanations
   - Admit when you're speculating

4. **Structured Data**
   - Use the theory-specific fields
   - Provide confidence ratings
   - List testable predictions if possible

---

### **Confidence Score (0-100)**

Rate your own theory honestly:

- **90-100:** Proven fact, experimentally verified
  - Example: "The I Ching has exactly 64 hexagrams" (factual observation)

- **70-89:** Strong correlation, statistically significant
  - Example: "72 appears cross-culturally in sacred numbers" (well-documented pattern)

- **50-69:** Moderate correlation, plausible hypothesis
  - Example: "The 10 Sefirot may parallel 10-dimensional M-theory" (structural similarity)

- **30-49:** Weak correlation, interesting pattern
  - Example: "12 gates in Revelation may encode 12 spatial dimensions" (numerology)

- **10-29:** Highly speculative, creative interpretation
  - Example: "Egyptian deity names phonetically match element symbols" (linguistic coincidence likely)

- **0-9:** Pure speculation, thought experiment
  - Example: "Ancient aliens taught physics to mystics" (unfalsifiable claim)

---

### **Intellectual Honesty Warnings**

**Always include:**
1. **Most likely alternative explanation**
   - What's the simplest interpretation?
   - Could this be coincidence?

2. **Cognitive biases to watch for**
   - Confirmation bias (highlighting matches, ignoring mismatches)
   - Apophenia (seeing patterns in random data)
   - Retrofitting (forcing modern concepts onto ancient texts)

3. **Methodological limitations**
   - What can't you test?
   - What assumptions are you making?
   - What's the quality of your evidence?

**Example:**
> "Most likely explanation: The number 12 is symbolically ubiquitous in ancient cultures (12 months, 12 zodiac signs, 12 tribes). Retrofitting modern physics (12 dimensions in F-theory) onto this is confirmation bias. Treat as creative thought experiment, not literal encoding of physics knowledge."

## Sources & Citations

### **How to Cite Sources:**

**Primary Sources** (ancient texts):
```
Title: The Iliad
Author: Homer
Date: c. 8th century BCE
Type: Primary
Relevance: Comprehensive
```

**Secondary Sources** (modern scholarship):
```
Title: The Greek Myths
Author: Robert Graves
Date: 1955
Type: Secondary
Relevance: Significant
URL: [if available]
```

**Archaeological Evidence:**
```
Title: Temple of Zeus excavation, Olympia
Date: Discovered 1829
Type: Archaeological
Relevance: Minor
```

### **Citation Quality:**
- **Primary sources** (ancient texts, inscriptions) are best
- **Academic secondary sources** (peer-reviewed papers, scholarly books) are valuable
- **Popular sources** (Wikipedia, blogs) can be used but note their limitations
- **Personal gnosis/UPG** (unverified personal gnosis) should be clearly labeled as such

## Cross-Cultural Parallels

If your submission relates to concepts in other mythologies, mention them!

**Examples:**
- Thunder gods: Zeus (Greek), Thor (Norse), Indra (Hindu), Raijin (Japanese)
- Flood myths: Noah (Judeo-Christian), Utnapishtim (Mesopotamian), Manu (Hindu)
- Tricksters: Loki (Norse), Anansi (African), Coyote (Native American)

This helps users discover connections across traditions.

## Example: Complete Theory Submission

### **Title:**
"Norse Ragnarök & Heat Death of the Universe"

### **Content Type:**
Theory

### **Short Description:**
"The Norse myth of Ragnarök (cosmic destruction followed by renewal) may encode understanding of cosmological cycles similar to modern heat death and Big Bounce theories."

### **Mythologies:**
[x] Norse

### **Primary Mythology:**
Norse

### **Full Description:**
```markdown
## Core Hypothesis

The Norse myth of Ragnarök describes the cyclical destruction and renewal of the cosmos.
This theory proposes that this narrative may encode observations or intuitions about
cosmological processes that modern physics describes as heat death, entropy, and
potential cyclic cosmologies (Big Bounce, conformal cyclic cosmology).

## Key Parallels

### 1. Fimbulwinter (The Great Winter)
**Myth:** Three winters with no summer, cosmic cold before Ragnarök
**Physics:** Heat death of universe (maximum entropy, thermal equilibrium, T→0K)
**Correlation Strength:** 70% - Both describe final state as cold, dark, lifeless

### 2. Cosmic Fire (Surtr's Flames)
**Myth:** The fire giant Surtr engulfs the world in flames
**Physics:** Potential Big Crunch or cosmic conflagration (if dark energy reverses)
**Correlation Strength:** 50% - Contradicts heat death (cold vs. hot end), but both describe total transformation

### 3. Renewal (Líf and Lífþrasir Survive)
**Myth:** A new world emerges, two humans repopulate
**Physics:** Big Bounce / Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (universe reborn after death)
**Correlation Strength:** 60% - Both describe cyclic nature rather than single endpoint

## Testable Predictions

None directly testable, as this is comparative mythology/physics philosophy.

However, if cyclic cosmology models gain experimental support, this would strengthen
the correlation. If heat death is confirmed as the universe's final state with no
renewal mechanism, the Norse myth's "renewal" aspect would be metaphorical/wishful
rather than prescient.

## Intellectual Honesty Warnings

**Most Likely Explanation:**
Cyclic cosmologies are HUMAN INTUITIONS, not unique insights. Many cultures have
creation-destruction-renewal cycles (Hindu yugas, Aztec Five Suns, Buddhist kalpas).
This reflects:
- Agricultural cycles (seasons, planting/harvest)
- Day/night cycle
- Human life cycle (birth/death/rebirth)
- Psychological need for hope (world doesn't end permanently)

**Cognitive Biases:**
- Confirmation bias: Highlighting "heat death" from Fimbulwinter while ignoring Surtr's FIRE (contradictory)
- Retrofitting: Forcing modern physics onto 1000+ year old myths
- Selection bias: Many myths DON'T have renewal (Abrahamic end times are linear, not cyclic)

**Alternative Interpretation:**
Ragnarök likely reflects:
- Norse cultural trauma (volcanic eruptions, harsh winters, societal collapse fears)
- Eschatological hope (even gods can die, but life renews)
- Moral/theological meaning (Odin's failure, new gods needed)

**Verdict:**
This correlation reflects UNIVERSAL HUMAN PATTERNS (cycles, renewal) rather than
encoded cosmological physics. Treat as comparative philosophy, not ancient science.
```

### **Abstract:**
"Analysis of potential parallels between Norse Ragnarök myth and modern cosmological theories of universal heat death and cyclic cosmologies."

### **Confidence Score:**
45

### **Intellectual Honesty Warnings:**
"Most likely explanation: Cyclic cosmologies are universal human cognitive patterns reflecting seasonal/agricultural cycles, not encoded physics. The correlation reflects common metaphors, not ancient scientific knowledge. Treat as comparative philosophy."

### **Physics Connections:**
"Heat death (maximum entropy), Big Bounce, Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (Penrose), thermodynamic arrow of time"

1. Völuspá (Poetic Edda), c. 10th century CE, Primary, Comprehensive
2. Prose Edda (Snorri Sturluson), c. 1220 CE, Primary, Comprehensive
