## Intellectual Honesty

### For Theories and Interpretations

If your submission includes modern theories or speculative content:

1. **Clearly Label Speculation**
   - Mark theoretical sections clearly
   - Use phrases like "Some scholars suggest..." or "One interpretation is..."
   - Distinguish between established fact and speculation

2. **Provide Counter-Arguments**
   - Present mainstream academic consensus
   - Acknowledge competing theories
   - Don't cherry-pick evidence

3. **Use Appropriate Language**
   - "May suggest" instead of "proves"
   - "Could indicate" instead of "definitely shows"
   - "Interesting correlation" instead of "direct connection"

4. **Example of Good Practice:**

```
GOOD:
"Some researchers have proposed connections between Norse and Hindu
cosmology, noting similarities in creation myths. However, mainstream
scholars generally attribute these parallels to universal human concerns
about origins rather than direct cultural transmission."

BAD:
"Norse and Hindu myths are clearly connected, proving ancient global
contact between civilizations."
```

### For Traditional Content

Even traditional mythological content requires honesty:
- Note when sources conflict
- Acknowledge gaps in knowledge
- Distinguish between early and late sources
- Mention regional variations

## Examples of Excellent Submissions

### Example 1: Deity Submission

**Name:** Bastet
**Mythology:** Egyptian
**Domains:** Protection, cats, joy, dance, music

**Description:**
Bastet is an ancient Egyptian goddess who evolved from a fierce lioness warrior deity to a benevolent cat goddess. Originally depicted as a lioness, she was associated with the protective aspects of the Eye of Ra. By the Second Dynasty (c. 2890 BCE), she began to be shown with a gentler cat's head, reflecting her transformation into a goddess of home, fertility, and protection.

In her later form, Bastet became one of the most popular deities in Egypt, particularly during the Late Period (664-332 BCE). She was believed to protect the home from evil spirits and disease, especially threats to women and children. Her role extended to music and dance, and her festivals were known for their joyous celebrations.

**Sacred Symbols:** Cat, sistrum (musical instrument), lioness
**Sacred Sites:** Bubastis (Per-Bast)
**Related Deities:** Ra (father), Sekhmet (alternate form)

### Example 2: Hero Submission

**Name:** Cú Chulainn
**Alternate Names:** Cúchulainn, Sétanta (birth name)
**Mythology:** Irish Celtic

**Description:**
Cú Chulainn is the greatest hero of Ulster in Irish mythology, central to the Ulster Cycle of legends. Born as Sétanta, he earned his adult name ("Hound of Culann") after slaying the guard dog of the smith Culann and offering to take its place until a replacement could be trained.

Known for his superhuman combat abilities and his terrifying battle frenzy (ríastrad), Cú Chulainn single-handedly defended Ulster against the armies of Queen Medb of Connacht in the epic Táin Bó Cúailnge (Cattle Raid of Cooley). His exploits include training with the warrior woman Scáthach in Scotland, from whom he learned his signature move, the gae bolga.

**Family:** Son of the god Lugh and mortal Deichtine
**Notable Deeds:** Defense of Ulster, Training with Scáthach, Slaying Culann's hound
**Death:** Killed while defending Ulster, tied himself to a standing stone to die on his feet
