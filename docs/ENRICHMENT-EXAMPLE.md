**Answer**: "The Rice Bearer - God of Prosperity, Foxes, and Abundance"

*Limited information, no historical context*

### After Enrichment
**Question**: "What does Inari represent and why is it so important?"

**Answer**: "Inari is a rice/prosperity deity originating in early Heian period (8th-9th century) as an agricultural blessing. Originally worshipped by farmers for harvest prosperity, Inari evolved to become the most ubiquitous kami in Japan (30,000+ shrines) and the only major deity with strong merchant-class patronage. This religious flexibility allowed Inari to transcend social class boundaries - simultaneously worshipped by imperial court, merchants, and farmers. Associated with the Tantric Buddhist deity Dakiniten during the medieval period of Buddhist-Shinto syncretism, Inari represents one of the most successful religious adaptations in Japanese history, evolving from agricultural blessing to commercial prosperity symbol. The deity's fox (kitsune) messengers appear in extensive folklore traditions, and Inari remains popular in modern business culture as a blessing for commercial success."
