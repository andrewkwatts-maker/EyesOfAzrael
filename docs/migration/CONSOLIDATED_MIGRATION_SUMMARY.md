## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Incremental Migration:** Starting with pilot (Greek) established patterns
2. **Automation:** Investing in scripts paid off for remaining mythologies
3. **Unified Schema:** Single schema for all entity types simplified development
4. **Validation Early:** Catching issues during extraction prevented downstream problems
5. **Component Reuse:** Modular renderers allowed rapid feature additions

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Data Extraction:** HTML parsing required custom logic for each mythology
2. **Schema Evolution:** Schema refined multiple times during early phases
3. **Performance:** Large datasets required optimization strategies
4. **User Submissions:** Moderation workflow needed careful design
5. **Cross-References:** Maintaining entity relationships across migrations

### Future Recommendations
1. **Versioning:** Implement entity versioning for change tracking
2. **i18n:** Add internationalization for global audience
3. **API:** Expose public API for third-party integrations
4. **Mobile App:** Consider native mobile application
5. **AI Integration:** Use AI for entity relationship discovery
