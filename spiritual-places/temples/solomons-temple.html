            </h2>
            <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                Solomon's Temple, also known as the First Temple (Hebrew: בֵּית־הַמִּקְדָּשׁ הָרִאשׁוֹן, Beit HaMikdash HaRishon),
                was the first holy temple of the ancient Israelites, built in Jerusalem during the reign of King Solomon around
                957 BCE. It served as the primary center of Israelite worship and housed the Ark of the Covenant in its innermost
                sanctuary, the Holy of Holies. The Temple stood for approximately 370 years until its destruction by the
                Babylonians under Nebuchadnezzar II in 586 BCE.
            </p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "So Solomon built the temple and finished it. He lined its interior walls with cedar boards, paneling them
                from the floor of the temple to the ceiling, and covered the floor of the temple with planks of cypress."
                - 1 Kings 6:14-15
            </div>

            <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.1rem; margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                The Temple was built on Mount Moriah (the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite, purchased by David for 50 shekels
                of silver), believed to be the site where Abraham prepared to sacrifice Isaac (the Akedah) and where Jacob dreamed
                of a ladder reaching to heaven. According to Jewish tradition, this was also the Foundation Stone (Even Shetiyah)
                from which the world was created. King David had originally planned to build the Temple after bringing the Ark to
                Jerusalem, but God, through the prophet Nathan, decreed that his son Solomon would be the one to construct it, as
                David had "shed much blood" and been "a man of war" (1 Chronicles 22:8). Nevertheless, David amassed enormous wealth
                for the project—100,000 talents of gold and 1 million talents of silver according to 1 Chronicles 22:14—and
                organized the priestly and Levitical divisions that would serve in the Temple.
            </p>

            <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.1rem; margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                King Solomon, son of David and Bathsheba, ascended to the throne around 970 BCE after a succession crisis involving
                his half-brother Adonijah. According to biblical accounts, Solomon prayed at the ancient sanctuary of Gibeon, where
                God appeared to him in a dream offering to grant any request. Solomon asked for "a discerning heart to govern your
                people," which pleased God so much that He also granted Solomon wealth, honor, and long life (1 Kings 3:9-14). The
                young king's legendary wisdom became proverbial—he authored 3,000 proverbs and 1,005 songs, and "spoke about plant
                life, from the cedar of Lebanon to the hyssop" (1 Kings 4:32-33). Rulers from distant lands, including the Queen of
                Sheba, came to Jerusalem to hear his judgments and marvel at his court's splendor.
            </p>

            <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.1rem; margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                The construction took seven years (c. 967-960 BCE, in the 4th through 11th years of Solomon's reign) and employed
                a massive workforce described in meticulous detail in 1 Kings 5-6 and 2 Chronicles 2-4. Solomon conscripted 30,000
                men from Israel who worked in monthly shifts in Lebanon (10,000 per month, allowing two months at home between
                shifts), along with 70,000 carriers, 80,000 stonecutters in the mountains, and 3,300 (or 3,600 according to
                2 Chronicles) foremen overseeing the work. The project required unprecedented international cooperation: King Hiram
                of Tyre, an ally of David and friend to Solomon, provided cedar and cypress timber from the forests of Lebanon,
                along with skilled Phoenician craftsmen renowned throughout the ancient world. In exchange, Solomon supplied Hiram
                with 20,000 cors (approximately 125,000 bushels) of wheat and 20 cors of pressed olive oil annually throughout the
                construction period.
            </p>

            <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.1rem; margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                The master craftsman Hiram-Abi (also called Huram-Abi), son of a Tyrian bronze worker and an Israelite mother from
                the tribe of Naphtali (or Dan according to 2 Chronicles), was brought from Tyre to oversee the intricate metalwork.
                He was "filled with wisdom, understanding, and skill for making any work in bronze" (1 Kings 7:14) and created the
                two great pillars Jachin and Boaz, the enormous Bronze Sea, the ten bronze lavers, and countless vessels and
                furnishings. Materials were imported from throughout the ancient world: cedar and cypress from Lebanon (floated as
                rafts down the Mediterranean coast to Joppa, then transported overland 35 miles to Jerusalem), gold from Ophir
                (possibly in Arabia, East Africa, or India—420 talents for the Temple), precious stones, algum wood (possibly red
                sandalwood), and massive dressed stones quarried locally from the limestone hills around Jerusalem.
            </p>

            <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.1rem; margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                The foundation stones were enormous—some measuring 15 cubits (about 22.5 feet) long. The stones were so precisely
                cut and dressed at the quarry that "neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron was heard in the temple while it was
                being built" (1 Kings 6:7). This remarkable construction technique maintained the sanctity of the site, as iron was
                associated with warfare, bloodshed, and the curse upon the earth after the Fall. The Talmud records that Solomon
                possessed the miraculous shamir worm (or stone), a creature "no bigger than a barleycorn" that could cut through
                stone with its gaze, bequeathed to Solomon by Asmodeus, king of demons. Modern scholars suggest the silent
                construction may indicate pre-fabrication of all components at external sites.
            </p>

            <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.1rem; margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                The Temple's completion in 960 BCE (the 11th year of Solomon's reign, in the month of Bul, the 8th month) was
                followed by an elaborate dedication ceremony that lasted fourteen days, coinciding with and extending beyond the
                Feast of Tabernacles (Sukkot). Solomon offered 22,000 cattle and 120,000 sheep and goats in sacrifice—a staggering
                number that required the consecration of the middle of the courtyard as additional altar space, since the bronze
                altar was insufficient for all the offerings (1 Kings 8:64). When the Ark of the Covenant was brought into the Holy
                of Holies beneath the wings of the golden cherubim, the glory of the Lord (Shekhinah) filled the Temple in a cloud
                so dense that the priests could not stand to minister (1 Kings 8:10-11). Fire descended from heaven to consume the
                offerings, and all the people fell prostrate, worshiping and praising: "He is good; his love endures forever"
                (2 Chronicles 7:3). Solomon delivered his famous prayer of dedication from a bronze platform in the courtyard,
                acknowledging that even the highest heaven cannot contain God, yet asking Him to hear prayers offered toward this
                place.

                Religious & Mythological Significance
            </h2>

            <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                Solomon's Temple represented the physical dwelling place of God on Earth (Hebrew: שכינה, Shekhinah - Divine Presence).
                It served as the central point of contact between the divine and human realms, where sacrifices were offered,
                prayers were heard, and festivals were celebrated. The Temple embodied the covenant between God and the people
                of Israel, manifesting divine order in physical form.

                    <p>The Temple's most sacred element was the Ark of the Covenant, containing:</p>
                    <ul class="list-styled">
                        <li>Two tablets inscribed with the Ten Commandments</li>

                        <li>A pot of manna from the wilderness</li>
                        <li>The mercy seat (kapporet) where God's presence dwelt</li>
                        <li>Two golden cherubim facing each other above the Ark</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                        The Ark disappeared after the Temple's destruction, becoming one of history's greatest mysteries and
                        the subject of countless legends and searches.

            <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                The destruction of Solomon's Temple in 586 BCE by the Babylonian army under Nebuchadnezzar II was one of the
                most traumatic events in Jewish history. The prophets had warned that Israel's idolatry and injustice would
                lead to catastrophe, but the loss of the Temple—the physical manifestation of God's presence—devastated the
                nation. The Temple treasures were looted, the building was burned, and the walls were torn down. The Ark of
                the Covenant disappeared and has never been recovered.

                The Second Temple Period (516 BCE - 70 CE)
            </h2>

            <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                After seventy years of Babylonian exile, the Jewish people returned to Jerusalem and rebuilt the Temple, inaugurating
                the Second Temple period that would last nearly 600 years. This era witnessed dramatic transformations in Jewish thought,
                the emergence of various sects, Greek and Roman occupation, the ministry of Jesus, and ultimately another catastrophic
                destruction—this time by the Romans in 70 CE. The Second Temple, especially after Herod's massive expansion, became one
                of the ancient world's architectural marvels, yet it lacked several sacred elements present in Solomon's Temple.

                "As Jesus was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said to him, 'Look, Teacher! What massive stones! What
                magnificent buildings!' 'Do you see all these great buildings?' replied Jesus. 'Not one stone here will be left
                on another; every one will be thrown down.'" - Mark 13:1-2

                The destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE was as traumatic as the first destruction 656 years earlier. This time,
                however, the Jewish people would not return to rebuild. The Temple Mount remained in ruins until the 7th century, when
                Muslims built the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque on the site. The loss of the Temple forced a radical
                transformation of Judaism from a temple-centered religion of sacrifice to a synagogue-centered religion of prayer and
                study—a transformation that shapes Judaism to this day.

                The Temple Mount (Hebrew: Har HaBayit; Arabic: al-Haram al-Sharif) remains one of the most contested and
                sacred sites in the world. Archaeological investigation is extremely limited due to religious and political
                sensitivities. The site is managed by the Islamic Waqf, while the Western Wall plaza serves as a Jewish
                prayer site. The Temple continues to play a central role in Jewish liturgy, eschatology, and identity.
